6-Dec-06,"Men's clothing can be feminine, flirty","Shacking may once have been the reason girls wore their boyfriend's clothes, but this is no longer the case according to today's fashion designers.
It has become uber-trendy for women to yearn for the clothing in their man's closet.
Fashion leaders have designed menswear for women, and according to New York Magazine this trend is taking over for the winter season.


 


Starting with outerwear, it is clear why men's clothing has an influence on new designs for women.
Belted trench coats and tweed jackets are suitable in cold weather yet have details that make them flirty enough for women to wear. Such jackets are tailored slimmer for women, but still allow the wearer to exude a powerful and influential vibe.
Tailored and sweater vests are popular looks for women this winter, both influenced by the ever-popular three piece suit.
While women who wear this look often choose to go without a suit, the addition of a vest spices up a plain outfit.
Oxford shirts have always reigned as popular for women who steal their boyfriend's favorite top, but with a twist and a belt, girls can make this shirt memorable.
A simple yet classic twist that women can add to the Oxford shirt is gold cuff links. These do not have to be expensive and creativity is key, so experiment with jewel tones and faux diamonds, something the men in your life surely do not take advantage of.
Going along with updating men's formal wear, the tuxedo coat or tailcoat is fabulous on a woman. Although you may think that Diane Keaton is the only girl to ever don the tux, many fabulously feminine celebrities have been spotted wearing tuxedo tops and black slacks.
Tuxedo pants are also great on women, and fitted blouses perfectly accentuate this look.


 


If accessorizing yourself in your man's closet sounds appealing, then make sure to look out for big and bold face watches. The bigger and bulkier, the better when it comes to picking out watches for women this winter.
Silver, gold or white (think Chanel-style) links with black or white faces will make your wrist visible from miles away.
Men's shoes are also in style for women this winter. Black or brown flat riding boots are flattering on any woman and a classic style you could hold onto for life.
Frye cowboy boots are durable, high-quality boots that are mal- inspired, but popularized by stylish women.
Next time you are in a man's closet, check out these items, or just hit the stores this winter for a full selection of styles.

19-Aug-10,SEC RUNDOWN: LSU,"The Louisiana State Tigers find themselves in an unfamiliar role heading into the new football season — as sleepers.
The Tigers, a perennial power in the South-eastern Conference, were picked to finish fourth in the Western division this season by the media,  marking the first time the Tigers were not projected to be first or second place in the West since 1999.
 


 


“I believe we deserve it, having a lot of young guys coming in and not finishing things right in the last couple of years,” All-SEC defensive back Patrick Peterson said. “It’ll give us motivation to fix things, to just finish strong.”
Linebacker Kelvin Sheppard said he agrees.
“It’s more on the motivational side,” he said. “It’s the preseason rankings, and hopefully towards the end of the year we’re at the top of the list.”
Not surprisingly, Tigers head coach Les Miles — who posted a 34-6 record in his first three seasons at LSU, including a national title in 2007 — has been questioned about being on the hot seat.
Miles does not seem to be worried about his job security, though.
“I’m very fortunate to have a good contract,” he said. “I don’t think that’s the issue. 
“I think the issue is preparing my football team.”
And despite what media prognosticators expect of them, Miles exuded confidence at SEC Media Days.


 


“It will only be a championship season, and that’s the only point and direction of this program,” he said. “That’s where we’re headed.",Ryan Black,sports,https://www.redandblack.com/sports/sec-rundown-lsu/article_5abe1b1b-e476-523b-a123-8d5d844b63c0.html
16-Sep-10,"HOUSTON, THEY HAVE A PROBLEM","As soon as Demarcus Dobbs heard Georgia would be installing a new 3-4 scheme under Todd Grantham, he knew instantly Justin Houston would thrive.
“I said that from the beginning when people were asking me about the new 3-4. I told everyone the people that we had at defensive end, like Justin Houston, this is the perfect system for their type of play,” Dobbs said. “It fit him perfectly. It’s his time to shine now, and he’s showing everybody what he can do.”
Houston’s results speak for themselves thus far this season.


 


In his first two games as an outside linebacker, Houston has already amassed three sacks — 11th in the country individually.
Houston said it hasn’t been as much of an adjustment because about “50 percent” of the time he’s still lining up with his hand on the ground as a 4-3 defensive end in Georgia’s nickel package. And as a stand-up outside linebacker, his main responsibility remains the same as a 4-3 defensive end: Hit the quarterback.
“[Outside linebacker] is going pretty good. I’d be even more happy [with my play] if we had won last Saturday,” Houston said. “For us to win, I got to turn it up a little, so I’m still disappointed in myself. I feel like if I had done more that last game, the game would have been a different outcome. I still got a long ways to go with myself.”
It’s hard to ask for much more from a linebacker than a career-high 10 tackles, two sacks and a momentum-flipping forced fumble Houston produced in the loss to South Carolina.
It’s that same team-first attitude that Houston responds with when asked if he has any goals he’s striving for after finishing second in the SEC in sacks a season ago with 7.5, despite playing in just 10 games.
“I haven’t set any individual goals. Whatever comes, comes,” Houston said. “I’ll look at the stats at the end of the season. Right now I’m just worrying about the victories.”
And for Georgia to escape with a victory on Saturday against Arkansas, the need for a strong rush is greater than any game Georgia may play all season, with Arkansas’ Ryan Mallett, the SEC’s top quarterback, heading to town.
“If you can put pressure on Mallett, and get him moving, that’s a big difference in the game,” Houston said. “He’s got a cannon, so if you just sit there and let him throw, he’ll pick you apart. We’re going to try to put pressure on him and make him move his feet a little more than normal.”


 


Family matters
What’s made this season special so far hasn’t been the individual numbers Houston’s accumulated, but rather, being able to look to his side and know his “brother” — DeAngelo Tyson — is right there with him.
Tyson, a junior, isn’t biologically related to Houston, a redshirt junior, but when you’ve been best friends as long as they have, a reference to family seems more appropriate.
“Me and DeAngelo, we’re like brothers. We’ve known each other since middle school. We started playing ball together when we were in middle school and ever since I’ve played ball he has been on the squad with me,” Houston said. “We are very close, and we’ve been very close for a long time.”
Now, just like they did in high school for three years, Houston is starting alongside Tyson, who plays nose tackle, along the Georgia front seven.
“It’s been great, especially this year he’s actually out there starting with me,” Houston said. “I can look to the side and feel comfortable with this guy playing because I know he’s going to do his job and do what he’s supposed to do because I’ve been playing with him for a while.”
The fact that they’re playing together now is a welcome change from the first time the two met — a meeting that Houston says began his awakening as an athlete.
That meeting came at a middle school basketball team tryout when Houston was in seventh grade, and Tyson, a sixth grader, was selected for the team over Houston — a selection Houston strongly disagreed with.


TNCMS.AdManager.render({region: 'fixed-big-ad-bottom-asset', slot: 1, fold: ""below""});


“I really did feel like I was better than DeAngelo at the time,” Houston said, laughing. “I felt like I was a lot better than him and he made the team over me, but that did motivate me a lot to work hard.”
Added Tyson: “Ever since then that’s the joke that we always used to tell, that I made the sixth grade basketball team and he didn’t. And I think that motivated him to become the great player that he is today, because the next year he was a good player, and we were like, ‘Where did it come from?’”
Ironically, it was Houston selecting the team the two would play for in college, as Tyson told Houston when he was being recruited that “wherever you go, I’m coming there.”
Sure enough, a year after Houston signed with Georgia, Tyson did the same.
“Part of it was Justin, but I also came here because I like Coach [Rodney] Garner. He’s like a father figure in my life,” Tyson said.
Ever since then, the duo has been motivating each other, just as they did nine years ago in that middle school gym.
And although they are teammates now and don’t get to spend much time on the hardwood anymore, they still compete.
“We’re always in the room playing video games, talking trash to each other,” Houston said. “It’s about 50/50 who wins. It depends on what game we’re playing.”

Houston’s game of choice is NBA 2K, while Tyson prefers NCAA College Football. One thing both can agree on, though, is their “pride” in representing Statesboro.
“[Everyone back home] supports us very much,” Houston said. “They send us text messages before and after every game. If they don’t talk to me, they talk to him, asking us how we’re doing, so they support us a lot.”
That hometown support dwarfs in comparison to the support they have for each other, though.
“If he makes a big play on the field, I’m going to go up and congratulate him, same as if I do something like that. I think we have a bond together,” Tyson said.
It is not the type of bond that comes from friendship, it’s more than that.
It’s “more like brothers.”",Nick Parker,sports,https://www.redandblack.com/sports/houston-they-have-a-problem/article_ff868530-7c83-5dda-84f4-6eb9341ed843.html
7-Oct-10,Engineering majors could be approved next week (w/documents),"Next week will mark a crucial step in the University’s path to getting a school of engineering.
John Millsaps, spokesman for the Board of Regents, said the University submitted three different proposals for new undergraduate majors — civil engineering, mechanical engineering and electrical and electronics engineering.
“It’s on the agenda for the meeting next week,” Millsaps said. He said he could not speak as to the factors the Regents would use to make their decision, but said there was a formalized process of getting the proposal to them.


 


If the three new majors are approved, Millsaps said the rest is up to the University.
“The Regents approve the overall degree program, but once the Regents approve it, it is the responsibility of the academic institution to put it in place,” he said.
University officials would not comment on the proposals, only to clarify they were for engineering majors, not for a school of engineering.
“We’re reserving comments beyond the materials we’ve already submitted,” said Tom Jackson, vice president for public affairs.
Scott Angle, dean of the College of Agricultural and Environmental Sciences — where two of the University’s existing engineering degrees, agricultural and biological engineering, are housed — said in an interview last week he could not comment on the progress being made.
“We will still have a department of biological and agricultural engineering, but if those [new majors] happen, those faculty will have a joint appointment,” Angle said.
He said CAES might lose some students if the University gets these new majors, and especially if it is later approved for a school of engineering.
“The three proposed engineering degree programs will address significant needs in Georgia by providing a greater number of graduates to meet engineering workforce demands and expanding access to engineering education opportunities for Georgia residents,” the civil engineering proposal from University President Michael Adams states.


 


“Without engineering and medical schools, UGA has been unable to tap into the expanding federal funds for engineering and medical research, the two major sources of research funds for most academic institutions.”
The need for research is what Agan Tankersley, a senior agricultural engineering major from Swainsboro, said was one reason the University should already have an engineering school.
Tankersley said the proposed majors could mean significant changes for students already in the engineering programs.
“Depending on the curriculum for those majors, I do think they will affect the numbers of people in ag engineering,” he said.
Miles Keeney-Ritchie, a fifth-year agricultural engineering major from Atlanta, said the curriculum now is very broad, but the small program size limits the opportunities students have outside of the classroom.
“What the program does now is give us a sort of really broad base. Many engineers who graduate from UGA work in fields where they didn’t get their degrees in,” he said. “In one sense, we’d be losing some of the breadth of our program, but in another we’d be going more in-depth in the field we actually want to work in.”
Keeney-Ritchie said if he were at the University  when the majors were implemented, assuming they get approved next week, he would “definitely” change his major to mechanical engineering, instead of pursuing a mechanical emphasis.
“I actually don’t have much of an interest in ag engineering,” he said. “Though I find it fascinating, it’s not what I really want to do.”


TNCMS.AdManager.render({region: 'fixed-big-ad-bottom-asset', slot: 1, fold: ""below""});


Tankersley, however, said he would not change his major if he had the opportunity.
“However, if I were a freshman just entering UGA, I would change my major to civil engineering,” he said. “When I say what my major is, I get, ‘Ag engineering? What’s that?’”
Had Tankersley — whose emphasis is natural resources — and Keeney-Ritchie been University students 180 years ago, they would both have had the opportunity to major in mining, mechanical, electrical or civil engineering, all of which were offered beginning in 1830 and when the University had its School of Engineering in 1880.
Agricultural and biological engineering undergraduate degrees were not added until 1929 and 1993, respectively. All other engineering programs were transferred to Georgia Tech in 1932.
“I really, really enjoy the department and the program, and I don’t think ill of it in any way,” Keeney-Ritchie said. “Our program is a lot smaller and doesn’t have the resources that Tech has. … It limits the ability of students to excel. I wish there was a UGA school of engineering already.”

14-Oct-10,Student arrested on child pornography charges (w/documents),"A University student was arrested Wednesday at about 7 p.m. and charged with sexual exploitation of a child. He was sought in connection with the discovery of child pornography on a computer he owned.Officials found three child porn photos on his computer. According to an earlier Red & Black report, University Police began investigating the case on Sept. 28 after receiving a report from  law enforcement in Minneapolis that a technical support company found the porn on his computer.University Police Chief Jimmy Williamson said all three images were of children under the age of thirteen.


 


“From the images I’ve seen, all of the photos are preteen,” Williamson said.According to Athens-Clarke County court documents, two of the images were deleted and one was found in a LimeWire folder labeled “incomplete downloads.” Williamson said none of the images were taken by the student. “If he had taken the photos, the charges would have been different. People in the U.S. who are interested in that sort of thing kind of assume that if they take the picture, they’ll go to jail,” he said. “[Law officials] found years ago that many of these images were coming from foreign countries, where we had no way to help. Law enforcement in the U.S. decided that we were indirectly helping an industry that harms children, and so we developed laws for possessing child porn as well.”Williamson said he did not know if the images originated from foreign countries.The case against the student was dismissed because the images were recovered from the deleted files on his computer, which, according to the Georgia Supreme Court, is not evidence that he was actually in possession of the images. -Editor's Note: The students name has been removed from this article due to the nature of the dismissal of his case.",Tiffany Stevens,news,https://www.redandblack.com/news/student-arrested-on-child-pornography-charges-w-documents/article_2e159951-ee44-52c5-9a93-9b68055f7170.html
18-Oct-10,Former employee will still pursue sludge suit (w/documents),"When a United States District Court Judge dismissed a lawsuit concerning a University research study, David Lewis decided to fight back.
Lewis, a former University employee and plaintiff in the suit, said he will appeal last month’s decision.
The defendants in the suit are four University researchers, Environmental Protection Agency employees and the University Research Foundation.


 


The four researchers studied the toxicity of treated sewage sludge being used as fertilizer in Augusta. They investigated the issue and analyzed soil samples, concluding that Augusta’s sewage sludge program complied with environmental laws and did not pose a significant risk to cattle.
But Lewis said the researchers’ findings weren’t entirely true.
“It was all adding up to what looked like nothing but a cover-up,” said Lewis, a University alumnus. “Not only were the studies incomplete and came to wrong conclusions... the employees who created the data admitted they had made up the numbers.”
But William Miller, a professor of soil science and one of the researchers, said otherwise.
“I do not think there was any fabricated or misleading data, to my knowledge,” he said.
The allegedly fabricated study is all the more important, Lewis said, because it was used for other purposes. The University researchers received a $12,274 grant from the EPA in connection with the study, and after its completion, the National Academy of Sciences used the data as proof that sewage sludge was safe.
Lewis said he urged the University to withdraw the data, but when it “dug its heels in,” he took legal action. Although he said it was “clear that EPA approached the University of Georgia to publish data they knew were fake,” he was “naive” and did not realize how hard it would be to win the lawsuit.
The final decision to dismiss was based on a small but important detail of the False Claims Act.


 


Lewis and the dairy farmers whose farms were treated with the sludge and who were also involved in the suit used a document they obtained through a public records request as evidence. But the FCA is only applicable if the information is not publicly disclosed or if the people suing under the FCA are the original source of the publicly disclosed information.
The lawsuit hinged on whether information obtained through a public records request could be considered original information. In most cases, courts have ruled that information obtained through an open records request is publicly disclosed. But some courts have made a distinction between information that is publicly available and publicly disclosed, and argued that open records information is not publicly disclosed.
“I thought the judge was unlikely to take the position he did, because we had a strong case,” Lewis said.
Tom Jackson, the University’s vice president for public affairs, said he could not discuss the suit because litigation is still in process.
“To this point, the University’s position has prevailed,” he said.
And though Lewis and the dairy farmers will continue to fight, it’s going to be an uphill battle.
“The truth is, the dairy farmers and I have already lost everything,” he said. “We don’t have the wherewithal to keep this legal battle up.”
The farmers lost their dairy farms and their livelihood after the sewage sludge contaminated their land.

Lewis lost his career as a scientist, as well as his personal savings, which he spent on the suit.
“I’m fighting not only for the government to get its money back... but I’m also fighting for my career and reputation,” he said. “What UGA did to me to destroy my career as a scientist — it looks like they’re going to get away scot-free.”

25-Oct-10,Dogs playing up to preseason expectations,"This was how things should have gone all along.
The pieces are all in place, the cylinders are all clicking.
Georgia football is finally living up to expectations, if only three or four losses later than supporters imagined.


 


Now, another dominant victory over an SEC opponent has left a once-unlikely question lingering: Is Georgia the best team in the SEC East?
Georgia’s 44-31 handling of the Kentucky Wildcats on Saturday certainly has the question of which team is the division’s best now up in the air — a 180-degree turnaround from being a beleaguered 1-4 squad three weeks ago. As the rest of the division’s top teams gave away wins to inferior opponents, the one-time disappointment of the entire conference has now convincingly routed three conference opponents in a row.
Perhaps this is as it should have been.
The Bulldogs approached this season with the confidence that they were going to perform at this high of a level all season long.
The offensive line was supposed to be dominant — as it was against Kentucky, paving the way for 177 yards and five scores on the ground. The passing game was supposed to be efficient — as it was against the Wildcats, completing 9-of-12 passes to keep the defense from loading eight defenders in the box. All that has happened in the past three weeks has represented what was supposed to define the 2010 season.
And all that has happened in the past three weeks has conjured up the possibility that the Georgia Bulldogs are the best team around.
Were this a normal year in the SEC East, this would be a meaningless question — one proposed by Georgia pundits with nothing better to discuss about their disappointing season. A 4-4 record, no matter the recent quality of play, would generally bury any team in such an elite division of college football.
But 2010 has not been a normal year.


 


This 4-4 record is different. Reaching .500 has the Bulldogs hoping and dreaming.
And honestly, why not?
South Carolina, who once held a commanding lead in the division, has fallen into its traditional late-season tailspin after a loss to Kentucky and outlasting an underwhelming Vanderbilt squad. Georgia would still need South Carolina to lose two more SEC games to have an opportunity at the title game, but with the Gamecocks’ upcoming games against Arkansas, Tennessee and Florida, never say never.
As for the Gainesville, Fla., bunch, times are looking bleak for the 2010 season.
Losses to Alabama, LSU and Mississippi State have the Gators reeling in one of their worst starts under Urban Meyer, and their 2-3 record in the conference has Georgia’s season looking more and more respectable.
The rest of the division? Floundering and already beaten by the Bulldogs.
Given this scenario, next week’s Florida game will indeed be a must-win for Georgia, as every SEC game will be from here on out. Mark Richt needs to find a way to keep this momentum going, whether it be continuing to execute full-contact practices or letting his players’ facial hair grow out to “Cast Away” proportions.
Whatever it takes, Georgia needs to bring home a win from Jacksonville, Fla., next weekend. This 4-3 Florida team is not playing at a high level, but never discount anything in rivalry games. The Gators will present the Bulldogs with the most athletic team they have faced in weeks, possibly the entire season.


TNCMS.AdManager.render({region: 'fixed-big-ad-bottom-asset', slot: 1, fold: ""below""});


And Florida enters this year’s version of The World’s Largest Outdoor Cocktail Party (yes, I still call it that), with a new form of motivation, one that is not a commonality in recent years — desperation.
But in spite of Florida’s athleticism or questionable reinstatements of a key skill player (i.e. Chris Rainey), the time could not be better for Richt to beat Meyer and put his team firmly back into the SEC picture. It can happen, the possibility exists.
The reason? Georgia — despite all odds — just might be the best team in the division after all.
And if fans really want a definitive answer on the issue, it will be solved in front of the nation on Saturday at EverBank Field.
Until then, here is the only surefire conclusion: Maybe.",Zach Dillard,sports,https://www.redandblack.com/sports/dogs-playing-up-to-preseason-expectations/article_0ead7efe-bfba-5354-a7ca-3ca9f4d04df5.html
17-Nov-10,Justin Houston finalist for Bronko Nagurski Trophy,"Georgia junior Justin Houston has been named one of five finalists for the Bronko Nagurski Trophy, which is given annually to the nation’s top defensive player.
Houston is one of only five finalists who have been picked from the initial Watch List of 74 players.  The annual Bronko Nagurski Trophy Banquet will be on Dec. 6 at the Westin Hotel in Charlotte, N.C., where the winner will be announced.  The Football Writers Association of America and the Charlotte Touchdown Club determine the winner and present the award.
The four other finalists include two other players from the Southeastern Conference (LSU junior CB Patrick Peterson, Auburn junior DT Nick Fairley) and a pair from the ACC (Clemson junior DE Da’Quan Bowers, Boston College sophomore LB Luke Kuechly).


 


Houston, a 6-3, 258-pound native of Statesboro, remains the SEC leader in sacks by 2.5 with 10 and is second in the league with 17.5 tackles for loss.  He is third on Georgia’s defense with 50 tackles this season.
Playing his first season at outside linebacker after lining up as defensive end his first three years, Houston has the most sacks and tackles for loss of any active SEC player and has recorded at least one tackle for loss in all 11 games this year.  He had a combined total of 10.0 sacks and 19.5 tackles for loss during the 2008 and 2009 seasons.
Houston was named the SEC Defensive Player of the Week after exploding for five tackles, including two sacks and three tackles for loss, and seven quarterback hurries while also recovering a fumble and breaking up a pass at Kentucky earlier this year.
Thanks in part of Houston’s presence, the Bulldogs have forced 20 turnovers and converted them into 80 points.  Georgia’s turnover margin (+8) leads the SEC and is tied for 18th in the nation.
Former Bulldog All-American Champ Bailey is the only Georgia player to win the Nagurski Trophy after receiving the honor in 1998.
Houston has already been named one of 15 semifinalists for the Butkus Award and one of 16 semifinalists for the Bednarik Award this season.  Both of these awards are scheduled to announce their finalists early next week.
After an off-week on Nov. 20, the Bulldogs (5-6, 3-5 SEC) host Georgia Tech (5-5, 3-4 ACC) on Nov. 27 at 7:45 p.m. Georgia’s game will be televised on ESPN, which is the second time the network has covered the Bulldogs this season.",Georgia Sports Communications,sports,https://www.redandblack.com/sports/justin-houston-finalist-for-bronko-nagurski-trophy/article_53dcf91d-8fd1-5d4a-8ee5-c11c5cdb6429.html
3-Dec-10,"Alumna publishes second book, prepares for third in spring","Jackson Pearce probably will never meet all her goals, but that doesn’t stop the University alumna from considering herself a success.
Pearce, a 2007 graduate who majored in English and minored in Philosophy, has published two books since her time in Athens: 2009’s “As You Wish” and 2010’s “Sisters Red.”
A third book is set and should be released in Spring 2011.


 


“My goal was to get a book published and that would equal success,” Pearce said. When that happened, “then the goal was to get another published, then to hit The New York Times’ best-seller list.”
Although that may not have happened — yet — Pearce is happily entertained by raising the bar for herself each time she accomplishes one of her goals.
“The moment you hit one goal there’s another one,” Pearce said. “I’m not satisfied, but I’m happy.”
Pearce has always wanted to write, a skill that is more or less the result of a life-long passion for reading.
According to Pearce’s biography -— published by HarperTeen, an imprint of publishing house HarperCollins that put out “As You Wish” -— she “began writing when she got angry that the school librarian couldn’t tell her of a book that contained a smart girl, horses, baby animals and magic. Her solution was to write the book herself when she was twelve.”
Today, Pearce does seemingly the same thing; she writes what makes her happy.
“The genre I write in is the genre I like to read,” Pearce said.
That genre is young adult, or YA, novels — a genre familiar to University students who admire J.K. Rowling’s mega-popular magical series “Harry Potter,” or Suzanne Collins’ “The Hunger Games” trilogy, Laurie Halse Anderson’s “Speak,” or the vampire-werewolf hit “Twilight” by Stephenie Meyer.


 


“[For YA books] the drama is often said to be trivial and silly,” Pearce said. “But everything is a really big deal, it’s 1,000 times stronger, when [young adults] experience something for the first time. YA books are for anyone who has ever been a teenager, who’s succeeded, failed, loved or lost a friend.”
That universalism in audience and theme is the driving force behind Pearce’s writing, but the path to publication for “As You Wish” was almost as dramatic as the topics she writes on.Pearce began her undergraduate education at Georgia College and State University in Milledgeville before she decided to transfer to the University after only one year.
“Athens is a cool, funky town and I was drawn to the marching band ---— though I ended up not doing it for very long,” Pearce said. “[What] I didn’t realize was how different English programs could be.”
Even with the change, Pearce’s aspirations to publish weren’t deterred.
“I spent my fourth year cleaning up my first manuscript to make it submission ready,” Pearce said. “I sent it in at the beginning of my fifth year and everyone rejected it.”
In response, Pearce began working on another book, completing it and submitting it during her last semester.
“I got an agent in June and sold it in the fall,” Pearce said.
Both “As You Wish” and “Sisters Red” have received very good critical success, earning starred reviews in the School Library Journal and inclusion in school and college curricula.


TNCMS.AdManager.render({region: 'fixed-big-ad-bottom-asset', slot: 1, fold: ""below""});


For University students whose hopes mirror Pearce’s own during her time in Athens, she has a bit of advice to give:
“It’s important to remember that when you receive a rejection it’s not saying that you’re a worthless artist, what it is saying is that you may be a bad business decision right now,” Pearce said. “[You need to] separate business from pleasure, books do have prices on them and the publishing industry is set up to weed out people that don’t want it enough.”
But if the want is there, and one’s skill is equal, success isn’t out of the question.
“You must be stronger than the business,” Pearce said. “Write for the love of it and not because it pays your bills.”

“It’s going to be intense. We are going to fly all over the place and make some turnovers,” said Amarlo Herrera, a 6-foot-1, 224-pound linebacker out of North Clayton High School.


 


With the departure of Justin Houston, Darryl Gamble and Akeem Dent, as well as Nick Williams and Marcus Dowtin being released from their scholarships, the 2011 linebacking corps under defensive coordinator Todd Grantham will need Herrera to help anchor the load. 
North Clayton head coach Rodney Hackney believes he can do just that.
“I think he will definitely be able to play early on. You know, he’s going to have work his butt off because the SEC is a whole new level, but I think he can do it,” Hackney said.
With the 3-4 scheme employed by Georgia and all the complicated blitzing patterns that go along with it, Hackney said he knows Herrera will have to put his nose in the playbook.
“We ran some of it [3-4 scheme] here, but it was nowhere near as complex as what Georgia’s doing,” Hackney said. “Amarlo will most definitely have to study to get it down.”
Herrera’s goals are not limited to himself — he wants to play a small part in developing a level of consistent success at the University of Georgia.
“We want to make a dynasty,” he said. “Me and the other guys coming with me want to build a dynasty. We want to win everything.”
One of the guys coming with him will be fellow linebacker and most recent Georgia commitment Ramik Wilson out of Tampa, Fla.


 


“I met Ramik this summer when he first got offered,” Herrera said. “We played together in the Offense-Defense All–American game. We roomed together there.”
Anchored by converted running back Richard Samuel and Southern California transfer Jarvis Jones, the inside linebackers will have a nice infusion of depth with the arrival of Herrera and Wilson. Herrera said the duo plans to bring the pain that’s expected from great linebackers.
“All I know is that we are going to hit some people in the mouth this year,” Herrera said.",Travis Ragsdale,sports,https://www.redandblack.com/sports/new-recruit-ready-to-hit-some-people-in-the-mouth/article_a72733f3-6573-5f72-9610-5de441f4b384.html
1-Mar-11,Fox restores belief in basketball program,"Chris Barnes never liked seeing blue.
Georgia’s senior forward never liked seeing the oranges, crimsons or purples in the stands, either.
But blue was the worst.


 


For his first two seasons in Athens, Barnes often found himself in unfamiliar territory, looking up into a crowd only to find colors different from those on his own jersey — even when the Bulldogs were playing in the friendly confines of Stegeman Coliseum.
“That was almost every game where we would look up into the stands, especially when we play people like Kentucky, we’d look up into the stands and see more blue than we see red and black,” Barnes said.
These were not the types of aesthetics Barnes had imagined when he signed his letter of intent to play for the Bulldogs.
But for many Georgia fans, attending home games at Stegeman often became an afterthought — a product of a lack of interest and, more importantly, the team’s lack of success.
Barnes and fellow senior Jeremy Price were freshmen and sophomores on Georgia teams that went a collective 7-25 in the Southeastern Conference during the 2007-08 and 2008-09 seasons. It was the tail end of a dismal stretch of games under former head coach Dennis Felton, and as a result, empty seats littered the arena when the Bulldogs played in Athens.
“I remember back freshman and sophomore year, it would be like a few games — maybe only two or three games — that the fans would come out and show us a lot of support,” Price said.
Attendance was down. The players were down. And Felton, who had compiled an 84-91 record over his six years as head coach, was on his way out.
Even an NCAA Tournament appearance in 2008 — stemming from a three-day miracle run that crowned the Bulldogs as SEC Tournament champions — could not turn the tides of the program.


 


If anything, some loyal fans believe the tournament appearance only made matters worse.
“I really think that the month before we went to the SEC Championship [in 2008] and the year after we won it were really the low point,” said Nathan Lawrence, a fifth-year senior in the basketball pep band who has attended nearly every Georgia game since the 2006-07 season. “Dennis Felton sort of bought himself another year and we just didn’t get any better.”
The University’s basketball program reached its tipping point when a Jan. 28, 2009, trip to Gainesville, Fla., yielded a lopsided 83-57 loss to the Florida Gators and sent the team to 0-5 in the SEC.
With Georgia floundering in a seven-game losing streak, Felton was relieved of his head coaching duties during the season with the team’s overall record at 9-11.
Price, Barnes and the rest of the Bulldogs played the remainder of the 2008-09 season under interim coach Pete Herrmann — finishing dead last in the SEC East. The team began looking forward to the next coach to attempt to right the ship in Athens.
The only question: Who?
‘Believe’
When former Georgia athletic director Damon Evans made the move to fire Dennis Felton on Jan. 29, 2009, rumors immediately started swirling as to who he would name as Felton’s successor.


TNCMS.AdManager.render({region: 'fixed-big-ad-bottom-asset', slot: 1, fold: ""below""});


Missouri’s Mike Anderson and Oklahoma’s Jeff Capel, two successful head coaches in the Big 12 Conference, were two popular candidates thrown out for public discussion.
Virginia Commonwealth University’s Anthony Grant, who eventually took the head job at Alabama, was another in vogue choice during that 2009 offseason.
There was even a time when coaching legend Bob Knight was being clamored for amongst the Georgia faithful.
But very few had their eyes fixated on Reno, Nev.
There, a 40-year-old basketball coach at the University of Nevada was on yet another successful campaign in the Western Athletic Conference. He had compiled five consecutive 20-win seasons in Reno, including three trips to the NCAA Tournament.
In Evans’ mind, he was just the man for the job.
“I know this is going to be a great day when we look back on the history of Georgia men’s basketball program,” Evans said in a news conference at the time Fox was hired. “Mark Fox is one of the country’s brightest up-and-coming coaches.”
But taking over a troubled team in a major conference on the other side of the country was no small task for Fox and his staff.

Georgia had not finished above fifth place in the SEC East since 2003.
The returning players were comprised of a group of talented, yet inexperienced players — led by then-rising sophomores Trey Thompkins, Dustin Ware and Travis Leslie.
And, worst of all, it was a team that had lost faith.
“We talked about the mentality in our locker room and that’s where it had to start,” Fox said. “The players’ issue was, when I first came in, they said they wish there were more people coming to the games. And I just said, ‘Listen, if you’ll play the game right that’ll bring people back before you even win. Winning will cure most of your ills.’”
The players, according to Barnes and Price, bought in immediately—even when the victories did not come.
As the two seniors had experienced before, the Bulldogs sank to the bottom of the SEC East last season. Finishing with a losing record of 14-17, Georgia did not even secure a single win on the road.
But Fox had restored the team’s passion. The team competed.
By taking down three ranked opponents in Stegeman Coliseum, en route to compiling a 12-4 record at home, the Bulldogs proved they could play with the best of teams.

And as for the losing record, Price noted that nobody promised it would be easy. The only promise was that, eventually, Fox would get the job done.
“He’s a consensus-builder. You can believe in him because he plans the work and he works the plan,” said Nevada athletic director Cary Groth, who promoted Fox to head coach of her basketball program back in 2004. “He’s filled with integrity, he does things the right way … so it’s easy to believe in him. And when you believe in a head coach or you believe in an employee, that’s 99 percent of it.”
‘Uncharted waters’
Chris Barnes has seen his fair share of red and black in his senior year.
The 6-foot-8 forward is now able to glance into the rows of Stegeman Coliseum to see sold out, Georgia-friendly crowds at home games, knowing he has been a part of the rebuilding process under Fox.
It has been exactly what he signed that letter of intent for, a far cry from his freshman and sophomore seasons.
“There’s been a lot of changes. The program has really turned the corner,” Barnes said. “Coach Fox told us from day one if we play hard and play the game good that the fans would come back. And we’ve noticed that we’ve had sold out crowds almost every night, it don’t matter who we play.”
And Fox has changed the culture of Georgia men’s basketball.

In less than two years, he has transformed the program from irrelevant to relevant, from conference afterthought to being circled on opponent’s schedules.
Georgia is 19-9 this season entering tonight’s showdown with LSU—which is coached by Fox’s close friend and former Nevada head coach Trent Johnson — and is a team teetering on the edge of an NCAA Tournament berth.
“It’s amazing when you look back on the record. Even the year Georgia went to the NCAA Tournament [in 2008], that year we were 4-12 in the league,” Georgia athletic director Greg McGarity said. “Think about going through the season 4-12 and you know that at some point in time that you’re not in the hunt, you’re not in the conversation of being on the bubble, you’re just not even in the conversation.”
Fox’s team has people talking now.
Most NCAA Tournament bracket prognosticators predict Georgia is in the postseason tournament at the moment, a feat not lost on the players, its fans or others within the athletic program. A win on Georgia’s Senior Night would not only give the Bulldogs their first non-vacated 20-win season since 1997-98, but it would help complete a slow climb back to where Barnes and Price have wanted to be since that improbable run their freshman year: the postseason.
Both seniors can taste it now, even if it was a flavor long forgotten.
“It’s about time we start feeling like this around this time of the year,” said Price, who played 23 minutes in the 2008 NCAA Tournament loss to Xavier.
“This group of seniors, if you look back on their last three years, we’re in uncharted waters. Usually this time of year, Georgia basketball has not been relevant,” McGarity added. “So now you’re seeing the dynamic of the juniors looking to the seniors and saying, ‘Hey, tell us what it’s like to be in the discussion.’ And they’ve never had that feeling before.”

But Mark Fox has.
Fox was in the discussion for years at Nevada, twice advancing to the Sweet Sixteen as a head coach or an assistant.
And Fox is in the discussion again, less than two years removed from taking over a troubled program. If there were skeptics in the beginning, as Groth said, those naysayers are long gone now.
“He’s perfect for Georgia. I think Coach Fox could turn around any program because he does it the right way, he builds consensus,” Groth said. “I think you are going to have Coach Fox for a long time, as long as you can keep him.”
After helping to build and sustain success at Nevada, Fox has found a way to establish it in Athens.
But he did not take the easy route. He did not choose the route every person agreed with.
Perhaps Fox’s team needs another win or two to cement its place in the NCAAs, but the culture has already taken a turn for the better.
Fox will be the first to admit the job is not, and may never be, entirely finished. But the 2010-11 season has helped his program take a giant leap forward.

“There’s some truth in the fact that it’s hard to stay on top, but it’s hard to get there, too,” Fox said.
Wherever “there” is, Fox has the team on its way—and in the nick of time.

3-May-11,Two UGA football coaches receive pay hike,"One place budget cuts haven't hit on the University of Georgia campus is Butts-Mehre Heritage Hall.
Documents obtained by The Red & Black show two Bulldog football coaches recently received hefty raises, this following Georgia's first losing season since 1996.
Running backs coach Bryan McClendon more than doubled his pay with a boost from $90,000 to $200,000, while wide receivers coach Tony Ball will make $200,000 from a previous $165,480. Georgia Athletic Director Greg McGarity told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution the raises were in response to offers made by other schools for the coaches' services.


 


The Bulldogs had a pair of coaches leave in the off-season, as offensive line coach Stacy Searels was hired away by Texas and Warren Belin, who coached linebackers, went to the Carolina Panthers.
Offensive line coach Will Friend and linebackers coach Kirk Olivadotti were hired to replace Searels and Belin at salaries of $200,000 and $250,000 respectively. Friend's salary is $90,000 less than Searels' was at UGA, while Olivadotti makes $60,000 more than Belin did.

14-Jul-11,Gifted Program: Private funds prop up Terry College,"In a two sentence paragraph, the dean of the Terry College of Business described how the fiscal year 2012 budget cuts will affect the college.
“The impact of reductions will be wholly offset,” reads Terry College’s impact of reductions report.
Deans were asked to submit an impact of reductions report to the provost detailing what programs will be cut and how the cuts will affect the college. While many schools and colleges submitted lengthy reports listing the elimination of programs and positions, the newest budget reductions will not hit Terry as hard.


 


“The budget cuts for the most recent year are not as severe as the ones we saw two years ago, but there is this continuing trend for reduced state funding,” said Robert Sumichrast, dean of Terry. “We really started planning for budget cuts four years ago. We knew money was going to be tight.”
Tim Burgess, senior vice president for finance and administration, said since resources are scarce, schools and colleges must consider their priorities. For Terry, it’s keeping valuable faculty.
“We have to continue to tighten our belt, eliminate anything that we believe is absolutely not critical or necessary, while at the same time hopefully focus on those things that are important such as academic quality, offering classes and keeping the buildings maintained,” Burgess said.
Terry is cutting about half a million dollars from its budget, but the college is able to make up for the loss through revenue from teaching additional courses and through professional programs which help supplement undergraduate programs. And of course, Terry relies heavily on private gifts.
“We’ve had just outstanding success with private donations to the college which have been very helpful in keeping us going,” Sumichrast said.
Private funds make up a little more than 20 percent of Terry’s budget. Last year, the college received gifts and pledges in excess of $21 million. But since many private funds are designated for a specific purpose, the college uses about $2 million per year to supplement its budget.
“We’ve got great students, great faculty and really loyal, well-placed alumni,” Sumichrast said. “And all of the constituency groups want to support the college.”
But Sumichrast said though the college has managed its cuts well, it’s eliminated several alumni services. The college produced a Terry Magazine but replaced it with an electronic version because printing it became costly.


 


Terry also eliminated a “fairly elaborate” donor recognition dinner it hosted each fall.
“We still recognize the donors because we have an event in Atlanta each spring, which actually generates revenue for the college through a fundraiser,” he said. “A lot of what we’ve been able to do is continue to provide the same kind of recognition and services to alumni and the kind of classes to students, but we’ve been able to work more efficiently.”
But Terry is not immune to the realities of the budget cuts. When the reductions first began, Terry eliminated several administrative positions, seven director positions and one of the associate dean positions in order to keep more faculty in the classroom.
“One of the other things that has happened is that we’ve increased the teaching load on some of our faculty,” Sumichrast said. “In the first year of the budget cuts, I had several faculty members volunteer to teach an extra class.”
Since FY08, Terry’s faculty base has grown from 148 to 153, but the undergraduate enrollment also increased by 327 students.
“I don’t think anybody is satisfied with the way that it’s going,” Sumichrast said. “You always want to continue to improve and offer more electives and smaller sections. One of the things I’m very concerned about is that there’s a real shortage of good business school faculty.”
Although many of Terry’s faculty have strong ties to the University, Sumichrast said professors are getting offers from other institutions.
“The faculty here haven’t received a raise in the past three years, and at some point, opportunities elsewhere are pretty strong,” he said.


TNCMS.AdManager.render({region: 'fixed-big-ad-bottom-asset', slot: 1, fold: ""below""});


As for the future?
Sumichrast has faith in Terry’s robust alumni support base.
“While I am nervous particularly about the lack of raises for faculty and staff over the past three years, I think we’re going to be well-supported by the alumni,” he said. “I think over time, UGA and the Terry College will continue to improve even though this is a pretty rough patch that we’re going through.”

20-Aug-11,British songstress finds 'so much enthusiasm' in America,"For Georgina Callaghan, Atlanta was a place of destiny.
What would be inconceivable for some — to move half way across the world to chase a dream — was only natural for the British singer.
""America had always been a place I wanted to come spend time in and play music in,"" she said. ""There is such a massive market over here and so much enthusiasm for the music that I do.""


 


Callaghan has in a short time gained much recognition. So far she has performed in 21 states and has an upcoming album, entitled ""Life in Full Colour,"" which is available at live shows until its full release.
""I have been here a little over a year now and I have been enjoying getting to see the U.S., play in those fantastic venues and travel around,"" she said. ""It's been really great fun.""
Having achieved success in the United Kingdom — including airplay on BBC 2 — Callaghan came to the states to work with Atlanta-artist Shawn Mullins.
""It was really good just seeing [Mullins] work,” she said. “The way that he produces and just enjoying the process of reaching the point of having a finished product I'm really proud of. I want to get [the album] out as soon as possible.""
The decision to move from Britain to Georgia was difficult, but was completely worth it.
""It was hard to leave friends and family behind, and I had lived there for the past 10 years so it was kind of strange, but there are so many opportunities over here in the U.S. and it's such a massive adventure,"" Callaghan said. ""There's only a certain time in your life where you have the opportunity like this, and I didn't want to think a few years down the line 'What would of happened had I moved to America?'""
Callaghan started writing when she was 14 years old. In the years since, she has developed a sound that fuses Americana, folk, pop and elements of country music—which she presently performs solo, using a guitar and a piano.
A pre-release of her new CD came out in June. The official release will occur later in the year, though no official date has been set.


 


""It takes time and for a good reason, if you want the best product,"" Callaghan said.
Though she has been in Atlanta for over a year, Callaghan does not plan on leaving yet.  In fact, she plans on staying for quite a while.
""I feel like my time here is just beginning,"" she said. ""There's still so much I want to see.""
The first single off the album, ""Best Year,"" details her time in the States.
""[It] really sums up the journey over to America and that whole idea of taking a risk and following a dream,"" Callaghan said. ""Sometimes it can really pay off.”

7-Sep-11,FOOTBALL NOTEBOOK: Richt: offensive line 'better get it going',"The Bulldogs practiced in full pads Wednesday, rather than their normal Wednesday gear of helmets and shells.
Head coach Mark Richt was trying to get his team ready for Saturday’s big home matchup with No. 12 South Carolina, but ended up disappointed in the way his team closed out practice.
“Practice started out pretty good, kind of fizzled at the end of the day,” Richt said. “[Tuesday] I really loved it, today wasn’t quite as exciting. I’m sure I’ll look at the film and feel a little bit better … There’s always tomorrow. At least we didn’t play today.”


 


The most disappointing aspect during the practice for Richt was the third down pass protection, which was also a problem in last weekend’s Boise State game.
“Our boys better get it going or Aaron’s going to be on his back,” Richt said.
Left guard Kenarious Gates left the Boise game with an ankle injury and sophomore Dallas Lee did a good job replacing him. Lee will start Saturday’s game, according to Richt.
Richt little to say on Texas A&M to SEC move
There is much talk about Texas A&M’s potential move to the SEC.
After Wednesday’s practice, Mark Richt joked with reporters: “How about Texas A&M? What do y’all think about that?”
Richt does not know many details about the move, as he is staying focused on getting his team ready for Saturday.
“As honestly as I can say it,” Richt said, “I’m trying to get first downs, and touchdowns, and red zone stops. And I’m really not worried about it right now. If there’s
changes on the way, it’s going to be awhile before all the dust settles and when it does they’ll tell me who we’re going to play and then we’ll play them.”
Ogletree’s replacement still undecided
As of Wednesday night, no decision had been made on Alec Ogletree’s replacement.
When the sophomore inside linebacker left Saturday’s game with a broken foot, senior Jeremy Sulek and freshman Amarlo Herrera split his responsibilities.
Ogletree was one of the Bulldogs’ top linebackers but he will be sidelined for four to six weeks, according to Richt, after he had surgery on his foot.
Sulek, Herrera and junior Michael Gilliard are competing for the opportunity to start alongside junior Christian Robinson at inside linebacker.

8-Sep-11,Take time to remember the fallen,"We all know where we were. We know what we were doing. We remember how it made us feel. And as the days, weeks and months passed after Sept. 11, 2001, we let those feelings leave us as we went on with our lives. But this week is the time to ask ourselves to bring those sentiments back, to allow them to fill us with pride for our country and sadness for those who lost their lives.
People say we have recovered, and on the surface that may be true. I don’t walk around crying for those who died; I don’t think of those fighting terrorism overseas throughout my day. But show me a video of those plane crashes, and I still tear up.
How can you live with doing nothing this week? The United States of America has given us all something. For most of us, it has been our home for our entire live. For others, it has at least provided you with a school to attend. It deserves our support and respect for that. I don’t pledge my allegiance to a life of complacency and ignorance; I pledge my allegiance to one indivisible nation.


 


And if there was ever a time for us to be indivisible, it is now.
How can we call ourselves Americans if we cannot stand up for those lost souls and dedicated soldiers on Sept. 11th? On the anniversary of such a tragedy, I challenge you to remember how they felt when nearly 3,000 Americans were taken from us. I challenge you to appreciate the sacrifices that have been made on your behalf. Many organizations on campus are working hard to commemorate that horrible day, and there are a lot of little things that can be done to contribute.
Stop by Tate plaza and write a letter to a soldier or firefighter. Wear red this Friday in reverence for those who lost their lives. Take a moment to think of the fallen when the chapel bell rings on Sunday. We owe it to them and to this country to keep them in our thoughts this weekend.
Most of our daily lives didn’t drastically change when those towers fell. But get on the Internet and watch them fall again. Doesn’t watching them collapse change how you feel?
Be real. Show the military how you feel. Show civil servants how you feel. Show the United States of America how you feel. Be vulnerable just this once, because this country matters. Don’t be afraid to remember.

19-Oct-11,University must phase out coal plant,"There’s something happening on campus even worse than the lump of coal that Santa might leave in your stocking this year. A pile of coal. No. A building of coal. And, you get it whether you’ve been naughty or nice.
The University’s coal-fired plant burns 500 tons of coal every week, according to its operational staff. This coal does not provide electricity but produces steam that is used to heat the dorms and other buildings on campus. That the coal is used for steam rather than electricity does not negate the harmful effects of the plant. Coal burned is coal burned. The coal boiler is 46-years-old and nearing the end of its operational life, so the burner is only able to run four to five months out of the year.
Burning coal releases toxins into our community, creating significant health hazards and health care costs for students on campus. Coal emissions are a leading cause of high mercury levels in the atmosphere, and one in six women in the United States have enough mercury in their bodies to lead to birth defects if they become pregnant, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. And living within 10 miles of a coal plant can increase the risk of asthma and asthma attacks by as much as 50 percent.


 


Not only does coal have the potential to eventually deplete citizen’s health, it is also placing an explicit financial burden on the University. Data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration shows that as the price of coal continues to increase, solar and other renewable energy sources are becoming more cost-effective. Both the health costs and financial costs of coal make this a real issue with devastating impacts on the University and the Athens community.
Although there is no immediate opportunity to revamp the University’s relationships with energy providers off campus, we can begin to act for change on our campus. The measures by which the University can retire the outdated plant on campus can be set in motion soon. We can begin by urging University President Michael Adams to create a task force of students, faculty, administrators and operational staff to start planning for a cleaner, more renewable energy solution for the University and set a date to retire the coal plant.
Sure, moving forward will be a long and complicated process, and I lack the expertise to suggest a comprehensive and viable alternative. However, if the University devotes its leading research minds to finding an energy solution, it will be able to come up with something both clean and cost effective.
As a student of this University, I want to be able to walk to class without breathing in toxins from a plant in the middle of campus. Our University can begin by setting a date to retire our coal boiler — a step that has already been taken by Clemson, Penn State and the University of North Carolina, among others.
The retiring of the coal plant will be a monumental achievement for the University as well as the state of Georgia. The University is a flagship university of the southeast, and by retiring the plant, it will be demonstrating its commitment to using cutting edge research capabilities to lead the state toward a cleaner future. As students, we should be proud of our status as members of such an influential institution, and we must capitalize on all opportunities for environmental leadership. Though retiring our coal boiler would not take the University completely off the grid of coal power, it would be a significant step forward in easing the state into 21st century energy solutions.

The University’s service efforts extend to small-town governments as well as to business and agricultural industries across the state.
The Office of Public Service and Outreach is the formally designated coordinator of such service and outreach programs.


 


“We’re able to bring the resources of the University to help meet needs and solve problems throughout the state,” said Joycelyn Trigg, director of communication for the Office of Public Service and Outreach.
As a land and sea grant institution, the University has had an obligation to serve the people of the land under the Moral Act of 1862.
The office is divided into eight units: the Archway Partnership, Carl Vinson Institute of Government, Fanning Institute, Georgia Center for Continuing Education, Office of Service-Learning, the Small Business Development Center, and the State Botanical Garden of Georgia.
Traditionally, the University focused on agricultural research and development in the state.
Today the Carl Vinson Institute works with local governments struggling to effectively adjust to shrinking budgets.
The Marine Extension Service works to research and promotes marine inudstries and public awareness of the marine world.
The Office of Service Learning often works with faculty and students to develop service projects and research applications.
Trigg said there are many opportunities for students to get involved who would like to persue a career in public service or simply to make connections with their classroom and the real world.


 


The Office of Service Learning also offers classes for students in which they may develop service projects that bring students into local classrooms or give experience to veterinary students.
“I think that it’s becoming more and more important that people understand what we do and who we are,” Trigg said. “As the University of Georgia, we also have a commitment to the rest of the state. It’s not limited to campus.”",Rachel G.

24-Oct-11,FOOTBALL NOTEBOOK: Off week welcomed by 'cranky' Bulldogs,"The verdict was unanimous.
Despite being in the midst of a five-game win streak, Georgia football players and coaches were in agreement — having a bye last week was exactly what the Bulldogs needed.
""We all needed it,"" Georgia head coach Mark Richt said. ""You've got camp and you've got seven games, and I think everybody was tired. I think everybody was a little cranky... That may have added to what happened at the end of the [Vanderbilt] game, quite frankly. If you're a little sleep-deprived, you feel worn out, you're tired and beat up, sometimes that can affect you.""


 


Center Ben Jones was also pleased the off week fell when it did.
""We definitely needed the bye week,"" he said. ""We've been grinding since the first week of August and all through June and July with workouts, so that was very nice for us to get a week off. We practiced a couple of times to get our legs back under us, and I know toward the end of the [Vanderbilt] game, our legs were dead. You're going 70, 80 snaps a game with really no subs, and that week was very nice to have as an o-linemen.""
The offense was not the only side happy with the respite, though.
Freshman linebacker Ray Drew could tell his teammates were itching for a break.
""I think everyone was getting ready to go crazy,"" he said. ""You can only take so much football. The passion that everyone has for the team and for football in general, guys need to keep their drive to keep going. With our schedules and what you have to endure, you have to be crazy just to have that type of love for the game in order to do it.""
With their weekend less hectic than usual, some were able to take advantage of the extra downtime, as Richt headed to Mars Hill, N.C. on Saturday to watch his son John take the field.
John is the starting quarterback at Mars Hill College, leading the Lions to a 6-2 overall record thus far in 2011.
Richt also watched his second-oldest son, David, who plays in several Christian rock bands, perform in the ""Jan Smith Student Showcase"" Sunday in Decatur.


 


Richt was not the only one who capitalized on his free time, however, as linebacker Christian Robinson went home to relax and watch football with his family.
To Robinson, the bye week had no negatives, and dismissed that it would disrupt the momentum of the Bulldogs' five-game win streak.
""I don't think the momentum is broke,"" he said. ""I think it was the rest we needed to continue the excitement and continue what we've been doing.""
Bulldogs begin preparations for Florida in full pads
Georgia wasted no time getting back into the swing of things at Monday's practice, donning full pads in a two-hour workout.
""After the open date, we get far enough ahead where we can practice as if it is a Tuesday, so we were in full pads today and we’ll be in shells tomorrow like we would be on a normal Wednesday,"" Richt told Georgia Sports Communications. ""Then we’ll basically have two dress rehearsals, one on Wednesday and one on Thursday. Those two practices will look a lot like Thursday practices for us.""
Richt said that he wanted to get all of the ""physical work out of the way"" early in the week so the team can be ""fresh and ready to hit"" when the Bulldogs arrive in Jacksonville for Saturday's date with the Gators.
The captains for Saturday's game will be defensive ends Abry Jones and DeAngelo Tyson, offensive tackle Cordy Glenn and center Ben Jones.

31-Oct-11,Krueger unable to defend her title; men's cross country notches best SEC finish since 2004,"Georgia traveled to Maryville, Tenn., on Halloween for the 2011 SEC Cross Country Championships, and the men's squad came away with its highest finish since 2004.
Both the men and women finished in the top-five at third and fourth, respectively.
In the women’s 6k race, defending individual champion Kristi Krueger led the charge for the Lady Bulldogs, but did not retain her title, finishing in sixth place at 20:40.45. But with a top-ten finish, Krueger was named to her second consecutive All-SEC First-Team.


 


“Nobody thinks twice about All-SEC First Team. Obviously, you want to repeat, but she did a great job in spite of not running a step last week.” head coach Jeff Pigg said.
In the men’s 8 kilometer race, Junior Matt Cleaver led the way for the Bulldogs finishing eight, adding another top-ten finish to his resume. Sophomore Brandon Lord rounded out the top ten, finishing just three seconds behind Cleaver. Brett Richardson made for three Bulldogs in the top 15 with a time of 24:49.31.
All of Georgia’s scorers broke the top 20 with sophomore Luke Baker and Junior Brian Detweiler finishing back-to-back at 17th and 18th. In addition to the scorers, the final two Bulldogs — seniors Nick Long and JP Hackney — still finished in the top 26.
“Our top seven all did a fabulous job. When you have all of your runners in the top 26, it really shows the depth our team has,” Pigg said.
Those were not the only accolades of the morning as Brendan Hoban earned SEC All-Freshman honors with a time of 25:37.
The Bulldogs scored a total of 68 points, just two points behind rival Florida. Defending champion and the pre-race favorite Arkansas retained its crown with 33 points.
“Getting beat by two points to Florida, well… it is close. It makes you think back to what you could have done. We’ll get another opportunity in two weeks and we are definitely looking forward to that,” Pigg said.
While the men posted their best finish in seven years, the Lady Dogs secured their best finish since 2006 with junior Ashley Shiver crossing the finish line next after Krueger with a time of 21:26.41 — good for 22nd place. The Lady Bulldogs scored 124 points on the day, finishing ahead of Ole Miss for the 4th spot.


 


The Lady Bulldogs final three finishing scores came from freshman Anna Bowles (27th-21:35.65), junior Leslie Boozer (34th-21:49.22), and senior Abbie Robinson (38th-21:54.46).
Vanderbilt scored 30 points as the top women’s team. Arkansas, and Florida finished second and third.
After a good showing at the SEC Championships, Georgia will head back to Harry Pritchett Running Park in Tuscaloosa, Ala., at the NCAA South Regional Championships on Nov. 12th.
“Third and fourth [place] is solid. I like the direction we’re headed,"" Pigg said.

3-Nov-11,Band brings videogame sounds to life onstage: ‘it’s a total multimedia experience’,"Bit Brigade literally plays its music.
For gamer Noah McCarthy, his instrument is a Nintendo controller, which he uses to fly through an entire game on-stage in less than an hour — and all the time, the brigade plays along
“What we do is a live, real-time performance of the score of a video game as it’s being played by someone,” said guitarist Jace Bartet. “People really don’t get what Bit Brigade is until they see it for themselves.”


 


The live-action game is projected on stage for everyone to watch as the band furiously plays along.
“Once Noah pushes ‘power on’ on the Nintendo, that’s it,” Bartet said. “It’s a roller coaster ride we can’t get off.”
And once the ride starts, the music’s fate is in McCarthy’s hands.
He’s never gotten a game over while playing with the band, but occasional mess-ups do happen, once dying during “Ninja Gaiden” at a music and gaming festival.
“Noah is a world-class gamer. I’d never seen him die in a practice or show until MAGfest 9,” Bartet said. “When he died, we didn’t really know what to do. We were like, ‘Whaaaaat’ so he just started the level over.”
But that death ultimately worked in the band’s favor, drawing in a crowd of over 600 people.
“A lot of people then realized there was someone playing the game,” Bartet said. “It gave the whole rest of the performance way more suspense for people who were watching.”
Though he said the live gaming makes performances “really stressful,” it’s an entertaining concept that’s uncommon even within the videogame music genre, which includes groups like Japanese band The Black Mages.


 


“We like exposing it in the context of the game because that’s how most people have experienced the music: first-hand,” Bartet said.
In Mega Man, known in Japan as Rockman, the game’s imagery is as vital as the music is for creating its rock ‘n’ roll feel.
“Each tune visually matches the visual look of the levels,” Bartet said. “They collaborate in this weird, visual way.”
But while many in the genre are playing jazz or metal versions of the music, Bit Brigade strives to stay true to the original tunes.
“What we do really pays tribute to the music by staying as close to the original compositions as we can,” Bartet said.
Staying true, however, comes with its own challenges: the composer of “Contra” wrote all of the game’s music on a computer.
“We’re trying to make the music a rock band reality that wasn’t composed on rock instruments,” Bartet said. “So we have to figure out a lot of shortcuts and cheats.”
Returning to Caledonia, where the band first played more than six years ago, the brigade will be performing “Mega Man 2,” in which the sense of “rock ‘n’ roll was fully realized,” Bartet said.

7-Nov-11,"Razorbacks answer Bulldogs' prayers, puts Georgia back in control of own destiny in SEC East","The Georgia Bulldogs are one of the most openly religious teams in college football, led by Mark Richt, their devoutly Christian head coach.
Since their 45-42 defeat to South Carolina on Sep. 10, the Bulldogs have been doing a lot of praying, needing a Gamecocks' loss to regain control of their own destiny in the SEC East race.
Saturday night in Fayetteville, Ark., Georgia's prayers were answered, as the Arkansas Razorbacks beat the Gamecocks 44-28.


 


That was really the only game that mattered to the Bulldogs on Saturday, anyway.
Few thought the Bulldogs would have many problems against the New Mexico State Aggies, despite four of their running backs — Isaiah Crowell, Richard Samuel, Carlton Thomas and Ken Malcome — unavailable to play.
Even without its quartet of running backs, Georgia put the game away early, heading into the locker room ahead 49-3 at halftime and eventually winning 63-16.
After the game, the only thing on the players' minds was watching more football, but not just the Razorbacks and the Gamecocks.
""I'm definitely focusing on Arkansas and South Carolina, but Alabama/LSU, that's a game you can't miss, so I'll be tuned in to both,"" running back Brandon Harton said.
Another Brandon said he would do the same thing.
""I'm gonna be flipping back and forth between both of them, probably eating something, kicking back on the couch,"" cornerback Brandon Boykin said. ""Hopefully we can be atop at the SEC East after it.""
And that is exactly where the Bulldogs find themselves now — in first place in the Eastern Division.


 


Richt watched the final seconds tick off the clock of the Razorbacks' victory with his wife, but didn't seem as enthused as one might think.
Whether one wants to believe his lack of excitement is open for debate, of course.
""My wife and I were kind of just sitting side by side on the couch and it was just us and I think we both were kind of tired,"" he said. ""We were awake and we were interested but we didn't jump up or dance or anything, but we were very happy.""
Georgia's players undoubtedly felt the same way — and dancing for joy may or may not have been involved.
With South Carolina's loss, they know what they have to do for the rest of the season.
""Do what you can do and work hard to prepare for the next team, not look ahead,"" running back Kyle Karempelis said. ""It's a big deal next week, so we've gotta focus on that and nobody else.""
""Big deal"" is an understatement, though.
This Saturday's game against Auburn will be the biggest and most important game to be contested in Sanford Stadium in years, between either Georgia/LSU in 2009 or Georgia/Alabama in 2008.


TNCMS.AdManager.render({region: 'fixed-big-ad-bottom-asset', slot: 1, fold: ""below""});


The common thread between those two games?
Both ended in losses to ranked foes from the SEC West for Georgia.
Let the record show that Auburn will also carry a ranking with it when the Tigers arrive in Athens this Saturday.
For Georgia, the stakes of Saturday's game are easy to discern.
Win, and Georgia has all but clinched a spot in the SEC Championship, just needing a win over a Kentucky team that is 1-4 in conference play so far this season at home on Nov. 19.
Lose, and the Bulldogs will be back into the same position as they have been for much of the year — hoping for another South Carolina loss.
More praying will take place, too.
Those prayers from the Bulldogs and their fans will be lifted up in the name of the Florida Gators, the Gamecocks' opponent this Saturday in Columbia, a safety measure in case the Bulldogs trip up and lose to the Tigers.

And at least in this one, solitary instance, it won't be sacrilegious for the Bulldogs' faithful to wholeheartedly root for the Gators.

9-Nov-11,Georgia making 2013 defensive lineman Kelsey Griffin an early priority,"In order to keep progressing on the national level, the Georgia Bulldogs need to continue to recruit stand out defensive line prospects to increase their chances at winning a national title.
Known as a “line-of-scrimmage” league by coaches, commentators and casual fans, the Southeastern Conference has benefited greatly from having bigger, stronger and more athletic defensive lineman than any other conference in the nation.
Typically, if a team wins in the trenches, the game usually follows suit.


 


Six scholarship defensive lineman are slated to return next season for the Bulldogs, but five of those six are upperclassmen.
That makes the classes of 2012 and 2013 crucial in picking up commitments along the defensive line for the future of the program. Currently, the Bulldogs have done their part for 2012, with four defensive lineman currently committed.
But what about 2013?
Enter Kelsey Griffin, who's likely to be one of the top defensive lineman in Georgia next year.
Griffin is a 6-foot-2, 280-pound athletic freak out of Hoschton, which is roughly 30 miles northwest of Athens.
He has been timed as low as a 4.8 in the forty-yard dash, had 96 tackles and six sacks as a sophomore, and estimates he had 70 to 80 tackles in his junior season, which led his team.
College programs have taken notice of Griffin's rare abilities, as he has garnered offers from the likes of Auburn, Georgia, Georgia Tech and South Carolina thus far.
Georgia is making Griffin an early priority next year, something not too many prospects can currently say.
“I talk with the Georgia coaches as often as I can, they come down and see me a lot, so I think that’s very helpful in seeing that they want me to come,” Griffin said. “I talk to Coach (Bryan) McClendon mainly, and the defensive line coach (Rodney Garner). I talk with them as much as I can, but with football season I haven’t had the chance to talk with them a lot. Now that the season is over I plan to talk with the coaches a lot more, and getting in touch with the schools I’m really interested in.”
The Georgia coaches have left quite an impression on Griffin early in the process.
“They talk with me about how my season is going, and how school is going, because they are really worried about me progressing in school, and progressing on the field, and being a leader. So they really talk about me and my ways more than me coming to their school,” Griffin said. “I think they’re great coaches and great people. They are all good people down there.”
He has taken notice of the way the Bulldogs have played so far this season, including a seven-game winning streak after beginning the season with two consecutive losses.
“O, this team this year is doing way better than the past seasons,” Griffin said. “I think this year Georgia has definitely progressed as a football team, and overall they’ve done great. The way they bounce back, I see how the season was going at first and how they came back and still progressed, that means they have motivation and never stop — I like that.”
Griffin has particularly taken notice of defensive coordinator Todd Grantham's defense.
“The defense looks great, they've stepped it up,” Griffin said. “That’s all I hear from Georgia fans, how the defense has stepped it up. I like the offense a lot, too. They’re really good, but I think as a whole they are both doing good, and if they keep it up, they’ll end with a great season.”
Despite the early interest in Georgia, Griffin is far from naming any schools that stand out.
“I haven’t really sat down and thought about that, I’m interested in all schools right now,” Griffin said. “I never really had a college team, like that one school I always wanted to go to, so all offers are honestly wanted, but there are no offers I specifically want or need, everything is fair game right now.”",Justin Johnson,sports,https://www.redandblack.com/sports/football/georgia-making-defensive-lineman-kelsey-griffin-an-early-priority/article_376f6288-f7a9-53a7-9a2f-6aee03d2dd08.html
10-Nov-11,Occupy movement not in sync with American way,"I am part of the 99 percent, and I find the Occupy Wall Street movement to be insulting. We all share the same rights in this country. Everyone, from the richest person on Wall Street to a homeless person in Athens, gets one vote on Election Day, has a right to bear arms and the right to own property. Because of this, we should all contribute an equal percentage of our incomes no matter the amount we earn.
But the Occupy movement is not in sync with this.
I earn around $50 dollars a week. Some of you reading this probably make more than I do. By the logic of the Occupy protesters, I deserve some of what you’ve earned, because I have less. Does that sound fair?


 


No, but that’s what the Occupy protesters are asking. The one percent doesn’t owe anything to us. If its members choose to give to the less fortunate, that’s their prerogative, but requiring generosity is unfair. They’ve worked for the money they have. They shouldn’t be required to give it up simply because others have less. And I have no desire to take anything from someone else’s pocket just because their pocket is more full.
We live in the land where all men are created equal, and I don’t want to be treated as a subordinate or charity case because I don’t make billions of dollars a year. I have enough respect for myself to want to make my own way in the world, rather than take from those who have already found success. If you believe in the equality that this country was founded on, how can you demand a higher percentage of contribution from specific groups?
We all have the potential to become a part of the one percent if that is our goal. There are certainly fields that probably can’t get us there, but if being in the one percent is what we want, there are plenty of business schools and law schools at our disposal as long as we are willing to work hard and persevere.
I’m sure there are some greedy people in the one percent. But greed is a character flaw, not a legal issue. And if they’ve earned what they have, then it is theirs to keep if they so choose. Protests aren’t going to change people’s personalities or willingness to give.
And if we’re being really honest with ourselves, most of us have more than we need. Compared to most of the world, we are the one percent. Does this mean we should be required to give a higher percentage of our money to places around the globe that need it more than us? Probably not. Why is the one percent of this country any different?
Unequal wealth distribution is an issue that all countries face. But if you want everyone have the same amount, feel free to move to a communist country.
This is America, and we were founded on equality. Stand up for that equality, not a forced handout.

15-Nov-11,Vision Video will outlast Redbox and Netflix,"It’s Friday night in Athens. I’m dressed in my best pair of Champion sweatpants with the bleach stain on the rear. As I head to my dilapidated, but beloved video rental store on Broad Street, I’m nervous.
It’s been a while. Vision Video has never been one to pass judgment, but maybe it’s not ready to forgive my extended absence, or worse. Maybe it won’t remember me at all. After all, I was temporarily distracted by those strikingly handsome, but deceiving other suitors — Redbox and Netflix.
Vision Video has been providing movie rentals for the Athens community since 1986. “We’re for movie lovers,” said Jeremy Long, 39, manager of the Broad Street location. “We’re a place you can talk movies and rent movies.”  It would seem a struggle for Vision Video to stay competitive in today’s world of movie kiosks, mail-order DVDs and online television and video streaming. However, a closer look at the individualistic and customer-oriented services of Vision Video reveals the company has less to worry about than expected.


 


More than 68 percent of the U.S. population lives within a five-minute drive of a Redbox kiosk, which can be found outside of supermarkets, drug stores and other convenient spots around the country, according to redbox.com.
But with three locations scattered around town, it’s likely a Vision Video is just as close. You can avoid the long Redbox lines that always seem to form around the 9 p.m. due time-when it’s raining.
Netflix appears to be the most convenient choice as you either have your DVD shipped right to your door or enjoy online viewing instantaneously. But convenience is in the eye of the renter. “People pay tons for one movie that sits in their house, because they don’t want to go through the mailing hassle,” said Long.
In regards to streaming, “Netflix has some strange problems,” Long said. People come in to Vision Video complaining that the streaming won’t buffer, their computer’s picture quality is poor, their television hookup goes out of order or about a multitude of other issues that interrupt their viewing experience. The point of a movie is to relax and get away. Who wants a distraction from his distraction?
Selection availability is bragged about by both competitors. Featuring up to 200 titles and 630 discs, Redbox website calls its kiosks “fully automated video rental stores contained in 12-square feet of retail space.” Netflix had nearly 32,000 selections in its Internet streaming library last month and 100,000 DVD selections, according to an Associated Press article.
But Redbox only offers new releases and very few popular titles from years past.
“They’re not even competition,” said Long. “They’re not even in the same business. What they have, we have first.” Vision Video receives new releases 28 days before either Redbox or Netflix.
“People still come with their Netflix accounts because we fill in the gaps,” said Long as he checked out a gentleman who’d just admitted to renting films he couldn’t find on Netflix.


 


Some dated films that line the shelves of Vision Video are also likely never to be available for Netflix streaming due to high conversion costs as a result of the older filming techniques. July’s price increase for combination Internet streaming and DVD service also resulted in failed streaming negotiations as Netflix lost 810,000 subscribers and 50 percent stock value, according to the New York Times Third Quarter Report. “Netflix is diminishing what they can carry which is helping nowadays,” said Long.
Cost is the biggest contingent in most people’s choice of movie providers. Redbox may only charge a dollar, but Vision Video offers new releases a month earlier, for four days longer and less than $2 more. Nexflix’s services rose to $16 a month from $10, angering customers and making it a little more difficult to watch enough content to justify the price. All this time, Vision Video has been offering five movies for seven days for only $5 on any non-new releases.
And there’s the simple matter of customer satisfaction. Netflix announced a price increase in July, a dichotomy of its DVD and streaming services in September, a retraction of the plan for Qwikster, the DVD-only business three weeks later and, then, numerous apologies for the company’s conduct into the month of October, according to the Netflix Blog.  It’s not hard to empathize with subscribers’ frustrations.  “Netflix keeps burning bridges; we keep picking up the slack,” Long said.
“I guess if the post office goes under, there will be a renaissance,” Long said. But ultimately he said Vision Video doesn’t foresee any major changes. Netflix did seem to hurt at first, but people quickly came back opting to use both services.  “We’re still profitable, because it’s all about customer service and loyalty,” Long said. “You can’t really talk movies online. It turns into someone trying to sell you shoes or exchanging of swear words. We’re a club with no event. People still come in here and stay for hours.”
So on Friday night I was welcomed by the walls covered with handwriting. I felt no condemnation as I flipped through “The 1,001 Greatest Movies to See Before You Die” and eavesdropped on the heated conversation about cult films behind me. I’ve decided I prefer strolling aisles to scrolling pages and a friendly smile to a big red button. Tradition that is still aware and adaptable does stand a chance against technology. That’s my Vision for the future.

16-Nov-11,FOOTBALL NOTEBOOK: Crowell continuing to fight nagging injuries,"Isaiah Crowell said he has always been ""mainly healthy"" since he first began playing football.
That has not been the case during his freshman season at Georgia, which has seen him battle a slew of small nicks — whether it be to his groin, his wrist, his ribs or his shin.
He then arrived late to Tuesday's practice because he had to get treatment done to his knee, a minor issue in his mind.


 


""It was nothing big,"" he said.
Through it all, Crowell said dealing with the ailments has made him a better player, forcing him to improve his conditioning and making him learn to fight through the pain.
""I think I'm learning to do [battle through it] more,"" he said. ""Staying in the game is something I haven't been doing well, but I'm just going to try to continue to do my best. I want to stay in the game as much as I can.""
It showed last week against Auburn, as Crowell posted his first 100-yard  rushing performance since the Mississippi State game on Oct. 1. and scored his first rushing touchdown since Oct. 15 against Tennessee.
""I know me and CT [Carlton Thomas] were doing good, running the ball well,"" he said. ""The coaches told us that we needed to run with a purpose, and that's what we did.""
Bulldogs conduct walk-through, lift weights
Georgia switched up its normal weekly practice routine by moving indoors and performing a split-squad workout instead.
""I was watching practice yesterday, and I thought the guys were fighting hard but they just looked tired to me,"" Bulldogs coach Mark Richt said. ""So as I looked at the forecast and it said it was about 100 percent chance for rain, so I was thinking, 'You know what? It might be a good day to go ahead and practice inside.'""


 


Richt then ticked off the things that factored into his decision.
""I did it for a few reasons,"" he said. ""One,  I want their legs to be fresh [on Saturday], and we got a good lifting cycle in today instead of tomorrow, which is kinda nice to get your lift in a little sooner in the week. If we did more 11-on-11 work on Wednesdays, you'd get somebody hurt in practice and we're a little thin at some spots. I didn't want to add to that.""
The Bulldogs held a special teams meeting first, and then the offense did work in the multi-purpose room while the defense held its own meetings, a film study and a weightlifting session. Then, the two sides of the ball flip-flopped responsibilities.
Since the team has had only one day off for weather this season, Richt felt Wednesday would be ""a good day to work on the game plan"" for Saturday's matchup with Kentucky, a team that Georgia is 3-2 against in its last five meetings.
""We've had our struggles with them,"" Richt said. ""...The last time we were here, we lost to them. We've had many of them kind of go down to the wire, so any time we play Kentucky we know they're good enough to beat us.""
Regardless of the fact the Bulldogs have the opportunity to win the SEC Eastern Division on Saturday, it also holds significance for another reason altogether.
""I know our seniors are excited about the fact we're playing for a shot at the SEC Championship, but it hits all senior classes when they can't believe it's the last time they'll be playing between the hedges,"" Richt said. ""... I don't think that ever changes.""

Defensive tackle Kwame Geathers should be available to play against the Wildcats, according to Richt.
Meanwhile, cornerback Jordan Love is unlikely to play this Saturday and could also be sidelined for next week's season finale against Georgia Tech.
Love broke his hand last Saturday in Georgia's victory over Auburn.",Ryan Black,sports,https://www.redandblack.com/sports/football-notebook-crowell-continuing-to-fight-nagging-injuries/article_cd27c2db-fa23-5ed8-9839-c15a0394a086.html
17-Nov-11,Freshman wide receiver Conley worked his way out of redshirting,"Utter the phrase “hard worker,” and Chris Conley’s name is likely not far behind.
Whether it’s head coach Mark Richt, wide receivers coach Tony Ball or his teammates, all have taken note of the outstanding work ethic of the true freshman wideout.
“That’s the first thing I noticed about him when he got here in the summer,” linebacker Cornelius Washington said. “[It] was how fast he tried to get into a working position. He wanted to show guys he was going to pull his own weight.”


 


Conley has more than pulled his own weight recently, ranking as the team’s sixth-leading receiver with 10 receptions for 189 yards.
The lionshare of his production came in a breakout performance against New Mexico State two weeks ago, where he led the Bulldogs with 5 receptions and 126 receiving yards, which included a 47-yard touchdown catch.
Just five years ago, though, he had never played the sport in his life.
Influenced by those around him, Conley decided to give football a try in his freshman year at North Paulding High School in Dallas.
The only problem was, he knew nothing about the game.
“I didn’t even know what the positions were, so I couldn’t really ask anything,” he said. “I didn’t know the rules of football. I knew ‘touchdown’ and ‘interception.’ That was about it.”
Playing both ways — at wide receiver and linebacker, respectively — Conley admits he wasn’t good at either position.
During the summer between his freshman and sophomore years, though, things changed, after he remembered a word of advice from his mother.


 


“My mom would always tell me, ‘Do everything as unto Christ,’ and that really pushed me,” he said. “If I’m going to do something, I’m gonna be the best I can at it, even if the best I can is not really good. That pushed me just to work. “
With that newfound mindset, he approached his head coach, Heath Webb, with a question.
“I like, ‘Hey, I want to be good at this. Will you work with me?’” Conley said. “We literally worked every day that summer leading up to my sophomore season, in the morning or in the afternoon for a couple of hours, just trying to get better.”
His sophomore year went well enough that Georgia offered him a scholarship, even taking an official visit to campus where he got to meet the Bulldogs’ star receiver at the time, AJ Green.
“I met [him] in the weight room,” he said. “We’re pretty cool. We don’t talk all the time now, but we converse.”
Living in the immense shadow Green left is something Conley is aware of, and it motivates him every day.
“We really want to put our mark on the program and on the offense, but I think there is a little bit of playing with that chip on your shoulder because everybody expects you not to measure up to who came before you,” he said of himself and his fellow receivers. “A big thing with us is wanting to prove what we can do, who we are. We’re here for a reason, and we feel we can do great things together and that’s what we’re trying to do.”
Even with his prep credentials, Conley arrived on campus without the promise of immediate playing time, as Sanders Commings recalled.


TNCMS.AdManager.render({region: 'fixed-big-ad-bottom-asset', slot: 1, fold: ""below""});


“He was going to get redshirted, and he wasn’t happy about it,” Commings said. “Coach Ball told him to work hard and show that he was capable and he did.”
And Conley said that is exactly the way it happened.
“I was more of a prospective, ‘we’re going to see how you work, see what happens’ kind of [guy],” he said. “I was just ready for anything. The opportunity that I’ve been given to contribute has been worthwhile. I love it.”
Conley could care less if he does not have great performances every game.
He just wants to see the team win regardless of who puts up the stats.
“Sometimes you have quiet games like last week, but as long as the offense is producing and doing great, I have no problem with that,” he said.
Part of putting up big stats is getting the ball thrown his way, and Conley could not be more happy playing with a quarterback in Aaron Murray who works every bit as hard as him.
“He really takes the offense on himself, whether it does great or it does bad, he takes it personally,” Conley said. “Another thing about him is his preparation. He does a lot of film study — hours of that. He meets with his coaches, he talks with each of the guys. ‘Hey, what are you seeing out there on the field? What are you going through? What’s open?’ He does a lot of things beyond what he has to that makes him great at what he does.”

Going beyond what is expected is just Conley’s nature, though.
He won’t stand for being complacent.
“You don’t want to get outworked, because you know there is someone in the country working hard, too,” he said. “In a couple of years, that’s going to matter a lot. There are going to be a lot of guys similar to you, and it’s those intangibles that are going to make [NFL] teams choose you.”
When it comes to life after a possible professional football career, Conley said he still wanted to stay around sports in some way.
“I really want to be a mentor,” he said. “Whether that’s in a coaching capacity or as a mentor to young men who are in athletics, I love working with people and talking with people. That comes easy to me. Down the road, I want to be someone who can give back.”
For now, he’s still a young receiver, with unlimited potential and a great work ethic.
And given all the room Conley still has to grow, Ball said he could not think of another receiver who he could compare Conley to.
“I hadn’t really thought about who he would remind me of, because he’s his own person,” he said. “He’s a receiver that is working to improve in his craft every day. Maybe a year from now I may be able to answer that. But right now, he’s Chris.”",Ryan Black,sports,https://www.redandblack.com/sports/freshman-wide-receiver-conley-worked-his-way-out-of-redshirting/article_b7df1f93-0183-544d-8a38-d5802567275f.html
19-Nov-11,LIVE BLOG: Kentucky vs. Georgia,"Greetings from Sanford Stadium. By now, most readers out there should  know the stakes riding on this game. If Georgia wins, it clinches a spot in the SEC Championship and takes home the SEC East Division title for the first time since 2005. If Georgia loses, its eight-game win streak is over and it means that the Kentucky Wildcats have pulled off a major upset.
The Wildcats come into Athens 4-6 overall and 1-5 in SEC play, with their lone victory in the league coming against Ole Miss, which is winless in conference competition this season.
The last time Kentucky visited Athens, it came away with a 34-27 victory over Georgia, but to pull off the feat again, it will have to find some semblance of an offense. The Wildcats rank 116th in the nation in points per game (17.0), 110th in passing yards per game (147.0) and 88th in rushing yards per game (126.5). Factor in that the Bulldogs boast the No. 4 unit in Division I in total defense, and the Wildcats’ task becomes that much tougher.


 


A few other stats to throw out there:

Georgia has dominated this series, holding a 50-12-2 edge in 64 meetings, and a 24-4-2 mark in Athens.
The Bulldogs are No. 3 in the SEC in scoring offense at 35.8 per contest.
Junior free safety Baccari Rambo is the NCAA’s active career leader in interception return yardage with 241, which ranks third in school history. He has 12 interceptions in three years.
A victory by the Bulldogs today would be their ninth straight this season, which would be the longest they have ever had under head coach Mark Richt in the same year. However, Georgia did win 11 straight games over two seasons under Richt in 2007 and 2008 (final seven games of 2007 and first four of 2008)
With one more touchdown pass, Bulldogs quarterback Aaron Murray will move into third in school history by himself with 52, passing Matt Stafford, who had 51 scoring tosses in his Georgia career. David Greene (72 touchdown passes) and Eric Zeier (67 touchdown passes) are first and second, respectively.

1st QUARTER
11:15 — So much for that impotent Wildcat offense, as Kentucky takes the opening drive of the game down the field to take a 3-0 lead after kicker Craig McIntosh’s 32-yard field goal attempt is successful.
8:46 — Despite his the many issues he has had on field goals this year, Bulldogs kicker Blair Walsh showed no negative signs on his first attempt today, splitting the uprights from 39-yards out to knot the game at 3-3.
4:44 — Bulldogs kicker Brandon Bogotay misses a 52-yard field goal try, but the bigger story right now is Isaiah Crowell. Crowell left the game on Georgia’s first drive with an apparent ankle injury, and has just been ushered into the locker room.
When we have more updates on his status, we will pass them along.
3:52 — Georgia cornerback Branden Smith picks off Kentucky quarterback Maxwell Smith and returns it 53 yards, helping the Bulldogs set up shop at the Wildcats’ 27-yard line.
2:12 — Blair Walsh makes his second 39-yard field goal of the game to give the Bulldogs their first lead at 6-3.
It was also just announced that Isaiah Crowell is “sidelined temporarily with an ankle injury.”
We assume that to mean he will return to the game at some point today, but only time will tell.

2nd QUARTER
11:20 — It’s been tough sledding for the Wildcat offense since their opening drive, as their last four possessions have been thus: punt, interception, punt, punt.
10:44 — On only his fifth carry of the year, Bulldogs running back Ken Malcome coughs up the ball and Kentucky recovers. The Wildcats will start their drive on Georgia’s 27-yard line.
8:30 — A dubious pass interference call on Georgia safety Sanders Commings gives a 1st-and-goal from the 2-yard line, and one play later Maxwell Smith hits a wide-open Tyler Robinson in the end zone to put Kentucky back on top 10-6 after a the extra point.
Georgia’s fans have come alive after the pass interference call, and if you’ll recall, the crowd played a role last week in the Bulldogs’ victory over Auburn after the Tigers could not hear many play calls.  We’ll see if that happens again today.
We should also pass along the news that Georgia running back Carlton Thomas is not playing today due to “personal reasons,” not a team violation or suspension of any kind.
4:20 — Special teams standout Blake Sailors once again comes up with a big play for the unit, downing Drew Butler’s punt at the 1-yard line.
4:02 — The Georgia defense shuts down the Kentucky offense at the 1-yard line, forcing three consecutive incomplete passes and leading to a punt return by Brandon Boykin that he took down the Wildcats’ 23-yard line.

1:53 — Is the Blair Walsh everyone thought they knew entering this season back? Maybe. Regardless, he is 3-for-3 today,  knocking it in from 25 yards to cut Kentucky’s advantage to 10-9.
1:45 — Georgia cornerback Quintavious Harrow forces a fumble on the ensuing kickoff, and Georgia has the ball back at Kentucky’s 30-yard line.
0:48 — There’s that man again: Walsh makes his fourth field goal of the first half, and his third from 39 yards to help the Bulldogs reclaim the lead at 12-10 just before halftime.
0:01 — With the Wildcat offense driving down the field to try to get on the board once more before heading to the locker room, Bulldogs cornerback Brandon Boykin snags the second interception of the game for Georgia’s defense.
I’ve taken you halfway, folks, and my colleague Nick Fouriezos will now take over live-blogging duties for the remainder of the game.

GEORGIA: 19 KENTUCKY: 10",Ryan Black,sports,https://www.redandblack.com/sports/football/live-blog-kentucky-vs-georgia/article_44454dc0-b461-53b6-9973-491e619c961e.html
19-Nov-11,BLAST FROM THE PAST: Senior kicker Walsh felt 'like old times' in final home game,"Blair Walsh's confidence in himself has been shaken at times this season.
He said it would be ""lying"" if he said otherwise.
And it's not hard to figure out why.


 


After making 40 out of 45 attempts over the 2009 and 2010 seasons, this year has been a struggle for the senior placekicker, who had converted on just 13 of 23 field goal attempts entering Georgia's matchup with Kentucky on Saturday.
But in his final home game at Sanford Stadium, Walsh returned to his old form, making all four field goals he attempted in the Bulldogs' 19-10 victory over the Wildcats.
""Your team giving you high-fives because you made them and not trying to console you because you missed them made it feel like old times today,"" he said.
The 13 points Walsh tallied against the Wildcats helped him move into second place in both school history and SEC history in total points with 393, behind only former Bulldog kicking great Billy Bennett, who finished his career with 409.
Helping put points on the board for the Bulldogs is something that never gets old to Walsh, though.
""It's the most satisfying feeling in the world,"" he said. ""I was just hoping to come in and get one attempt, but to go out here and finish 4-for-4, I couldn't ask for more.""
The fact that his kicks were an essential part of helping the Bulldogs clinch the Southeastern Conference's Eastern Division made it even better.
""This is the culmination of what we've been working for all year,"" he said.


 


Walsh's quartet of field goals stood as the only points the Georgia offense could muster until the final period — when the Bulldogs were finally able to punch it in the end zone on an Aaron Murray touchdown pass— which didn't go unnoticed by his teammates.
"" He was the sole reason we got any points in the first half and the beginning of the second half,"" fellow senior Brandon Boykin said. ""This being his last game here, I know he wanted to go out on top, and that's what he did.""
His teammates never lost faith in his ability despite his up-and-down season, either.
""I know he feels great,"" running back Brandon Harton said. ""He's had a rough season kicking, but we all know Blair's a great kicker. He comes out every day and works hard, and it just so happens that sometimes it doesn't go his way, but we all have confidence in him.""
After it didn't go Walsh's way enough, Georgia head coach Mark Richt decided to have Walsh and backup Brandon Bogotay battle it out for the starting placekicking job.
""My thinking in all of that was competition,"" Richt said. ""It wasn't to threaten anybody or anything like that. It was 'Let's compete.' I know when we brought in Bogotay, that lit a fire under Blair. It was like, 'He ain't beating me out.' It was like when Kwame [Geathers] got fired up because John Jenkins was coming in.""
The problem was that neither kicker separated himself from the other, which prompted Richt to employ an alternating kicker rotation between the two.
Richt went away from that system on Saturday, however, because he felt Walsh was ""extremely hot,"" a decision that he didn't regret after Walsh converted on all four of his field goal attempts.


TNCMS.AdManager.render({region: 'fixed-big-ad-bottom-asset', slot: 1, fold: ""below""});


But if Walsh felt like his performance on Saturday should help him reclaim his spot as the sole placekicker for the Bulldogs once more, he would not say it.
""That's not my decision,"" he said. ""I don't know what [Coach Richt] is thinking. I'm just working on it and I'm just grateful he let me kick those four today.""
Besides, Walsh would rather savor what his play on Saturday meant to the team as a whole instead.
""It's awesome to come through when your team is depending on you,"" he said. ""These guys work hard and it's awesome to help carry them to the SEC East title.""",Ryan Black,sports,https://www.redandblack.com/sports/blast-from-the-past-senior-kicker-walsh-felt-like-old/article_d6143d60-bd3b-57e3-915c-d9919b438409.html
3-Dec-11,Georgia's win streak snapped in 42-10 blowout loss to Tigers in SEC title game,"ATLANTA — It was one half of elation and a second half of frustration for a Georgia football team that had nothing to lose, coming in as double-digit underdogs.
But presented with a surprising halftime lead, the Bulldogs suddenly had a championship in their sights, only to watch it fade.
No. 12 Georgia (10-3, 7-1) saw a 10-7 lead evaporate in the second half as top-ranked LSU (13-0) rode a wave of emotion and confidence to a 42-10 victory to win the Southeastern Conference Championship and assure itself a spot in the BCS National Championship Game.


 


""First half, basically we stood our ground,"" cornerback Brandon Boykin said. ""We were already undervalued and people didn't expect us to do anything. Against a championship team like they are though we have to be consistent throughout the whole game.""
The Georgia players, who had overcome major odds to lead No.1 LSU at halftime, had to watch as the Tigers scored touchdown after touchdown in the third quarter to build an insurmountable, 18-point lead going into the fourth quarter.
""I'm sure that's what people are going to say,"" Boykin said about the idea of the game being a story of two halves. ""Georgia couldn't maintain it the whole game, things like that — so yeah, they're right. We couldn't and we didn't so that's why [LSU] won the game.""
Bulldog quarterback Aaron Murray fumbled on the first possession of the second half — the first of three turnovers committed by the sophomore signal-caller — which set the Tigers up on the Georgia 26-yard line.
From that favorable field position, the Tigers took advantage and scored two plays later on a 15-yard touchdown run by Kenny Hilliard, the first of three second-half touchdowns by the freshman running back.
The score put the Tigers ahead for the first time in the game and they wouldn't give up the lead again as they began a 18-0 scoring spree to finish the game.
""Kenny made a couple of key cuts and a couple of key runs in that game,"" LSU head coach Les Miles said. ""It really looked like he had a hot hand and we didn't want to go away from him. He made great cuts and is very physical and it was just that kind of game.""
The Tigers' comeback win began in the second quarter, when cornerback Tyrann Mathieu fielded a punt on his own 38-yard line and tore his way through Bulldog defenders on his way to a 62-yard touchdown return.


 


It was his second punt return touchdown in the last two games and gave the Tigers their only points in the first half.
""It was huge,"" Boykin said. ""That was the momentum shifter for them singlehandedly.""
Mathieu said that he was determined to score on the play and turn momentum back over to his team's sideline.
""Obviously we got to a slow start, so I just felt like I needed to change the momentum of the game and it was the perfect time,""Mathieu said. ""With that punt return, I just had to make one guy miss and get up the field.""
There was a moment of controversy on the touchdown where Mathieu pitched the ball over to the official as he crossed over the goal line, with replays showing that he might not have crossed the line before throwing the ball forward.
""I could see the referee looking at me kind of strange, I'll be sure next time that I cross the goal line,"" Mathieu said.
The play was not reviewed by the officiating crew.
Meanwhile, the Georgia offense struggled in all facets of the game, unable to run or pass against the LSU defense after having success in their first few drives.


TNCMS.AdManager.render({region: 'fixed-big-ad-bottom-asset', slot: 1, fold: ""below""});


""They presented a ton of problems,"" offensive coordinator Mike Bobo said. ""We gave away the field position right off the bat and then we could never change the field position and we just stayed in the hole for the whole second half.""
They scored 10 points in the first half but were only able to convert four third downs and gain 161 total yards with no scores for the remainder of the game.
Bobo had a short answer for why the Bulldogs struggled against LSU's defense in the second half after playing well at first.
""Because they're pretty good,"" Bobo said.
Even with the early success they had, the Georgia players said that there was an opportunity for an even bigger first half lead if it weren't for two dropped passes that could have resulted in touchdowns.
""We as a receiver unit left a lot of plays on the field,"" said wide receiver Tavarres King, who dropped a first quarter pass in the end zone. ""Touchdowns, even. Myself and Malcolm could tell you — he had one that he considered a touchdown. It was a pretty rough night.""
And for tight end Aron White, the lone Bulldog player to score a touchdown against the Tigers' defense, their wasn't much of an explanation for the offense's struggles in the second half.
""If I had that kind of answer, if I had known something was going on, I would have said something earlier,"" White said. ""It was probably a combination of things.""

White mentioned that having to play from behind played a role in the offense's inefficiency as well as a mentality of trying to preserve the lead instead of adding to it.
""It could have been a number of different things, but I don't have all the answers and I don't know the answer to that question,"" White said.
If he had to pinpoint a single moment where the course of the game changed though, White said that the momentum shifted with Hilliard's 15-yard touchdown at the beginning of the second half.
""We give it to them twice on the 20 — once off a punt return and once off a turnover — and we can't ask our defense to stop somebody if we start them off in the red zone,"" White said. ""I feel like that started their momentum and we kind of caved after that.""",Nicholas Fouriezos,sports,https://www.redandblack.com/sports/georgia-s-win-streak-snapped-in---blowout-loss/article_b8d73f9e-73b2-5996-86d2-c948660e19cf.html
5-Dec-11,"Garrison Smith reaching new heights, looks to build on breakout performance","Garrison Smith knew he had to be ready to answer the call on the defensive line as the first man off the bench against Georgia Tech.
Whether it be at nose tackle or defensive end, defensive line coach Rodney Garner had been preparing Smith to be a major player in the defensive line rotation.
Garner just wasn't expecting Smith to have to step in as soon as he did.


 


""I didn't know where, but I was like, 'Hey, you gotta be ready to go,'"" Garner said. ""Little did I know that it was going to be on the second play of the game, but I'm proud of him. To see him have that kind of success is good, because he's an outstanding young man that tries to do what we ask him to do.""
The success Garner is referring to is the superlative performance Smith put on in place of injured teammate DeAngelo Tyson, as Smith notched seven tackles — which included 1.5 tackles for loss — in Georgia's 31-17 victory over Georgia Tech on Nov. 26.
Smith's play was recognized by the SEC, who named him the conference's defensive lineman of the week following the game, an accomplishment that left the sophomore humbled.
""It's a great honor and a blessing,"" he said. ""I just want to give the glory to God. Without God it wouldn't be possible. That's what got me this far.""
Getting praise from his injured teammate meant almost as much to Smith as the award did, though.
""DeAngelo told me 'Good job,' that he was proud of me and he called me his 'little brother,'"" Smith said. ""I was real happy about that.""
Smith's older brother Greg, a former Yellow Jacket himself, even congratulated his younger brother after the Bulldogs beat his alma mater.
""He was real excited,"" said Smith, who noted that his older brother would have sat with Georgia fans if he had been able to attend the game. ""He was real happy that we won and happy that I played good. He was just telling me he was proud of me.""


 


Smith was also proud of himself, and for what he felt the performance would do for his self-confidence going forward.
""I always knew I had it in me, I was just nervous about playing, adjusting to [Georgia Tech's] offense,"" he said. ""It was just real big to play and do good.""
But his teammates had already noticed how well Smith has played this season, as he has logged playing time in all 13 of the Bulldogs' games this year.
""'G-Baby' has been performing the whole season,"" nose tackle John Jenkins said. ""... He had a good game when Tyson went down, yeah, but it shouldn't have to take Tyson to go down for everybody to acknowledge how well he's been playing this season.""
Jenkins also attested to how much of a mentor Smith has been to him, especially when Jenkins was dealing with the struggles of transitioning from a junior college to a Division I university.
""There was one point when I was in a situation like, 'Man, this is crazy. This is too hard,' and then Garrison talked to me and was like, 'Just keep going, man. Take it day-by-day,'"" Jenkins said. ""He was helping to point me in the direction of a greater prize, dealing with [what was] in front of me.""
Smith knew all too well how to handle adversity after being around the tough love coaching style Garner utilizes.
""He just wants the best out of you — he demands it — so you just have to do your best everyday to try to get better,"" Smith said.


TNCMS.AdManager.render({region: 'fixed-big-ad-bottom-asset', slot: 1, fold: ""below""});


And Smith eventually came to realize how much it meant that Garner even said anything to him in the first place.
""Since I was little, I've always been told that when people say stuff to you, they care about you and want to do better,"" he said. ""But when people stop saying something to you, that's when you need to worry, because that means they don't care about you anymore.""
With the help of Garner's coaching and the ""fighter"" mentality Smith said he acquired growing up in Atlanta, he knows that the Georgia Tech game bodes well for the future.
""Last year I was still trying to learn everything, and it was hard,"" he said. ""...I haven't reached my peak. I'm still a young player and still developing my skills, so it feels good to keep getting better.""

5-Jan-12,University student killed in car accident in India,"Correction appended.
A University student and two family members were killed in a car accident while visiting family in India on Dec. 19.
Bhavin Patel, a sophomore and member of the Delta Epsilon Psi fraternity, was killed while riding in a car with family members near Sanghi village when the driver of the car lost control and swerved into another lane, according to DNA News (http://www.dnaindia.com/). His father, sister and six other extended family members were killed in the crash.


 


Patel’s father Jay worked in business in Thomaston and sister Payal was in pharmacy school at Mercer University. According to DNA News, they returned to India to celebrate the marriage of a family member.
The Delta Epsilon Psi national website released a statement saying the organization mourns the loss of their brother. They said he was a kind-hearted, selfless and dependable person who was committed to the organization and never stopped smiling.
The candlelight vigil hosted by the Delta Epsilon Psi’s Alpha Alpha Colony in honor of Patel next week already has more than 200 attendees on Facebook.
For students looking to attend, the candlelight vigil will be hosted by Patel’s fraternity brothers on Jan. 11 at the Tate Center at 11 a.m. For more details about the vigil, a link to the event is available on the Alpha Alpha Colony’s Facebook page.

8-Jan-12,"No. 16 Georgia bounces back from first conference loss, dispatches Auburn 70-45","Jasmine James wanted Georgia to be what it was supposed to be.
An inspired performance from the junior point guard made sure that came to fruition as the No. 16 Lady Bulldogs (13-3, 2-1) defeated the Auburn Tigers 70-45 on the road Sunday afternoon.
""I just wanted to come out today and bring a lot of energy,"" James said. ""I knew on both ends I had to be very aggressive today. It paid off well defensively and offensively — it was an intention of mine to be more aggressive today, and hopefully [we will] continue for the rest of the year to be more aggressive.""


 


The contribution of James as well as a dominant defensive performance by the Lady Dogs saw them bounce back from their worst loss of the season, an 80-51 defeat to No. 7 Tennessee on Thursday.
""I think our defensive effort set the stage for everything that transpired this afternoon,"" Georgia head coach Andy Landers said. ""I think we got them out of control [and] they threw up some wild shots that set us up for some rebounds. We were able to trap them and force them to throw the ball away — I think our defense just set up everything.""
Leading the team was James, whose explosive early play set the tone for the Lady Dogs. Georgia ran out to an early 13-point lead, holding the hosts scoreless for nearly eight minutes.
The first half was defined by the Lady Dogs high-intensity defense, which showed all of the effort Landers said was missing in the loss to the Lady Volunteers.
James led the team in the first half as she recorded three of Georgia’s 10 steals, which contributed to 18 turnovers by the Tigers (9-7, 1-2) in the first 20 minutes.
Landers was pleased his team showed the effort he had widely criticized them for earlier in the week.
""That’s the piece that can’t fluctuate,"" he said. ""It did on Thursday night. The effort just wasn’t acceptable. Today was very, very different and that kind of effort usually renders a positive outcome.""
James was also happy with the way Georgia controlled Auburn's offense for the majority of the first half.


 


""To be able to defend that well and be able to disrupt and get easy baskets... was really huge for us,"" she said. ""To be able to get the lead, and not only get it, but we were able to extend it throughout the game, it really helped us to be able to get off to a great start.""
After controlling the first half with their defense, Georgia let its offense do the work in the second half as it outscored Auburn 40-28.
The ability of forward Jasmine Hassell to assert herself in the paint saw her score 14 points, which tied James for the team lead.
James did more than just score, however, as she also finished with 5 steals and 3 assists, while  senior Meredith Mitchell led the team in rebounds with 8.
The Lady Dogs have struggled at times this season to maintain their performance in the second half of games, but they did not let that happen against the Tigers.
That did not go unnoticed by Landers.
""I hope that that’s a sign that we continue to improve,"" Landers said. ""We have struggled [where] we haven’t always delivered the knockout punch, but today there was no question who was in control from the time the ball went up until the final alarm went off.""
James agreed with her coach.

""It’s something that we talked about at halftime,"" James said ""We wanted to go out in the second half and play it just like we did the first half. We did a really good job of still defending them and defending the lead and not giving them anything easy. I feel like we did a really good job of that.""",Matthew Pearce,sports,https://www.redandblack.com/sports/no-georgia-bounces-back-from-first-conference-loss-dispatches-auburn/article_9d4b49c9-693f-58bb-8e04-c192ce227ebd.html

We’ll show coworkers our first fake IDs, talk about our North Campus run-ins with police and maybe even pull out the mug shot after enough time passes to enjoy some good, old-fashioned self-deprecation.
But not all of us will be laughing.

12-Jan-12,Allman Brothers tribute band honors year of the peach,"In Atlanta, a falling peach ushered in the New Year, but for Athens Allman brother fans, the peachiness is just getting started.
Forty years ago, the Allman brothers released their “Eat A Peach” album and the band recently declared 2012 the year of the peach.
In keeping with the fruity focus, the Other Brothers Band, an Athens-based Allman Brothers tribute band, will perform the songs from “Eat A Peach.”


 


“We’re gonna be playing that album in its entirety,” said guitarist Greg Kearney. “Just being [the album’s] 40th anniversary, we thought we’d kind of tip our hats to them. Not to mention the band that’s opening up, Bonobos Convergence, actually includes a guy named Vaylor Trucks, which is the Allman Brothers’ original drummer’s son. So it’s gonna be a good night.”
The Other Brothers Band originally formed from a band called Tent City. And in honor of the Allman Brothers, Tent City added member Bo Hembree on guitar and vocals and a tribute band was born.
“We play only Allman Brothers songs. We’re made up of members of different bands, but when we play under this moniker, we’re basically just a tribute band for the Allman Brothers,” Kearney said. “It’s about as close as you can get to the Allman Brothers without being them.”
When the band members originally assembled, they only expected to perform a single tribute concert.
However, when the Other Brothers Band drew bigger crowds than it anticipated, the group decided to keep playing together.
“We were going to do just a one-time tribute to the Allman Brothers and we got a good response. So we kept doing [it] — we kept booking shows across the Southeast,” Kearney said.
Because the Other Brothers Band is a tribute band, shows and Allman Brothers love is what keeps its members going.
“Oh gosh, we’ve all been raised up on the Allman Brothers, being Georgia boys and a couple other guys are from Alabama, but, yes, the Allman Brothers are definitely one of the South’s favorite bands,” Kearney said. “It’s been playing since I was little, growing up, and I think the other guys would attest to it as well. But we’re just big fans of their music.”


 


The Other Brothers Band aspires to capture the blues element of the Southern-style rock music.
Its sound includes pulsing bass, extended guitar riffs and steady, mellow percussion.
Kearney particularly enjoys the riffs.
“Definitely I dig improvising,” he said. “You know, every time we play, the song’s not going to be the same as the next time. We don’t have set structure you know, some of our parts or anything like that you just really kind of let loose and play what you feel. It’s just, you know, the ability to be able to kind of improvise and read each other and let the music kind of go where it wants to.”
Prepared to keep up the peachiness in the peach state, the Other Brothers Band is excited for its second Melting Point performance.
“We’ve got some Allman Brothers family in the house,” Kearney said. “And you know, with the ‘Eat A Peach’ [album] it’s going to be a memorable evening.”

1-Feb-12,"Harvey-Clemons, Dawson pledge allegiance to Georgia","Defensive end Josh Dawson of Tucker is the newest member of Georgia's 2012 recruiting class.
Dawson had committed to Vanderbilt earlier in his recruitment, but he switched his allegiance to the Bulldogs on Signing Day.
Josh Harvey-Clemons announced his intentions to sign for the Georgia Bulldogs at roughly 9:30 a.m.


 


With the commitment of Harvey-Clemons, the Bulldogs have signed arguably the state’s top three players in Harvey-Clemons, Jordan Jenkins and Jonathan Taylor.
The 6-foot-5, 210-pound outside linebacker is expected to compete for immediate playing time when he arrives in Athens.
He is a unanimous top 100 national recruit by all major recruiting services.
Harvey-Clemons becomes the Bulldogs third outside linebacker commit, joining Jenkins and Leonard Floyd.
 
OTHER NEWS:
The Bulldogs missed out on two big time wide receivers today.
Cordarrelle Patterson chose the Tennessee Volunteers over the Bulldogs early in the morning.


 


Patterson is the nation’s top rated junior college prospect, and stands at 6-foot-4, 205-pounds.
Another big receiver the Bulldogs missed out on was 6-foot-3, 205-pound JaQuay Williams.
Williams has been committed to Auburn since June, but recently visited the Bulldogs causing some controversy. But ultimately he decided to stick with the Tigers.
In a class that the Bulldogs needed to take at least two receivers in, it looks like the Bulldogs will only sign one in Blake Tibbs.

1-Feb-12,Defensive back Dawson becomes commit No. 17 for Bulldogs in 2012,"The Georgia Bulldogs received their first commitment from a defensive back in the class of 2012 on Monday night when 5-foot-11, 170-pound Sheldon Dawson of Ridgeway High School in Memphis, Tenn., switched his commitment from the Memphis Tigers to the Bulldogs.
Other than offensive lineman Avery Young, Dawson was the most important recruit left on the Bulldogs' recruiting board, with an immense need for defensive backs to close the class.
Ranked as the No. 1 prospect in the state of Tennessee by Scout.com, Dawson is one of the quickest recruits in the nation.


 


He has consistently been timed in the 4.4 second range in the 40-yard dash and has a first step that may be second-to-none in this year's class.
He excelled on both offense and defense his junior season at Ridgeway, rushing for 1,045 yards and 14 touchdowns on an eye-popping 20.3 yards per carry, according to his Rivals.com profile. He also added 42 tackles, with one interception and 11 pass breakups on defense.
Just how did the Bulldogs sway Dawson from his home city school?
“Basically just the atmosphere and the coaching staff [at Georgia],” Dawson said. “They have a pretty unique coaching staff. I like them all a lot. I like the family atmosphere down there. It makes somebody want to go out and play, and that really attracted me a lot.”
Dawson expanded further upon his reasons for choosing Georgia.
“I like the coaches, I like overall how they've been playing lately, and if you come down there and work hard your going to play,” Dawson told the Red & Black. “I like the atmosphere, it was great. Players wanted to be around players, coaches wanted to be around the players. It was more of a family.”
When talking with the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, Dawson said the Georgia coaches and players have extremely high expectations of him in Athens.
“Everybody on the team said I remind them of Brandon Boykin,” Dawson told the AJC, citing that the coaches told him he will have the opportunity to play offense as well.


 


Now that Dawson is officially the Bulldogs 17th commitment, he is set to sign his letter of intent at 2:30 p.m on Feb. 1.
The speedster couldn't be more relieved to get things finalized and close out the recruiting process.
“[The recruiting process] was pretty hectic, it kind of wore me down, but I had to look at it overall as a blessing,"" he said.
Whenever Dawson signs the dotted lines on Wednesday afternoon, he simply said that he would feel “good, great and relieved.”
After Signing Day, Dawson will turn to working out in the weight room and hard training to fulfill his plans in his first year as a Bulldog, which he said was to “win an SEC championship.”",Red And Black,sports,https://www.redandblack.com/sports/defensive-back-dawson-becomes-commit-no-for-bulldogs-in/article_0f2d0964-166f-5350-98dd-194ccff9dd79.html
2-Feb-12,Tales from the recruiting trail,"Everyone take a deep breath.
The chaotic recruiting cycle has officially ended for the class of 2012, and Georgia can exhale after landing an overall quality class.
The Bulldogs had their ups, filling huge positions of need with high quality players, including John Theus at offensive line, Keith Marshall at running back and Jonathan Taylor at defensive tackle.


 


But they also had their downs, losing four commitments over the process.
As strenuous as it all was on Bulldog football coaches and fans, the biggest effects were taken in by the recruits themselves.
These are the 17 or 18-year-old young adults who just concluded perhaps the most hectic and mentally stimulating event in their young lives, signing their intent to represent the university of their choice for the next four years.
For some, like Bulldogs outside linebacker signee James Deloach, going through the recruiting cycle was fun, but got to be a nuisance.
“I liked it a lot,” Deloach said. “Once you get further down the road, you start figuring out who you like. Other schools will try and still recruit you — they try and make you commit even when knowing you have another school in your heart. That’s what made me commit.”
Bulldogs fullback signee Quayvon Hicks held mixed emotions pertaining to the entire process as well.
“It was a great experience, I enjoyed it, I enjoyed visiting different schools, visiting different camps, so overall it was just a great experience. Especially with me being more of a sociable person, you get to meet a lot of great athletes out there,” Hicks said. “After a while though, some things from the scouts I didn’t want to be bothered with anymore. You want to stay a kid as long as you can, and try and enjoy the process without it changing you as a person.”
Greg Pyke, offensive lineman signee for the Bulldogs, had his own theory on the process.


 


“As a lineman, it’s definitely different from other kids that play the skill positions like running back or quarterback,” Pyke said. “I think that if you see really good position guys, they’re going to definitely be recruited. I think it’s probably harder to get looked at as a lineman because there’s just so many of them. I like the recruiting process though.”
The toughest aspect of the recruiting cycle for recruits is narrowing down their list of schools, and ultimately setting their heart on a final decision.
Hicks credited the university itself as to why he chose Georgia.
“The great opportunity to get a great education from one of the biggest universities in the nation, I think that’s the biggest thing, and that played a big part in my decision,” he said.
Pyke didn’t know early on where he would end up, but it only took a single step on Georgia’s campus to figure out.
“I would say when I first stepped foot on campus I knew I wanted to go there. There was no doubt in my mind,” Pyke said. “I made a good decision to come down to Georgia just by chance. I went down for a one day camp and it all worked out.”
There are 15 other Bulldog signees alongside Pyke, Hicks and Deloach in the 2012 class — a class that has stirred up an interesting motto.
“I think it was John Theus who said it, but last year was the ‘Dream Team,’ and this year is the ‘Ring Team,’” Deloach said.


TNCMS.AdManager.render({region: 'fixed-big-ad-bottom-asset', slot: 1, fold: ""below""});


While the 2011 class may have borrowed their name from the great 1992 U.S. Men’s Olympic Basketball team, the “Ring Team” mantra is an original name with one ultimate goal — to win the national championship as soon as possible.
“I think we got some players that are ready to work,” Hicks said. “They know what they did in high school is only mediocre, and it’s time to do bigger and better things. They’re going to help push me to the ledge so we can get the job done. I think we’re going to do something great. It’s time to get to work and get this ring next year.”
As eager as this year’s class of Bulldogs is at getting their shot on the field, they still must finish out their final semester of school before reporting to Georgia in June.
Until then, the recruits will find different ways to stay motivated until their arrival in Athens.
“I’m just finishing school and playing lacrosse, that starts in the middle of February and goes til May,” Pyke said. “I graduate the second [of June] from my high school, and I’ll be at Georgia the fourth, on my birthday, actually.”
Deloach can’t wait to get to campus, either.
In fact, he already knows what Bulldog star he’s going to go to for advice to help the team get closer to its goal of bringing home a national championship.
“I’m just going to work out hard, try and get in-shape,” he said. “I want to be in tip-top shape. I want to study some of the playbook, and keep my grades right so I can learn from Jarvis Jones, who said he was going to work with me on my technique.”",Justin Johnson,sports,https://www.redandblack.com/sports/tales-from-the-recruiting-trail/article_dbdf7e2d-8675-5ae1-baf0-fbac9ca0a5c5.html

6-Feb-12,Board of Regents to vote on graduate engineering programs,"The Board of Regents will vote Tuesday on two new graduate engineering programs to begin at the University in fall 2012.

The new programs, a master’s and Ph.D. in engineering, will not have designated specializations but will lend themselves to a more “comprehensive engineering education,” according to the proposal in the Regents’ agenda.
If passed, the graduate programs are set to build upon the three undergraduate engineering majors approved in November 2010: civil, mechanical and electrical engineering. Civil engineering enrollment is expected to begin this fall, and students will be able to enroll in the other undergraduate majors by 2013.
The University already offers master’s degrees in agricultural, environmental, biochemical and biological engineering. According to the agenda, the new degrees will be able to better adapt to changes within the field.
Graduate degrees are becoming increasingly important for work in certain fields within engineering, making “strong” graduate programs a crucial step for the University, according to the agenda.

“Building a strong continuum of undergraduate and graduate engineering education is essential to meeting state and national needs,” the agenda stated. “With this program UGA seeks to increase the state of Georgia’s capacity for engineering education.”


 



The University Council Executive Committee approved the proposal to be added to the Regents’ agenda in an e-mail vote last June.
The decision to add the graduate programs by fall came after hiring difficulties. Some potential faculty members said they preferred to work for an institution that offered Ph.D. programs, University Provost Jere Morehead said in July.
If approved, the master’s and Ph.D. programs will require no additional resources of the engineering department. Faculty will already have been hired to teach the undergraduate courses, according to the Executive Committee minutes from June.
Enrollment in the engineering master’s program is projected to move from 3 to 15 students within its first three years.
Five students are expected to enroll in the Ph.D. program the first year, rising to 25 by its third year.",Megan Ingalls,news,https://www.redandblack.com/news/board-of-regents-to-vote-on-graduate-engineering-programs/article_fdbc2f6f-3083-5da1-b2e9-c23409c0837b.html
7-Feb-12,Board of Regents approves graduate engineering programs,"The Board of Regents approved two graduate engineering programs and a new professorship for the Jewish Studies program in a vote Tuesday.
Regents spokesman John Millsaps said the members passed the agenda items concerning the University with little discussion.
The newly accepted programs, a master’s and Ph.D. in engineering, will begin enrolling students next fall. The programs will follow in the footsteps of the three undergraduate engineering majors approved in November 2010.

The Regents also approved the professorship, a position that will receive its funding through private donations. The Covenant Foundation, Inc. has set aside $250,000 to establish the position, hoping to help support Jewish Studies at the University.

Donors such as the Covenant Foundation usually set up funds for specific programs and go through the University of Georgia Foundation to make sure the money is used for its intended purpose.



 


According to the proposal in the Regents’ agenda, “the holder of the endowed position shall be engaged in teaching, research, public service, or a combination of such duties” and cannot specialize in any other area of religion.
The Regents also voted to terminate three veterinary programs.
Students previously in these programs transferred to the school's newly established department of infectious diseases. No students were enrolled in either of the two master’s or the Ph.D. programs.",Megan Ingalls,news,https://www.redandblack.com/news/board-of-regents-approves-graduate-engineering-programs/article_214cfe66-d188-5c76-ad08-0b982515903e.html
18-Feb-12,Thousands predicted to turnout for cultural celebration,"Picture the Classic Center filled with more than 2,000 people, intermittently punctuated with vibrant saris.
To complete the scene, add a musical fusion of traditional Bollywood and hip-hop tunes, along with a stage of synchronized dancers.
This is the essence of India Night 2012.


 


In this year’s “India Night 2012: Hamari Manzil,” the Indian Cultural Exchange (ICE) will dance through the twentieth year of its award-winning cultural awareness program.
One possible reason for its success is the event’s magnetic pull on the Athens Indian community, said Prachi Bhardwaj, India Night fusion dancer and after-party helper.
“Athens doesn’t really — it has an Indian community, but its kind of hard to find it, and all of the different clubs they have and all of the bars and everything,” she said. “So its kind of Athens’ one opportunity for the Indian culture to come out.”
India Night has also won a SOAR — or Student Organization Achievement and Recognition — award for “Outstanding Cultural Awareness Program” in three different years, perhaps bolstering the event’s visibility.
“Everyone gets really into it,” Bhardwaj said. “I think the biggest reason is because of how much hype is centered around it — there’s a pre-party and an after-party and then we have India Night Hype Week, so all week [there is] one event or another Monday through Friday — and all the acts in the show are also entertaining, too. You have the classical stuff, you have the more modern, like hip-hop music, and then the singing and the instrument stuff, too. I think the fact that there’s so much to offer intrigues people.""
In addition to ICE’s hype on campus, the organization also enlists the help of local businesses.
Sponsors help ICE shoulder the costs of India Night’s production.
“How we raise money is, we contact a lot of local businesses and what we do, we do a trade-off,” said Parin Patel, India Night chair. “So as a sponsor for our show, you get to place advertisements in our program.”


 


Not all of the event’s attendance numbers come from Athens either.
Other Georgia universities, including Georgia Tech, Georgia State, Emory University and Mercer University are invited as well.
“There are also Indian Cultural Exchanges at those locations,” Patel said. “They help us get the word out.”
With so many outlets for publicity, the event’s turnout is easier to understand.
Bhardwaj and Patel said the evening’s content and showcased talent were noteworthy, too.
“I think it’s great just the way it is,” Patel said. “I know a lot of people say that they would have it as a competition, so it would attract more people from a farther distance. But the fact that it’s a showcase of the Indian culture, I think it’s better, because it kind of adds more appeal for people who are not Indian and just want to learn more about the culture.”

23-Feb-12,MAILBOX: Feb. 23,"Alternative Energy should be Univ. Path
I hope I wasn’t the only one whose mind was blown by the university’s $20 million electricity bill. As a student, I’d like to see the $500 I contribute to that bill cut by a significant margin. Unfortunately, other than by encouraging students to turn off lights and switch the knob on the thermostat, the university is over a barrel with its electricity costs. How do we go about saving money and our future from growing energy demand while keeping the bigwigs at Georgia Power from getting their panties in a bunch? Two words: Clean energy.
In order for change to occur, everyone needs to be taken care of; the university needs to save money, GP needs to keep its revenue, and the UGA community needs a healthy and prosperous future.  The simple answer is to incorporate renewable energy resources (solar/solar-thermal, geothermal, and wind) into the university’s ten-year build plan.


 


Take, for example, UGA’s glorious new library, Hargrett.  The rooftop area is enough to accommodate at least 350 kilowatts worth of solar panel electricity; enough to power about 100 homes a day! The excess electricity produced can be sold back to Georgia Power at a premium rate. With growing EPA restrictions on coal power and falling support for nuke plants, Georgia Power’s production costs are projected to rise. Cheap electricity from UGA could be a boost for sales.
Another possibility, soft-spoken but hard-hitting, is the use of geothermal heat pumps to cool our buildings during the summer. These systems take warm air, pump that heat into the ground, and provide cool, comfortable air in return. To pay for such projects, the university could make gradual cuts to its budget for electricity. If that’s a no-go, there is a very influential donor by the name of Rutherford Seydel who has expressed interest in making such an investment in his Alma mater’s future.
I hope our administration will keep its eyes open to the golden opportunities it has to lead the Southeast into an economically and environmentally sustainable future.

28-Feb-12,Bulldogs win praise from rival league coaches in weekly teleconference,"Georgia garnered respect across the Southeastern Conference on Monday after its 76-62 victory over No. 11 Florida on Saturday.
“Georgia’s team continues to improve and they play really hard with passion and energy,” Florida head coach Billy Donovan said during the league's weekly teleconference. “I think when you’re coaching a team that’s really struggling, it’s tough. They have gotten better, improved and played very physical. I think it’s a great tribute to their kids, regardless of their record, that they continue to battle hard every game.”
Kentucky head coach John Calipari — whose top-ranked Wildcats squad takes on Georgia Thursday — echoed Donovan remarks about the Bulldogs.


 


“They’re playing a lot different than they were early in the year,” Calipari said. “They’re way more confident and they’re shooting the ball extremely well. They’re playing off handoffs, which I haven’t seen them do before. I told my staff today that what I get impressed with other coaches is when, as the year goes on, they start adjusting to their team. They’re playing different and [Georgia head coach Mark Fox] is getting results. I know we’re going to face an opponent who is ready to come in here and win.”
Though the Bulldogs were able to beat the Gators in their second meeting after dropping the first matchup on Jan. 10, Fox said he did not think people should jump to the same conclusion about Thursday's game against Kentucky.
The Bulldogs fell to the Wildcats 57-44 in the two teams' previous meeting this season, which took place on Jan. 24 in Athens.
“Obviously a win over a great Florida team will give us some confidence, but it won’t have a whole lot to do with our game on Thursday [against Kentucky],” Fox said. “I feel that our team has been focused on taking one game at a time and not taking the previous game into the next one. We’re going to have to play extremely, extremely well to have a chance to win the game.”
Fox believes Kentucky has improved since the first meeting, despite the fact that the Wildcats were the No. 1 team in the nation at the time.
“This is a team that you have a hard time finding any weaknesses,” Fox said. “They’re better in probably every way. I think offensively, they appear to be playing extremely well together. Defensively, they were dynamite before. They can beat you in so many different ways. Jones appears to be playing very well. They also have a terrific home court advantage to go with all that.”
Calipari, who has revitalized the Kentucky program since his arrival in 2009, also touched on the NBA Draft rules during his teleconference.
The Kentucky head coach has produced some notable stars that went on to have professional success, despite only playing college ball for one year.


 


Some of those names include John Wall, DeMarcus Cousins, and reigning NBA MVP Derrick Rose, who Calipari coached at Memphis.
“I don’t like the one-and-done rule,” Calipari said. “It’s not my rule, but if a kid plays really well and that’s what he chooses to do, you can talk him out of it or the other option is don’t recruit players well enough to be drafted. Until the rules change, we’re all dealing with it.”
Calipari further said no draft talk is discussed during the season and that the focus of the Kentucky team is getting back to the Final Four.
“You just have to keep the players’ well being in mind,” Calipari said. “During the year, it’s about the team. In the offseason, it’s about each individual player. It’s too early to tell what anyone is going to do right now. I tell them they need to worry about being a great college player. Bill Gates left school and went out to change the world. It’s about looking at the opportunities and seeing what’s right.”",Daniel Kramer,sports,https://www.redandblack.com/sports/bulldogs-win-praise-from-rival-league-coaches-in-weekly-teleconference/article_6ca12834-1d78-5dd2-9ec0-b3988322857a.html
5-Mar-12,Georgia draft prospects audition for NFL scouts at Pro Day,"The Georgia football team held its Pro Day in windy conditions on Monday, giving potential NFL Draft prospects the chance to improve upon their performances at the league’s scouting combine last week in Indianapolis, Ind.
Those who worked out included tight ends Orson Charles and Aron White, offensive linemen Cordy Glenn, Justin Anderson and Ben Jones, specialists Blair Walsh, Drew Butler and Brandon Bogotay, fullback Bruce Figgins, defensive end DeAngelo Tyson and former safety John Knox.
There were a total of 46 NFL scouts on hand, representing every team with the exception of the Dallas Cowboys and Chicago Bears.


 


The most notable appearance was made by Atlanta Falcons head coach Mike Smith, who has made Georgia’s Pro Day a regular stop since his tenure began in 2008.
“It’s part of the evaluation,” Smith told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution. “Obviously, we spend the majority of our time watching tape and evaluating them. This gives us an opportunity to learn more about how they grew up, what they’ve done and what their make-up is.”
That’s something that White — who sported a Falcons hat during interviews — liked to hear.
“I’d love to be a Falcon,” said White, who gained 10 pounds since the Outback Bowl. “Especially if Tony [Gonzalez] is on that team. That’s a guy I grew up idolizing as my favorite player. ... To me, he’s the greatest tight end of all-time. I would love to take in the wealth of knowledge he has about this position.”
Charles — much like his fellow tight end White — made it clear he’s not focusing solely on the Falcons as a possible destination.
“I would love to play behind Tony Gonzalez, but to tell you the truth, I just want a job right now,” Charles said. “I have no way of helping my mom with bills, no way of eating, so I would love to play for anyone.”
Charles confirmed at least 11 organizations have reached out to him, including the Philadelphia Eagles, a team he said he has set up a private workout with on Thursday.
“I’ve got a couple more, but I’m not really sure,” he said. “I’ve got to sit down with my agent and check it out.”


 


Despite being touted as one of the top tight ends available in April’s draft, Charles was not satisfied with his 40-yard-dash time on Monday after he officially clocked in at 4.75 seconds.
“If I had to take anything back, I would definitely want to run that 40 again to prove that I am a 4.5-4.6 guy,” said Charles, who declined to run the 40 at the Combine. “The wind kind of killed me, so I hope they take that into consideration. It hurt a couple of my times. I felt like I could do a little better.”
But Charles was pleased with the rest of the day’s workouts.
He posted a 30.5 inch vertical jump, a 9.5 foot long jump, a 4.75 second shuttle time and a 4.29 second 3-cone drill time.
He did not participate in bench press, however, since his 35 rep performance led all tight ends at the combine.
But Charles was not the only Bulldog coming off a strong combine.
Glenn garnered praise after finishing in the top 10 in bench press and 40-yard-dash time, with 31 reps and 5.15 seconds, respectively.
“[Being selected in the first round] is my goal,” Glenn said. “I want to be the best, so obviously if you go in the first round, that’s the case. [With the NFL teams], it’s like poker, though. I really have no idea [where I’ll go].”

Walsh also noted that he is unaware of where he’ll wind up.
“I have an idea, but obviously I’d like to keep it under wraps a little bit,” Walsh said. “If you’re not willing to commit a couple years to it, then you’re really just a one-and-done.”
Walsh — who missed 14 field goals last season — took advantage of Pro Day by connecting on 16 of 17 field goal attempts, with the longest coming from 60 yards out.
“I think my career speaks for itself,” said Walsh, who finished with the most points in SEC history. “Obviously, I didn’t have the year I wanted to have this year, but I’m just hoping a team takes a chance because I’m ready to work for them and be [in] a contributing role.”
One player who was not able to contribute much on Monday was Boykin, who only participated in the bench press since he is still recovering from a leg injury he suffered during the Senior Bowl.
“Right now, I’m at 85 percent,” Boykin said. “The timing was terrible, but with the combine and Pro Day, it wasn’t the end-all, be-all. ... I think being the versatile person I am, I kind of have an advantage.”
Boykin tallied 16 reps on bench press, which he believed was a good effort, but it was eight short of Arizona State’s Omar Bolden’s position-leading total.
“I wanted to [get] 18-20 [reps],” Boykin said. “But for a corner, anything above that 14-ish range is pretty good. I’ll probably do it again at my own personal workout.”",Daniel Kramer,sports,https://www.redandblack.com/sports/georgia-draft-prospects-audition-for-nfl-scouts-at-pro-day/article_1a177abc-5d60-5263-a7dd-6f6fba74589d.html
7-Mar-12,Poet finds power in everyday ‘obsessions’,"A poetry reading changed David Wojahn’s life.
“In high school I started getting interested in poetry,” Wojahn said. “After about the age of 16, I just sort of stumbled onto it and it became a life-long passion for me. But when I was in college, the first poetry reading I ever went to was by a Swedish poet named Tomas Tranströmer, and after I saw that reading in 1972, I knew that that’s what I really wanted to do, was be a poet.”
Forty years later, Wojahn is teaching in Virginia Commonwealth University’s English department and still writing poetry.


 


His work runs the gamut, exploring topics from science to history and even popular culture.
“I just think that over the course of time that I’ve written poems, I’ve become increasingly interested in how issues of personal history and public history, autobiography and politics have conjoined and mixed,” Wojahn said. “And that’s become, I think, a concern for me. One of the things that is interesting about poetry is most of us that write poems write from a small number of obsessions. But the trick is to try to find the widest variety of approaches and style with which to approach your obsessions.”
In his latest book, “World Tree,” Wojahn’s “obsessions” include a number of topics that don’t exactly seem poetic: in his poem “In the Attic,” Wojahn writes 42 lines of free verse on linen sport coats and a mustard yellow shirt.
In the same book Wojahn also writes a number of poems on prehistoric cave art, a topic that intrigued University English Professor Jed Rasula.
Rasula is organizer of the Lanier Speaker Series — which provides free public lectures sponsored by the Department of English — and reached out to Wojahn after reading his latest poetry.
“I thought of inviting him when his most recent book, ‘World Tree,’ came out last year,” Rasula said. “It was impressive, and much of it involves Paleolithic cave art — including illustrations — the oldest art preserved anywhere. Some of it dates back almost 40,000 years. I’ve been to many of the caves to see that art, and was impressed with his writing on it.”
Also invited to read at Georgia Tech this week, Wojahn’s varied and unusual subject matter has earned him a small tour-de-Georgia.
Invitations aside, Wojahn does not liken books of poetry to widespread popularity.


 


“There’s a saying that publishing a book of poetry in America is kind of like throwing a rose petal into the Grand Canyon,” he said. “There isn’t a huge audience for poetry. One doesn’t really have very much of an opportunity to make a lot of money — or a living — out of poetry. I think one of the real challenges with poetry in our age is that, even though there’re so many opportunities to publish books and there’s so many people who are poets themselves who also read, poetry doesn’t have the audience, obviously, of popular fiction.”
But for Wojahn it’s about the passion and not the recognition.
He’s working on more poetry, and will be reading poems from “World Tree.”
The spark set by Tranströmer has caught fire.
“The main thing that I want to achieve is to be able to continue to write as long as I’m around,” Wojahn said. “Hopefully, over the course of the time that I’m around, the poetry gets progressively better. One of the great things I find most fascinating about poetry is that the more I’ve done, the more interesting it becomes.”

24-Mar-12,PRACTICE REPORT: 3/24,"Thoughts and observations from the 15-minute portion of football practice the media was permitted to view on Saturday, which marked the fourth day of practice this spring:

Georgia practiced in full pads for the first time this spring after beginning in just helmets before moving into ""shells."" Saturday was also the first time the Bulldogs practiced on their grass surface, as previous sessions have been held on the artificial field turf.


Defensive end Garrison Smith sat out contact drills with what appeared to be a right leg injury. Smith knelt on the sideline while the other defensive linemen went through a cardio drill. He could then be seen hobbling to the next drill before taking a knee again.



 



The Bulldogs' running backs and quarterbacks continued with the simple handoff drills that have been a part of every Georgia practice this week. Isaiah Crowell continued to work almost exclusively with Aaron Murray and with Ken Malcome second in the rotation. Freshman Keith Marshall did, however, take some handoffs from second string quarterback Hutson Mason.


 The Bulldogs continued running an 11-on-11 simple passing drill at the end of open practice. The drill was watched by recruits in attendance as part Georgia's junior day.",Matthew Pearce,sports,https://www.redandblack.com/sports/practice-report/article_d9290416-ad26-50f2-be78-6c4269b77939.html
27-Mar-12,PRACTICE REPORT: 3/27,"Thoughts and observations from the 15-minute portion of football practice the media was permitted to view on Tuesday, which marked the fifth day of practice for Georgia this spring:



The offense ran a lot of no-huddle drills, something Georgia had success with in 2011. Quarterback Aaron Murray seemed comfortable and confident while doing so. He did a great job of keeping the rest of the first-team active in getting back to the line. Once there, he employed a lot of motion plays that faked out potential defenders –– the blocking receiver ran the opposite direction of the running back.



 



The second team –– as somewhat expected –– looked much smaller and slower. The coordination getting back to the huddle was not nearly as fluid as the first team and receivers coach Tony Ball repeatedly emphasized “power” to the blockers throughout.


The running backs conducted business as usual, with the exception of Richard Samuel, who last week sported a green jersey reserved for non-contact players. Tuesday he was in a red uniform. Keith Marshall made some average catches out of the backfield, but nothing spectacular like last week. Running backs coach Bryan McClendon emphasized “wider” to Marshall when trying to break away down the sideline.


Three cornerbacks stood out from the rest –– Branden Smith, Blake Sailors and Malcolm Mitchell –– which is coincidentally the order they lined up in. All three had spectacular footwork and no corner dropped a ball in the first set of reps. Smith looked fastest, though Mitchell, the Bulldogs' second-leading receiver in 2011, closely followed.


The inside linebackers were running cone drills that concluded with a pass thrown at them. Christian Robinson lined up first, followed by Michael Gilliard, Alec Ogletree, Brandon Burrows, Amarlo Herrera and Kosta Vavlas. Ogletree looked the most impressive. His footwork was fabulous and he snagged one ball thrown at his face mask. The coaches seemed cautious when working with Herrera, who had a brace on his right wrist, though it appears much smaller than the one he wore last week.


Towards the end of the media-viewing session, both the offensive and defensive lineman were going against each other. It was the only drill that incorporated players on both sides during the media-allotted portion of practice. Abry Jones was the standout, taking down Austin Long on one play with relative ease.


Head coach Mark Richt stood in between the two fields at the Woodruff practice facility, speaking with what appeared to be potential recruits. He kept an eye on the passing drills Murray was orchestrating, though his focus seemed to be with those whom he was speaking with.


The highlight of practice the appearance of Hines Ward, a former Super Bowl MVP. Ward –– who dressed in Georgia coaching attire –– announced his retirement from the NFL on March 20.",Daniel Kramer,sports,https://www.redandblack.com/sports/practice-report/article_e8a671c5-3d9d-5747-8aa4-cf9e4ee2dd15.html
30-Mar-12,Four piece ‘pretty excited’ to return to Athens,"Tent City is coming home — sort of.
“We haven’t played in Athens in 2012 so far, so this is going to be our first hometown show of the new year,” said guitarist Greg Kearney. “We’re pretty excited.”
Tent City has been together for three years. While its members — including Kearney, Greg Cooler on bass, Logan Wallis on keyboards and Mike Strickland on drums — originated in Statesboro, they chose to move to Athens shortly after forming.


 


Tent City is an entirely instrumental band that plays within the genres of blues, jazz and funk.
“I’m a big fan of The Allman Brothers,” Kearney said. “I also dig a little deeper, back to who influenced them, all the way down to Robert Johnson.”
Tent City’s show in Athens will be at the after -party for the North Mississippi Allstars’ show at the Georgia Theatre.
The band is no stranger to big-name guest musicians sitting in with them, having done a set with Chuck Leavell at Nowhere last year, and hope that this show could produce a similar jam.
“I’ve already shot their management an email to send them an invitation to come over and sit in,” Kearney said. “We’re keeping our fingers crossed.”
Tent City has received rave reviews for its live shows in the past, being particularly well-received for high energy and genre infusion.
The band is continuing to book shows throughout the summer, but remains particularly excited for the return to the Athens scene.
“Tickets are going to be $3 at the door,” Kearney said, “so come on and put some boogie in your socks.”

6-Apr-12,Bulldogs Have Strong Opening Day At Florida Relays,"GAINESVILLE, Fla. --- Bulldog senior steeplechaser Matt Cleaver finished with the country’s fastest time in his event to pace Georgia during the first day of action at the Florida Relays in Gainesville, Fla., on Friday.
“It got kind of tough later in the day with windy conditions as a cold front moved in,” Georgia assistant coach Jon Stuart said.  “But there was some strong competition out there today and I think our teams elevated their performances and stepped up.  Some of our best are starting to step up so that’s a good sign.  We are looking for big things (on Saturday).”
Cleaver, the defending Southeastern Conference champion in the 3000-meter steeplechase, won his second straight race with a national-leading time.  Cleaver recorded a time of 8:49.38 to pick up a 10-second victory and come within four seconds of his career best in the steeplechase.


 


Sophomore Megan Malasarte ran her first 800 of the outdoor season and finished with the third-best time in school history.  Malasarte clocked a 2:06.05 to be the top collegiate finisher (second overall) and move to No. 5 on the national performance list.
Junior Leslie Boozer improved her own No. 3 time in school history in the women’s steeplechase.  After registering a personal-best 10:24.84 at last year’s NCAA East Regionals, Boozer was the runner-up on Friday night after completing the course in 10:24.15.  This is the seventh-fastest time in the nation this year.
Savannah Kirk bettered her No. 9 time in the school record books to 10:55.52 for 11th place in the event.
While his teammate and SEC leader Brian Moore took the weekend off, sophomore Braydon Anderson watched his second throw travel a personal-best 222-5 for third place.  Anderson moved from 10th to ninth on the Georgia all-time top-10 list.
Senior Torrin Lawrence made his season debut and managed to move to fifth on the all-time top-10 list for UGA in the 200.  Lawrence, who won the 2009 SEC indoor 200 crown, clocked a career-best 20.51 to finish seventh.
In the women’s discus Invite, sophomore Hilenn James had the second-best performance of her career to take third.  James lifted her opening attempt 169-7 before suffering five consecutive fouls.
Fellow senior sprinter Phillip Adams continued to drop his season best time in the 400 hurdles to take seventh.  Adams completed his lap in 51.22 and moved into the top 15 nationally.

10-Apr-12,"University football player named ""Gentleman of the Year""","The annual Gentlemen’s Showcase is a contest hosted by the Network of Enlightened Women — a conservative women’s book club. NeW believes the decline of chivalry leads to “mutual disrespect” between the sexes. The national organization hosts the showcase each year in an attempt to promote gentlemanly behavior and to prove that chivalry is not yet extinct, according to the organization’s website.
Each chapter nominates an individual who they believe best exemplifies gentlemanly behavior. Chapters nominate their gentlemen by posting a video, picture or note explaining why their candidate deserved to win “Gentleman of the Year.”
The candidate with the most “likes” on Facebook from March 1 until March 31 won the contest.


 


“The whole idea of the Gentlemen’s showcase is that ... we do believe that chivalry still exists,” founder of the UGA chapter of NeW Louise Cook said. “It’s the whole idea of highlighting guys out there that are gentlemen – not tearing men down. They’re not all horrible and scumbags. There are some really great guys out there.”
In March vice president Taylor Ayres nominated freshman tight end Jack Loonam to represent the University's brand new chapter in the national Gentlemen’s showcase.
“We had no idea what to expect,” Ayres said. “We had no idea how many people were even nominated.”
Jack is a freshman football player as well as an ROTC cadet. Ayres nominated him, she said, because of his sweet disposition and upstanding morals.
“He was confident and I really respect that he seems like a man of integrity,” Ayres said. “He’s on the football team and an ROTC cadet and in the midst of all that he was just the type of guy that I think people need to see.”
Still, club officers were surprised at how quickly Loonam took the lead in this competition, said Ayres.
“He got 300 votes in the first five days,” she said. “And then as the event went on and other chapters started nominating kids – they weren’t getting the same votes that Jack was getting. We kept looking at each other in disbelief.”
Loonam won the title with a total of 385 votes, Ayers approximated.


 


The nomination came as a welcome honor to Loonam, he said.
“When I got nominated, I felt really honored, of course.” he said. “I always I want to leave a good impression on people because it’s tough to find that today.”
Loonam won a night out with a date as well as national recognition as “Gentleman of the Year.” His win will also ensure that the UGA chapter of NeW will be mentioned at the national meeting.
Cook said she hopes the mention will bring greater publicity to the chapter – which only hosts about 10 permanent members, she said.
Cook founded the UGA chapter of NeW just this past January after becoming inspired by her sister’s initiative to begin a chapter at Vanderbilt. The pair attended the annual NeW conference last summer in D.C. and came to agree with the views of the organization.
“I think there are a lot of girls out there that have conservative values and can’t really stand firm in their beliefs because it’s not the norm anymore,” Cook said. “So NeW sort of offers a new way of thinking – no pun intended – for university women who feel uneasy and don’t actually like this crazy culture, but don’t know where to find an outlet.”
NeW typically meets at Jittery Joes around 8 p.m. on most Tuesday evenings, Cook said, although meeting times do vary depending on the group members’ schedules.",Cailin O'brien,news,https://www.redandblack.com/news/university-football-player-named-gentleman-of-the-year/article_e856144a-ea9a-50e7-906f-61c2722703c8.html
11-Apr-12,Tight end dubbed ‘Gentleman of the Year’,"Jack Loonam is a new age gentleman.
Winner of the Network of Enlightened Women’s 2012 “Gentleman of the Year,” Loonam owes thanks to his cell phone for his Gentleman’s Showcase nomination.
It all started on an Orbit bus — where Loonam, a freshman tight end, stood among the crowd, grabbing the support railing with each brake.


 


And at one of the stops, he looked up to see a seated male student watch a girl get on board.
“I saw some girl get on a full bus,” Loonam said. “Not exactly the best looking girl, if you know what I mean, but she looked nice.  And she kind of looks at the guy to see if he would give up his seat and he looks at her and looks down. So she has to stand up, and at the next bus stop, a really pretty girl gets on the bus and he gives up his seat to her.”
Shocked, Loonam took out his phone and vented his frustration to the cyber world of Twitter and Facebook: “Bro, when a girl is standing up on the bus, give her your seat, no matter what she looks like, its the right thing to do. Be a gentleman[.]”
His manners went viral.
In two hours, the Facebook status had almost 70 “likes” on it.
“It was mostly girls, and people I kind of knew,” Loonam said. “You know those friends you have on Facebook but you rarely ever interact with them? And it got re-tweeted like 10 times.”
One person who noticed was Taylor Ayres, vice president of the University’s NeW Chapter.
She said she was struck by Loonam’s graciousness and generosity when they first met at a sorority dinner, but the catalyst that put him on her gentleman radar was his Facebook status.


 


“I thought it was pretty cool how he put it on the table,” Ayres said. “He was like, ‘Guys, you should always give up your seat for a girl.’ And I definitely respected how he was able to call out the male seated.”
Ayres nominated Loonam for the Gentleman’s Showcase, and the electronic “likes” kept coming.
Ayres defines a gentleman as a guy who is always considerate and respectful. However, the showcase itself didn’t have defined criteria for what constitutes a true gentleman.
“There’s a number of ways to define it,” said Karin Agness, NeW’s founder and president of eight years. “NeW doesn’t have a concrete definition of a gentleman.”
But Loonam fit the bill. And his Facebook and Twitter earned a spotlight from “the nation’s premier organization for conservative university women.”
“I got like 400 ‘likes’ on a picture in a month,” Loonam said. “That’s how the wining was [determined], if you ‘liked’ the picture on Facebook.”
The seeming contradiction of awarding men, Agness said, furthers NeW’s goals.
“Unfortunately, too often on campuses, people think that the way to praise women is to put down men,” she said. “We think it’s important to praise those men who treat women with respect on campus. By doing so, both men and women benefit.”


TNCMS.AdManager.render({region: 'fixed-big-ad-bottom-asset', slot: 1, fold: ""below""});


Ayres said supporting gallantry is one way to foster this culture of respect.
“I think keeping chivalry alive is important because it really encourages respect between the sexes,” she said. “There’s this idea that women can do anything that men can do, and that’s true up to an extent. But at some point women have to say, ‘You know what, I can’t lift this 400-pound car.’”
Loonam didn’t have to display any feats of strength — but he does abstain from smoking and drinking.
“Doing the right thing may not feel good at the time, but it’s what you’ve got to do,” he said. “Even if you’re one of the only people not doing it, you know it’s wrong or if it’s illegal you shouldn’t be doing it.”
The values were instilled in him, he said, through religion, his parents, his ROTC training and his tight end coach John Lilly.
That combination of influences has helped cultivate Loonam’s own idea of a gentleman.
“It’s not really doing the right thing for girls,” he said. “But just being a good guy and person. Even holding a door for like — if a guy’s coming in, and you can tell if he’s busy or has to go somewhere — you hold the door for a guy, not just for a girl. Being a gentleman is not just for one [sex]. It’s being that all the time.”
Loonam is happy to receive the award, even though there’s no financial reward.

The University NeW women might take him out to eat though, he said — their treat.
“It’s one of the most humbling things I’ve ever gotten,” he said. “I felt so humbled that I actually had that kind of impression on people, because I thought it was just the right thing to do. Being the good guy — for once — actually paid off.”",Sydney Kida,variety,https://www.redandblack.com/variety/tight-end-dubbed-gentleman-of-the-year/article_f20f7eed-bb04-5acf-8361-5a736b22c76b.html
24-Apr-12,‘Funky’ group gets audience up and moving,"Sol Driven Train is like a musical dress-up box. Most of its songs are eccentric, and not one of its songs sounds like the preceding tune.
The song “Watermelon” on the “Watermelon” album opens with a funky, soulful sound. But careful attention to the lyrics reveals that the tune is truly just about a seasonal fruit.
Lyrics such as “you’re only here/Four months of the year/And then you disappear to the southern hemisphere” take some of that sultry edge out of the sound itself.


 


The band’s singer and guitarist, Joel Timmons, said Sol Driven Train’s tunes get a little less silly on its latest album, “Underdog.”
“The mood [of ‘Underdog’] is like a hopeful sort of album,” he said. “Whereas ‘Watermelon’ was kind of light and quirky.”
It’s hard to guess which hat the group will don for its performance at The Melting Point, but the venue’s booking agent Troy Aubrey said Sol Driven Train impressed him last time it was in town.
“They actually played here back in February on Fat Tuesday opening for Tab Benoit,” he said. “They caught everyone off guard in my opinion, as they were pretty amazing.”
Aubrey cited the band’s energy as the characteristic that made the show.
And Sol Driven Train’s traveling groupies helped with the electricity of the Mardi Gras mood.
“There was a large group of people that came specifically to see Sol Driven Train from Sautee Nacoochee,” Aubrey said. “I have a feeling that they’ll all be back for this show. They got the whole place up and dancing.”
With its playful lyrics and infatuated fans, Sol Driven Train holds the promise of an amusing show.


 


It’s the joy of songwriting and performing that the band is after, Timmons said.
“We want to keep writing and recording,” he said. “We don’t really have grand visions of super stardom, but it would be nice to be kind of like a musical middle class.”
If the show is anything like the band’s albums, concertgoers can expect a variety of colorful tunes at the show.
“Folks should come to see this band as they’re great live,” Aubrey said. “[They’re] funky, humorous and superbly talented musicians.”

26-Apr-12,Play provides thought for death penalty themes,"“Burning Man” is not just a play — it’s a conversation starter.
A major capital punishment case coincides with the city’s annual Burning Man festival in Black Rock City, Nev. Tension builds as the festival progresses and the characters each explore their different thoughts on the death penalty in the hours leading up to the trial verdict.
Although the play is occasionally humorous, it also explores many sides of a complicated, topical issue.


 


“When we were looking for new plays, we had submissions from all over the country, actually,” said Joelle Re’ Arp-Dunham, producing artistic director for the Circle Ensemble Theatre Company. “It just kept coming back to my head after I read it — I just kept thinking about it and comparing everything else to it. That’s the kind of theatre we like to do, things that will make you think about things and make you contemplate yourself and what your own values are.”
Playwright Pamela Turner wanted to explore the idea of who owns death in the play.
“I have mixed feelings on the death penalty myself,” she said. “I think it’s a conversation we all need to be having.”
The politically charged content of the play is challenging for actors who don’t share the same views, Re’ Arp-Dunham said, as the actors play positions that they have never found themselves in morally.
Re’ Arp-Dunham said that the disparity in belief systems is tough, especially for actors more accustomed to playing naturalistic roles.
“I’m playing the wife of the murdered man, Sarah Claire,” said Lisa Mende, executive director of Circle Ensemble. “She is a woman who has been victimized who doesn’t really want to see herself as a victim. And she’s opposed to the execution of the man who murdered her husband because she’s trying to find compassion within herself… She has a line that says, ‘I’m afraid of who I am if I want him to die.’ And I think that kind of encapsulates how she feels about the execution of the murderer of her husband.”
Another challenging task includes recreating an effigy of a burning man on stage.
“We have to build the burning man on stage during the performance,” Re’ Arp-Dunham said. “There’s a technical challenge there, definitely. We’re trying to build a full, huge sculpture on stage in the middle of a performance.”


 


Turner said her work is very visual, and that she’s known for her impossible stage directions.
But the technical and mental challenges of the play all culminate to make the audience contemplate a tough issue, fueling small fires of debate concerning capital punishment.
“It’s a wonderful piece,” Mende said. “One of the nice things about it is that it really lets the viewer come to their own conclusion. It’s not preachy. It doesn’t say the death penalty is right or the death penalty is wrong, but it points at all of our frailties.”

28-Apr-12,Presidential election reflects French politics,"This past Sunday was the first round of the French presidential elections.
It wasn’t much of a media event for the United States — probably because it coincides with our own election season — but that doesn’t mean they’re irrlevant.
Incumbent president Nicholas Sarkozy has struggled in his approval ratings. His main challenger is center-left Socialist nominee François Hollande. Other major contenders include Marine Le Pen of the far-right National Front, Jean-Luc Mélenchon of the far-left Left Front and François Bayrou of the centrist Democratic Movement. Hollande won the first round of voting, beating Sarkozy 28.6 percent to 27.2 percent. Per French election protocol, they will face off in the May 6 runoff election.


 


But why care? In light of economic difficulties, the French elections offer an instructive lens through which to view our own elections in November. France, like many of the Eurozone countries, has been entrenched in a debt crisis and has made tough choices in the quickly fading zeitgeist of austerity.
Credit rating agency Standard & Poor’s downgraded France’s credit in January to AA+ from AAA. S&P downgraded the U.S. credit rating last summer following the contentious debt deal, causing volatility in the markets and a drop in President Barack Obama’s approval ratings. One can imagine, then, that Sarkozy would be in the hot seat following S&P’s January downgrade.
Sarkozy, as the incumbent, doesn’t have any particularly radical or surprising planks. He’s taken France through rough times and made tough decisions, but his domestic policies and his close relationship with German chancellor Angela Merkel have been in the best interest of France. Sarkozy’s pitch to stay the course is unsurprising. But what I find more interesting are the platforms of the other candidates. If Sarkozy is losing steam, then what do French voters prefer?
Hollande has criticized the Eurozone fiscal pact signed by Sarkozy and 24 other EU leaders in January. Hollande contends the pact focuses too much on austerity and too little on job growth. He intends to renegotiate the pact. His fiscal plan also includes a 45 percent tax rate on income above 150,000 Euros and a 75 percent tax rate on income above 1 million Euros.
Mélenchon, the far-left ex-Communist, campaigned on raising the minimum wage by 20 percent and creating a 100 percent tax rate on all income over 360,000 Euros. He, too, has shown strong disdain for the January Eurozone fiscal pact.
Far-right Marine Le Pen joined the nationalist carousel to criticize the Eurozone fiscal pact. She also took pot shots at the rich, though she hasn’t advocated confiscatory rates as did Hollande and Mélenchon. She also ran on xenophobic nationalism. Le Pen criticized Sarkozy for not being anti-immigrant enough.
Clearly, nationalist rhetoric was popular in France this year. It’s a sad reflection of political reality: blaming someone else often works. For France, the bogeyman is either Germany or the EU — or both. It’s their version of blaming George Bush.
The United States, like Europe, has a plethora of economic issues. Bogeymen abound — some more deserving than others — but I implore our leadership to level with us and tackle our fiscal issues seriously in this election year. Shedding responsibility in favor of nationalism will only worsen our woes.

An officer on Barnett Shoals Road was notified of another officer following a possibly drunk driver coming his direction. The other officer initiated the traffic stop for failure to maintain lane and the second officer met the car and ""took over the investigation,"" according to the report.
Sullenberger said she did not think she had been swerving, but she said she had ""stopped for her drunk passenger to throw up,"" according to the report. The officer smelled a strong odor of alcohol coming from the vehicle and had Sullenberger step out of the car.


 


She said she had been working an event at Terrapin and had one beer, but declined a breathalyzer test. She agreed to field sobriety tests ""to make sure she was OK to drive.""
She started the tests too soon and put her foot down while attempting to complete the one-leg stand, according to the report. The officer asked again if she'd like to take a breathalyzer and she said no.
Sullenberger was placed under arrest and agreed to the state blood test. She was transported to Athens Regional Medical Center and had her blood drawn at 1:40 a.m. She was then transported to Clarke County Jail.",Megan Ernst,news,https://www.redandblack.com/news/graduate-research-assistant-charged-with-dui/article_9c8d4e66-ddc5-5d3a-804d-0018d45768bd.html
30-Apr-12,Bikers tour farms and food throughout Georgia,"One hundred miles. Eight farms. Three days.
Cyclists and food enthusiasts will bike 100 miles, visiting about two to three farms a day throughout Georgia on Memorial Day weekend.
Promoting Local Agriculture & Cultural Experience will host this year's Tour de Farm.


 


""I worked with Craig Page, who was executive director of P.L.A.C.E.,"" said Erin Sanders, coordinator of Tour de Farm and P.L.A.C.E. board member. ""I worked with him at Espresso Royale. I planned last year's Tour de Farm. Craig knew that I was a cyclist. He knew that I was involved in the bike scene. He also knew that I was interested in local food.""
Timing ensures the event's success. Sanders said the holiday weekend provides space looking to participate in the tour.
""It was nice to have it on Memorial Day weekend because people already had the Monday off,"" Sanders said. ""In the spring, farmers have more produce. It provided a better experience and gave a sense of what's in season. [The food has] been picked right before we get there.""
Education plays a part in the event, connecting people to their food from field to table, Sanders said.
The bikers break their destination down into approximately 30 miles a day with periodic stops.
""At each farm, we stopped and toured the farm and had a snack or full meal,"" Sanders said. ""Every meal is covered on the tour. We try to buy as much food as possible from the farm that we can.""
Other Athenian businesses and chefs participate in the event, as well.
In 2011, Espresso Royale donated granola and other snacks, Athens Locally Grown donated food and Luna Bakery provided bread.


 


Jittery Joe's Coffee, sponsor of a previous Tour de Farm and avid supporter of cycling, provided coffee.
""We gave them coffee to brew and we gave them some cans for prizes,"" said Charlie Mustard, roast master of Jittery Joe's Coffee. ""We made sure they were direct trade coffees.""
The donated coffee blended Nicaraguan Matagalpa coffee from the Selva Negra farm — which possessed Rainforest Alliance Certification — and Brazilian Bob-o-link coffee. Bob-o-link's coffee is named after a migratory bird which travels from Chicago to the  company's Brazilian farm every year.
""The farm had turned over to a mass production farm which cut down all the trees,"" Mustard said. ""[The owner] scaled the farm back and planted the trees for the birds' habitat. Next year, he'll be RFA certified.""
More than finding place with its participants, the mission also resonates with sponsors.
""We've been delivering coffee on bike ever since we started,"" Mustard said. ""We had a professional cycling team for 10 years and that was how we created the Morning Ride blend. We really try to push cycling. Christian and I ride into work everyday.""
Sales of Jittery Joe's Alternative Fuel coffee at the Last Resort Grill benefits BikeAthens, another sponsor of the cycling expedition.
""They helped promote it last year and a mechanic came who fixed flats,"" Sanders said. ""As part of their sponsorship, they sent a mechanic, who rides along free of charge in exchange for the bike maintenance.""

Chefs also participate in the event, exercising their culinary feats. Christopher McCook of Athens Country Club and Peter Dale of The National were two of many cooks who created a meal for the group.
""The National was also a sponsor,"" Sanders said. ""Peter Dale came out on Sunday night on Sundance Farm. He made a chicken panzanella that is still in my mind from a year ago. He's very gracious and supportive of what P.L.A.C.E. does.""
Although the course tests physical limits, the experience merits every mile.
""It's a really nice opportunity to meet the farmers,"" Sanders said. ""It's a good way to see how things are done. It's a nice way to get some exercise, meet great, wonderful people, eat some really,really good, fresh food and experience a little more of the Athens community.""

11-May-12,"U.S. Army general tells ROTC students ""you're ready"" at commissioning ceremony","ROTC members received encouragement for leadership and dedication from a U.S. Army general today during the University commissioning ceremony.
Lt. General Vincent K. Brooks, commanding general of Third Army and the Army component of the United States Central Command, addressed students and faculty during the Bulldog Battalion Commissioning Ceremony.
Brooks took command of the Third Army and Army Forces Central in the summer of 2011, which supports operations in Afghanistan and also participates in diplomacy with other countries, according to the ceremony's press release.


 


The commissioning ceremony celebrated graduating ROTC members as they move from the rank of cadet to second lieutenant. Brooks emphasized the newly commissioned lieutenants leadership roles and the influence they would play in shaping the Army moving forward.
""To be able to take a pause for the cause and pass on something to the next generation — for sure, I'm going to pass on an oath and office. But I hope that in a few minutes of time I'll pass on a few more things that might stick with you as you begin your journey,"" Brooks said. ""Now you are all about to become lieutenants in the United States Army, which will certainly put you on a common level. And you might think 'Yeah, it's the lowest level.' But it's a starting point.""
Brooks said he was delighted to speak to the graduating class and appreciated the University for supporting students who chose to participate in ROTC.
""It's a high honor,"" he said. ""It seems like a small thing for a general to come hang out with lieutenants, but it's a tremendous honor to be speak with the next generation. And because of what it is that the University of Georgia does for this department it is possible for us to have University of Georgia graduates wearing the United States flag on their shoulder and the United States Army on their chests but the University of Georgia is inside of their hearts.""
Fourteen commissioned officers were pinned by friends and family members and celebrated their first salute. Some students will be sent to active duty while other graduates will spend months after graduating waiting to be called.
Matthew Lustig, a biology major from Berkeley Lake, has been assigned to the Army Reserves and will be studying medicine in Augusta until he is called to active service.
""I've always wanted to be a doctor and the Army came after me,"" he said. ""I can't think of a better way to serve people than to be a doctor and the same thing goes for the Army. We've been working for years — some of us two years, some of us four. So it's great to be at the final moment.""
Other commissioned students included Slade Barron of Dalton, David Campbell of Lawrenceville, Nicholas Coleman of Dacula, Collin deCamp of Charlottesville, Va., Christopher Farran of Grand Rapids, Mich., Stephen Hanley of Lawrenceville, Christopher Iannacone of Lawrenceville, Aaron Mathys of Kabetogama Lake, Minn., Graham Painter of Hull, Benjamin Pereski of Ringgold, Angela Pocta of Augusta, Nicholas Trevena of Peachtree City and Austen Turner of Cartersville.


 


Brooks told the graduating class though they may have reservations about moving forward into their Army careers, they should be reassured in knowing they would be some of the best prepared among their companies.
""As you look forward to the uncertainty of the future, you're not sure what's waiting for you out there,"" Brooks said. ""You don't know exactly what that Army is that you've studied for and prepared for but I can tell you this is an experienced army. It's an extraordinary army. It's an army that needs your leadership — and you're ready.""",Tiffany Stevens,news,https://www.redandblack.com/news/u-s-army-general-tells-rotc-students-you-re-ready/article_94acee27-e8ba-52cf-9c0e-696309cab6db.html

30-May-12,Alumni Associations host blood drives in former Univ. student Aimee Copeland’s name,"Aimee Copeland, a University graduate who developed necrotizing fasciitis, a flesh-eating bacterial disease, has been facing trials and tribulations during her hospitalization.
Since her fall from a homemade zip line over a west Georgia river, 24-year-old Copeland has lost her left leg, right foot and both of her hands.
And now her need for blood is higher than ever.


 


To push for more participation, the University’s Alumni Association, in conjunction with the University of South Carolina’s My Carolina Alumni Association, will host a nationwide “Border Bash” blood drive for Copeland.
While Columbia, S.C. will host a June 11 drive, a June 13 blood drive has been set up in Athens at Memorial Hall from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. and at Reed Hall from 2 p.m. to 7 p.m. The drive, which has a goal of 100 units of blood, was set up by the University’s Alumni Association, Students for the American Red Cross and the Department of University Housing.
An additional drive will be held June 5 on the fourth floor of the Rusk Center from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. where students, faculty and staff can donate blood to and write cards for Copeland.
Graduates and students from both institutions are encouraged to give at any blood donation center in contribution to Copeland from June 11-15.
The University’s Alumni Association is working to make a competition of how many units of blood each institution can raise.
Copeland, who is in critical condition in the Joseph M. Still Burn Center at Doctors Hospital in Augusta, has had her medical updates posted on social media networks by her father Andy Copeland, a USC graduate. And his enthusiasm for this particular project has shown through.
“God bless USC and UGA! Gamecocks and Bulldogs lead the charge!” he posted on Facebook.
Aimee Copeland has been through 200 units of blood products — including red blood cells and fresh frozen plasma — as of Monday, according to Andy Copeland.


 


The My Carolina Alumni Association told the Associated Press that burn and wound patients go through more units of blood than any other patients.
With one patient needing 200 units of blood in a burn unit of over 70 beds, the need for blood is high.
“While Aimee has been at Doctors for about four weeks, some patients have been there for six months,” Andy Copeland said in a statement announcing the drive. “After each surgery, these patients require additional units of blood.”",A.J.

16-Jun-12,Mark Richt Camp concludes final session,"The final day of the Mark Richt Camp took place Saturday as high school football players and college prospects met at the Georgia practice fields to engage face-to-face with some of Georgia's top coaches.
Among the highest-regarded prospects of the 2013 recruiting class expected at the event were the No. 2 and No. 3 players in the nation, linebacker Reuben Foster and offensive tackle Laremy Tunsil, according to ESPN's Kipp Adams.
Foster is a 6-foot-1, 250 pound five-star prospect from Auburn High School in Auburn, Al.


 


Tunsil is a 6-foot-6, 295 pound five-star prospect from Colombus High School in Lake City, Fla. 
Observations from part of the camp made available to the media:

Georgia offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach Mike Bobo led the signal-callers through drills designed to test their agility and ability to throw under duress.
When one player was holding the ball too low, Bobo shouted to ""hold the ball up higher."" When the player seemed uncertain of what he meant, Bobo threw his hands up in the air and said, ""Have you ever played quarterback before? Has anyone — your high school coach —taught you to play quarterback?""
Georgia wide receivers coach Tony Ball put the receivers through a comprehensive route tree, including one drill where receivers were required to take a 'slant' route and catch the ball between two dummies.
When players started to shy away from the ball at the end of their route, Ball said that they had to attack it or the defensive back would rip it out. To illustrate his point, Ball grabbed one of the rubber bats and proceeded to strike the ball out of players' hands if they didn't hold on to it tight enough.
The running backs were taken through a series of drills meant to test their agility and cutting ability. Such drills included break-down cuts, spinning, running slant routes and cone drills.

The final day of the event included an early practice, a flex workout and then lunch, followed by another practice before wrapping things up around 4 p.m.",NICHOLAS FOURIEZOS,sports,https://www.redandblack.com/sports/mark-richt-camp-concludes-final-session/article_e913e91e-b7bf-11e1-b16e-001a4bcf6878.html
24-Jun-12,Former Bulldog All-American Reese Hoffa Olympics-Bound With Trials Win,"Former Georgia thrower Reese Hoffa launched a world-leading mark in the shot put to win the U.S. Olympic Trials and clinch a spot to his third straight Olympics at the University of Oregon’s Hayward Field on Sunday.
Hoffa, a five-time All-American for the Bulldogs from 1998-2001, let go of a 72 feet, 2 ¼ inch effort on his third attempt to top second-place finisher Ryan Whiting (71-0.75) by more than a foot.  Christian Cantwell (69-9.75) took third and will join Hoffa and Whiting as the U.S. contingent in the shot put during the Games in London.
Hoffa, an Augusta native, won the 2008 Trials before finishing seventh at the 2008 Games in Beijing.  He is the second former Bulldog to clinch a spot in the Olympics in the last week.  Competing for the Bulldogs during the 2000 season, Kibwe Johnson won the hammer throw at the Trials in Beaverton, Ore., on Thursday.  He already had an “A” standard mark and will now be competing at his first Olympics.


 


Georgia also had freshman Morgann Leleux and former Lady Bulldog Kat Majester compete in the women’s pole vault on Sunday.  Majester cleared her first two heights on opening attempts, including a career-best height of 14-5.25 to take fifth.
Leleux, who was the runner-up at both the NCAA indoor and outdoor meets and the 2012 Southeastern Conference outdoor champion, tied for 13th after reaching a height of 13-11.25.

28-Jun-12,"UGA College of Public Health reacts to Supreme Court healthcare ruling, praise protection of preventative health","Officials from the University College of Public Health provided reactions to the Affordable Care Act ruling from the Supreme Court a statement early Thursday, with initial thoughts from Phaedra Corso, department head of health promotion and behavior.
Corso emphasized the importance of prevention, Medicaid expansion and health insurance exchanges in her statement.
""From a public health standpoint, the important public health provisions of the Affordable Care Act will remain in place, and that’s good news for preventative care,"" Corso said in a statement.


 


The same statement included thoughts from Toni Miles, director of the University Institute of Gerontology.
Miles cautioned against states panicking in wake of the ruling, emphasizing the states' power to choose whether or not to fully participate in the expansion.
“They can’t be penalized for participating, and that’s what state governments were worried about,"" Miles said. ""They can’t run in red ink.""
Corso pointed to slow movement in the Georgia General Assembly as reasons behind this ""key challenge for us in 2013.""
""Even if we pass legislation next session, we’ll have only six months to get it up and running,"" she said. ""If we’re unable to do so, then the federal government will have to come in to set up and manage the exchange, so that’s a really big deal.”
In the statement, Miles said her main concern is for the ""vulnerable"" population of Georgians living below the poverty line — who she said will benefit from the expansion in Medicaid provided for by the ACA ruling.
Miles said nearly 50 percent of Georgian families with children born in the U.S. need Medicaid assistance for maternity bills.
""Because the state doesn’t shell out those dollars, they’ll have more flexibility covering people on the other end of life who need long-term care,"" she said. ""Medicaid is the only insurance program we have that’s cradle to grave. This is great for seniors and young families. We protect the future and honor the past.”

4-Jul-12,Ex-Bulldog Reese Hoffa enters third Olympics (w/video),"They don't make characters like this.
Reese Hoffa, a former Bulldog and soon-to-be three-time Olympian, wears a fuzzy red headband that proudly displays his affiliation with the Georgia program.
""I'm still going strong. I didn't really expect to be throwing this long. I thought I'd be in a coaching position somewhere, but I guess that's not the plan,"" Hoffa said. ""[Plan is] to get another Olympics.""


 


The summer heat reins in around him, but he focuses on the task at hand — the 16-pound metal ball, balanced carefully in his meaty hands.
His right cheek is covered in chalk, his shirtless body straining as he begins to spin, and then releases the shot put into the air.
It's only a practice shot, but it's the beginning of something far longer in the making — a capstone to a career, as Hoffa sees his professional years finally winding down to an end.
""I will get the grandpa tag in terms of shut putting,"" the 34-year-old veteran said. ""I am the old fogey, 'take down that music kids, I gotta go to sleep!""

The event suits him as a farewell performance, since it is the only international meet that he has never medaled in, despite a career that included Hoffa becoming one of only two men to throw 69-feet over 100 times in the history of the sport.
""Hundreds of thousands of times I've dreamed about standing on the Olympic stand,"" Hoffa said. ""I always envision myself inning and until that becomes a reality, it's just play.""
But even if he shouldn't fulfill that dream, Hoffa will have been proud of what he has accomplished.


 


""I really like the way my professional career has gone,"" Hoffa said. ""I've kept my nose clean for the better part of 11 years and I've gained a lot of respect from not only people in my sport, but in the rest of the disciplines too — people know who the name of Hoffa is.""
Don't expect him to not enjoy himself though — there are many pleasures that even an Olympic athlete can treat himself to, especially with a host as accommodating as the city of London.
""London, if there ever was a place in your Olympic dream career, I couldn't think of a better place,"" Hoffa said. ""They're my kind of people — beer drinking, fatty-food eating people. You just can't beat that. China, eh, everyone is so small — they love big people, because they never see it.""
And whatever happens, keep him away from the Twizzlers.
""Twizzlers are my kryptonite,"" Hoffa said. ""Twizzlers and Skittles are my two favorite candies, and unfortunately, those are the two most prevalent candies you will find in our athletic hospitality areas. Just a gigantic jug of Twizzlers, and I can't hesitate but take a handful, which is the equivalent of a family size of Twizzlers — I'm in trouble.""
The laughing, the fun, the games — they're all natural to an Olympian who has already come to terms with his career, and who is focused on enjoying the ride, rather than missing it.
""Just don't mess up, that's the first thing,"" Hoffa said. ""Second thing, just have fun with it. I'm going to walk and try to enjoy as much of the Olympics as I can, because I kind of know, I'm not going to get another chance to do this.""
And if he gets that final, elusive medal, fine. But if not, Hoffa doesn't mind — he has already discovered his legacy.

""I've put together three Olympic games — you put that on any resume, people have got to look at that with a level of respect,"" Hoffa said. ""Probably a lot of people that have made one, but to make three — that's amazing...that's where the story begins.""
So when he joins the opening ceremonies of the London games, Hoffa won't be worried. In fact, he'll be pulling up a chair and enjoying the view as best as he can.
""Well, it's going to effect me — I'm actually buying a chair, so that I won't have to stand as much when I walk,"" Hoffa said. ""Then the next time I step in the ring, it's game time, it's championship week.""",NICHOLAS FOURIEZOS,sports,https://www.redandblack.com/sports/ex-bulldog-reese-hoffa-enters-third-olympics-w-video/article_18567ccc-c5f9-11e1-b3e7-0019bb30f31a.html
23-Aug-12,UGA misses the cut for top 25 in Hispanics graduating in STEM fields,"Hispanic students accounted for 16.5 percent of all college enrollments in the United States in 2011, according to a 2012 report by the Pew Hispanic Center.
At the University, they only accounted for 4 percent.
Out of a total population of 33,139 students, there were 1,304 undergraduate and graduate Hispanic students, according to the 2011 University Fact Book.


 


And much of that 4 percent are not majoring in the fields of science, technology, engineering and mathematics.
The University didn’t crack the top 25 in producing a large number of Hispanic graduates in the so-called STEM fields, according to a study by Excelencia in Education.
With the comparatively low percentage of Hispanic University students, not making the list doesn’t seem to surprise Georgina Sanchez, who said she doesn’t often run into Hispanics in her science classes.
“There’s definitely not many Hispanics, even going to the University,” the Hispanic junior biology major from Stockbridge said. “In any of my classes, really, there’s not a big number of Hispanic people.”
Vanessa Gutierrez, a Hispanic junior biology major from Augusta, said most Hispanics she knows are in nutrition fields or social sciences, not science or technology.
“The Hispanics that I know that graduated from high school didn’t go to college because they have to work a lot of the time,"" she said. ""They just don’t have the resources or the help to know how to go about the process.”
Allison Turner, a Spanish and public relations major from Acworth, also said she barely runs into any Hispanic students at the University.
“I typically don’t encounter a lot of Hispanics or Spanish speakers that are my age because there really aren’t many at the University of Georgia in my classes in particular,” she said.


 


In fact, Turner said she encounters more Hispanics outside of the University at her job in food service.
Although the study’s results don’t surprise many students, Deborah Santiago, co-founder and vice president for policy and research at Excelencia, said that intentionally reaching out to Latinos is important.
Many universities that did make the top 25, she said, had programs that provided academic support services to Latino students, though not exclusively to that group, to keep participants in their majors through graduation.
Making sure Latinos graduate — in any field, but especially a STEM field — is important, she said, because in the future, Latinos will play a huge role in the workforce.
“We know through data that Latinos are underrepresented in STEM professions,” she said. “Population projections show that Latinos are the youngest and fastest-growing population. Proportionally, they’re going to be a larger number in the workforce.”",MARIA TORRES,news,https://www.redandblack.com/news/academics/uga-misses-the-cut-for-top-in-hispanics-graduating-in/article_b200f496-ecc9-11e1-b4f5-0019bb30f31a.html
24-Aug-12,Government waste is pressing election year problem,"This fall’s election season is an important — and yes, often annoying — reminder of the issues we face as citizens of our republic. The size and efficiency of the federal government looms large among these issues.
Americans often hear about examples of government waste, cronyism and favoritism in the news, much to the dismay of the taxpayers. Anecdotal evidence is not hard to find: Solyndra, Ener1 and the infamous Government Services Administration (GSA) weekend in Las Vegas are only the frustrating tip of an iceberg of waste.
As a summer intern in the federal government — a military lab, to be specific — I can attest that waste is something that accumulates slowly and surely. 


 


The outrageous GSA Vegas scandal makes for great television, but it only represents a tiny fraction of the problem.
In my firsthand experience, I saw government waste and inefficiency on a daily basis — not to mention stories I heard that were worse.
Every day as I woke up for my internship I was dreeted by a direct view of waste out my Washington, D.C. dorm window, which faced the GSA headquarters on 19th Street. I would see all the lights on in the morning, but nobody in the rooms. Lights were left on at night, too. Not security lights — normal indoor office lights.
Even late Saturday night (as in, after midnight), at least a third of the windows were lit up. Why are we paying to leave those lights on?
Burning bulbs is, unfortunately, just the beginning.
The first week at my research lab, I didn’t have a real room in which to work, because my allotted room was four weeks into a one-week reflooring project. As you can imagine, my productivity the first week was rather limited.
Whenever we needed supplies, we couldn’t just order them ourselves with budgeted money, either. Instead, we had to go through separate ordering people, who were sometimes bound by multi-year exclusive contracts with well-connected defense contractors. Thus, even if we found a superior product at a lower price, we weren’t allowed to buy it.
Worst of all, though, was the culture of spending I witnessed, which is so deeply ingrained in the social and cultural fabric of the federal bureaucracy.


 


Towards the end of the federal government’s fiscal year (Sept. 30), each department or division inevitably has budget money left unspent. This I applaud.
However, in order to ensure that their budget is not cut the following fiscal year, countless departments spend any remaining money, often on frivolous and unnecessary items.
I have heard stories of people flipping through supply catalogs and buying random things, just to spend the balance of a department’s account.
The problem is that this cultural phenomenon is sewn into the very fabric of government, not at the Cabinet level or even the Congressional level, but far below the radar of even the most informed taxpayer.
As a result of my internship experience, I’ve become more cynical of the notion that Congress can cut spending for federal agencies and employees. It’s too big, too bloated, too opaque and too slow. 
This isn’t something that I can honestly fault to either party. It’s much deeper than that.
The only way Congress can meaningfully cut spending is to cut the spending on us citizens.
And if this election doesn’t hinge on that notion, it’s meaningless.

26-Aug-12,Fall fashion features new spins on old styles,"With fall right around the corner, some new and some not-so-new trends are being picked up by fashionistas everywhere. 
For those shoppers who are overwhelmed by the revolving door of women’s fashion trends, I offer this column to break down popular trends for the fall, ripped straight from the runway.
Trend No. 1: Printed Pants 


 


Patterns which were once strictly reserved for tops and scarves have now migrated down south. 
Any kind of print imaginable — from zig-zags to stars — can now be found on pants. 
I absolutely love this trend when worn on skinny jeans or leggings. However, when worn as loose pants they tend to look like pajamas, so I suggest wearing them fitted and keeping the top simple, with minimal accessorizing. 
Trend No. 2: Neo-Baroque
This trend takes the ornate embroidery and jewelry of the 17th century and adds to it a modern twist. 
A neo-baroque dress is perfect to add a touch of regality to a night out, or it can be worn with a leather jacket to dress it down. 
This trend is so classic that it’s sure to come in and out of style throughout the years.  
Trend No. 3: Color Blocking 


 


To all of the doubters, yes, color blocking is still in. 
However, this year’s trend takes on a sportier look. The color-blocking look for 2012 is more “mod” than the dressier, sophisticated style of 2011. It is also found on just about every type of clothing, from shoes and handbags to tops and pants. I am definitely a fan of this new approach to a not-so-new trend. 
The 2012 version has a more laid-back feel that is perfect for daytime. 
Trend No. 4: Sweaters 
Sweaters will always be a staple for fall and winter, but the updated version of these cozy pullovers is wilder. Forget about those boring, solid color wool sweaters that you used to wear as a kid and grab a 2012 sweater that features bold animal prints. They come in an array of colors and animals which give you the ability to pick a sweater with your favorite animal on it, guaranteeing the staying power of this trend. 
I love seeing one of my favorite pieces of clothing in a brighter, updated version. This is a very refreshing and casual trend. 
Trend No. 5: Collars 
They look just like intricately designed necklaces, but they are in fact collars. If you ever want to dress up an outfit or add a collar to a sweater without having to wear multiple tops, then this trend is for you. 


TNCMS.AdManager.render({region: 'fixed-big-ad-bottom-asset', slot: 1, fold: ""below""});


With so many different patterns, colors and fabrics the choices and styling options are endless. This trend is not only innovative but also extremely fashionable, and I am totally on board. 
Trend No. 6: Blazers 
This timeless classic will always be ‘in’ for the college crowd, and will never go out of style. 
Now blazers come in an array of colors, from neon pink and green to Chianti. Rather than the structured menswear blazers we are accustomed to, this year we will wear tailored, schoolboy-styled collegiate blazers. 
This trend is perfect for college students or people who want the dressiness of a blazer without the seriousness and no nonsense vibe it typically exudes. 
As a college student myself, I will definitely be buying a few, in a variety of colors. 
Overall, there are some great things going on in fashion for this year’s fall season. 
These trends can be easily incorporated into any woman’s wardrobe, but the key to rocking these trends is to not go overboard by mixing too many trends at once. Instead, make them fit your own style and flair.

3-Sep-12,Underage intoxicated vehicle break-in suspect found with cocaine,"Athens-Clarke County Police arrested a man on charges of underage possession or consumption of alcohol, possession of schedule III, IV, V substances, entering auto theft and possession of cocaine Saturday at 10:50 p.m., according to an ACC Police report.
The responding officer made contact with Griffin Thomas Robertson, 19, while responding to a report of entering auto, according to the report.
Witnesses reportedly told a different officer that they had seen the suspect “grabbing” the “door handle to multiple vehicles” before they saw him “open the front passenger door to a black Range Rover” and go inside.


 


The witnesses then saw the suspect grab something from inside the Range Rover and “put those items in his front pockets,” according to the report.
ACC Police Department Central Communications reportedly notified the officer of where Robertson was walking and the officer made contact with him on North Lumpkin Street at Hancock Avenue.
The officer reportedly “immediately noticed that [Robertson] was intoxicated” and realized that his ID proved he was underage.
After the officer arrested Robertson for underage consumption, he searched the suspect and found “a large amount of various coins,” a white metal ring and two Alprazolam 2 mg. tablets “in his front right pocket,” according to the report.
These items were reportedly consistent with the items reported stolen from the front of the Range Rover by the owner of the vehicle.
The officer also reportedly found “a small clear plastic wrapper that contained a white powdery substance” that later tested positive “for the presence of cocaine.”
Robertson was transported to the Clarke County Jail.
The Red & Black was unable to reach him for comment.

4-Sep-12,UGA student discovers car stolen after night downtown,"A University student discovered his car stolen after returning from a night downtown Sunday at 10 a.m., according to an Athens-Clarke County Police report.
The student had reportedly parked his car at his friends’ house on East Broad Street Saturday at 4 p.m. and went downtown for the evening. He spent the night at a different friend’s residence.
When the victim returned to pick up his car Sunday morning, his vehicle was gone, according to the report.


 


The victim reportedly called a phone number for Larry and Judy’s Towing, the towing service listed for that location.
The company told him it did not have his vehicle, according to the report.
The responding officer reportedly “had Central [Communications] check ACCPD history"" and University Police history “to see if either agency might have had the vehicle towed.”
Neither agency had any history of the vehicle, according to the report.

4-Sep-12,"Football practice report, Sept. 4: Malcome held out, tight end earns applause","The Georgia Bulldogs met on the Woodruff Practice Fields Tuesday. Here are notes from the sessions made available to the media.

Defensive backs began by practicing making tackles in open space. There were two lines facing each other. One side had the ball and would attempt to juke the player in the other line, as that player would attempt to square the mock offensive player in open space. Devin Bowman was questioned on several occasions by coaches because of his footwork.
Malcolm Mitchell did not participate in this drill, as he was wearing a green jersey, and was limited in practice.
Linebackers practiced shedding blockers and getting to a predetermined hole to stop the run. Alec Ogletree's size and speed impressed as always, though his availability this Saturday is still unknown.
On the offensive side of the ball, quarterbacks and tight ends practiced running hitch patterns out of the shotgun. The first pass completed by Aaron Murray to Arthur Lynch got claps from offensive coordinator Mike Bobo, as did Hutson Mason's first pass.
Running backs began with pass protection drills out of the shotgun. Ken Malcome did not participate in practice.

5-Sep-12,'BASIC FAIRNESS': Program proposed giving health benefits to employees’ domestic partners,"The University may be one step closer to reaching employee benefits equality with a proposal that would implement a full domestic partner benefits package.
The benefits package, which seeks to match the benefits and premiums given to employees’ spouses, is proposed to include health insurance and voluntary benefits, which consist of dental, supplemental life insurance, accidental death and dismemberment insurance and vision benefits.
The benefits program would be effective no later than Jan. 1, 2014, according to the proposal.


 


The University Council’s Human Resources Committee unanimously decided in favor of the proposal, which will be presented to the University Executive Council on Sept. 13.
Fighting for equality
Janet Frick, chair of the Human Resources committee, said the proposal calls for equity for employee benefits, showing “basic fairness” for every University employee.
“You can’t overstate the negative impact of living as a second-class citizen and having your family not receive the same recognition on a societal level [as another employee’s family],” she said. “The proposal makes clear that we are behind the times on this issue.”
Ricky Roberts, chair of GLOBES, said it’s imperative the University grant equal compensation for equal work, regardless of sexual orientation.
“If you are eligible for benefits, you should get them,” she said. “That should not be dependent of what kind of family you have.”
GLOBES — a University organization that advocates for the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer communities — first presented the proposal to the Human Resources Committee on Aug. 28, but Frick said the proposal has been in the works since the end of summer.
The full benefits package for employee spouses includes health insurance and life insurance, according to the University Human Resources website.


 


Frick said these benefits come as a large financial relief for her family — a relief that domestic partners don’t receive.
“It’s a huge financial penalty to these families,” she said. “I have a colleague whose partner is not in a job where she has health insurance, and it costs them hundreds of extra dollars a month to buy private insurance when my husband is on my health insurance, and we get this big financial subsidy from the state.”
Still, Frick said the committee was told state funds couldn’t be used to finance the program because the state doesn’t legally recognize same-sex marriage.
“Because the state doesn’t legally recognize [same-sex marriage], the Board of Regents couldn’t add domestic partners as a class of spouse on policies,” she said.
Frick said the Board of Regents decides the University System of Georgia’s health insurance and defines who is eligible as a legal spouse or child.
“Part of what’s different at Georgia compared to other institutions is that we don’t directly negotiate for health insurance,” she said. “The Board of Regents is in charge of USG health insurance.”
In the proposal, the committee states the use of University discretionary funds or other revenue sources, instead of state funds, to finance the benefits package for domestic partners.
“Some people might claim that we can’t afford it because budgets are tight and health insurance costs are rising,” Frick said. “But I say we can’t afford not to — we can’t afford to continue to discriminate against certain families of employees.”


TNCMS.AdManager.render({region: 'fixed-big-ad-bottom-asset', slot: 1, fold: ""below""});


Competing with peers
According to the proposal, 75 percent of the University’s aspirational peer and peer institutions offer the same employee benefits to domestic partners as granted to spouses.
In addition, USG institutions — Georgia State University, Georgia Institute of Technology, Kennesaw State University, Georgia Perimeter College and Georgia Health Sciences University — all offer voluntary health benefits to domestic partners of benefits-eligible employees, according to the proposal.
Roberts said in order for the University to remain competitive for faculty and staff members, it must offer some type of health benefit package for domestic partners of benefits-eligible employees.
“If you’re a brilliant faculty member and you happen to have a domestic partner, you’re going to make sure you go to a school that has full domestic partner benefits so you can take care of your family,” she said.
Frick agreed, saying she knows job candidates for head level positions who have not come to universities because they refuse to come to a school that doesn’t give benefits to domestic partners of employees.
“It makes us look backwards,” she said. “It makes us look discriminatory even if it’s not what the perspective of all of us is.”
Frick said the University needs to show a stance that states it values all employees, regardless of sexual orientation or gender identity, and without that stance, she said the University won’t recruit the top job candidates.

“It’s a matter of recruitment,” she said. “Many other schools are offering domestic partner benefits, and if the University wants to compete for top faculty and staff members, they need to get on par with other universities.”
 
A brief history of previous efforts to achieve benefits equality at the University
Sept. 2002 — University Council approves resolution to request Board of Regents address issue of benefits for domestic partner, but no action taken by Board.
April 2005 — University Council approves Domestic Partnership Soft Benefits package. Employees must fill out formal application and fulfill the definition of what constitutes domestic partnership.
Oct. 2007 — University Council approves proposal that reaffirms commitment to domestic partner benefits and requests the Board of Regents to include an employee-funded tier for domestic partners. No actions was taken by the Board.

6-Sep-12,"Football Notebook: Backup kicker Lindley impressing, Offensive line injuries still a concern","Mark Richt gave a vote of confidence to backup kickoff man Jamie Lindley on Wednesday.


“Extra point field goal right now, I would say [Marshall Morgan is] pretty solid there, and he kicked off well, but Jamey Lindley, he had the last kick, and he drove it right out of the end zone,” Georgia head coach Mark Richt said. “So he impressed us and I wouldn’t count Jamie out for having an opportunity to kick somewhere along the way.” 
Morgan was impressive on his kickoffs, but coach Mark Richt made sure that Lindley got some credit too.
“I was mentioning Lindley all along,” Richt said, “but we did give Marshall the first shot at it, and he kicked off well. It was a closer competition for the kickoff than it was for the extra point field goal. Lindley is a very good kickoff guy for us.
Morgan, a true freshman, remains humble about the competition.
“I mean, of course, every day is a competition, and he’s an amazing kicker, so it just pushes both of us,” Morgan said. 
Injuries a talking point going into Missouri
The status of offensive linemen John Theus and Watts Danzler still remain in question heading into the weekend.
“[Theus and Danzler] did okay. They didn’t go very long but they practiced. We didn’t want Theus getting anything more than scout team work anyway,” Richt said.
Theus appeared to be healthier than Danzler, but both were limited in Wednesday's practice.
Richt is still hopeful that both men can travel with the team to Missouri. 
“We hope so. If we don’t think they can play or help, we won’t, there’s no chance. If we left today I’m not sure if we’d have both of them, “Richt said.
The status of defensive back Malcolm Mitchell is a little more promising. 
Richt seems confident that Mitchell will be with the team this weekend.
“Coach Grantham might be mad, but yeah, we’re taking him,” Richt said. “[Coach Grantham] might be mad that I’m saying it, not that he’s coming.”
Mitchell was healthy enough to participate in some light contact on Wednesday, though not at full speed.
“I’m not certain that he’s full speed, but its Wednesday. I’m encouraged,” Richt said.
One injury that did not appear on the injury report was the hand injury to tailback Ken Malcome.
There does not appear to be too much concern about the injury. Malcome did need to ice the hand after practice.
“He’s mostly holding in his other hand…there’s usually a dominant side, but he’s had enough reps where even if he held it in one side I’d feel comfortable with him playing,” Richt said.

11-Sep-12,"Website predicts political outcomes better than traditional polls, UGA professor said","Betting on sports isn't new to the Internet, but betting on elections and aliens might be.
The site Intrade.com allows users to bet money on the chance that any given event is going to happen. For example, President Barack Obama is 58.1 percent likely to win the election, according to the site.
“One of the things that makes Intrade particularly fun is that, in addition to political and business events, contracts are traded on all sorts of phenomena, including weather outcomes, scientific progress, and entertainment,” said Terry College professor of banking and finance Bradley Paye. “There is currently a contract trading on the event 'NASA to announce discovery of extraterrestrial life before midnight Dec. 31, 2012.'”


 


Political science professor Keith Dougherty said Intrade can give a more accurate prediction than traditional polls due to polling irregularities in the weeks leading up to an election.
“They tend to predict the outcome of elections better than survey research,” Dougherty said. “It's interesting because the market ones will have closer to the true margins than the surveys.”
Although the site allows users to bet on any given event, it may raise ethical questions about betting on important and pure chance events, said Jonny Street, a biology major from Snellville.
“Betting on a sports game is one thing, but betting on a presidential election is different,” Street said. “It's just to bet on the chances that Obama will be reelected or that scientists will discover the Higgs Boson.""
Paye said Intrade can be useful to anyone that has an interest in events happening and provides a “nice illustration of how market prices reflect participants’ future expectations. ”
But Paye said Intrade's biggest weakness is its lack of trading volume.
“Many of Intrade’s contracts trade infrequently, if at all. When contracts don’t trade frequently, prices may not accurately reflect beliefs about the events in question. Any trader on Intrade must also be wary of trading against more informed parties — 'insiders' in finance jargon.”
Since the site allows betting on a variety of events, users could win big money on an unlikely event. But like any gambling, there are risks to using the site.


 


“Intrade.com is an entertaining and educationally useful site that illustrates how the prices of financial contracts embed market beliefs,” Paye said. “But I wouldn’t advise UGA students to trade significant amounts of money on these contracts, unless of course they do have E.T. housed in their closet.”",Kelly Whitmire,news,https://www.redandblack.com/news/website-predicts-political-outcomes-better-than-traditional-polls-uga-professor/article_cc3cce7a-fbab-11e1-81bb-001a4bcf6878.html
21-Sep-12,"New breed of social media unplugs users, fights online anomie","My social media has boxed me in, and I can’t get out. Even if I could live without it, I certainly couldn’t function without it. And though I have hundreds of digital friends it occurs to me that, for all my online “socializing,” I’m just trapped in front of a plastic screen of light and sound.
Problem? Maybe not, but it would be nice to take my fingers off the keyboard to get some fresh air now and again. Now if I could just find the exit — or the power button.  
Social media is great, but flaws in the traditional “people you already know” platform have lead some entrepreneurs to retool the digital medium for a different objective. But what’s the problem with existing social media to begin with?


 


The first flaw is that people feel an inability to connect — to understand, empathize and sympathize — with people in a digital medium.
Fresh posts may populate your news feed, but there is something sterile about this form of interaction. There is no head nodding, eye contact or body language. We are expected to give the appropriate emotional response to what is essentially a digital news alert. 
Experts in psychology and media research refer to the second flaw as “the fear of missing out.” This depressive response is the feeling that we are being excluded from social interactions — that we are somehow static in a world that exists in flux.
This symptom is prevalent among college students, especially those with a heavy appetite for social media. And who doesn’t?
But in a world so tangled in the digital web, how does one go from interface to physical interaction? What is the alternative?
An up-and-coming web service may hold the answer. At the Pool is a site geared to aggregate people so they can interact.
At the Pool uses an algorithm to match members with “pools” of people with similar interests, ages and locations, among other factors. Members of a certain pool can then assemble meetings, activities or gatherings around their common interests outside the site.
The goal is to create offline communities that meet and function in the real world. Websites with the traditional platform, such as Facebook, do not offer this feature.


 


A Los Angeles tech start-up, Hyphos Inc., launched the site — which is already booming on university campuses — in July. University students at UGA registered nearly 1,000 accounts by the close of August, according to The Red & Black.
The site has accomplished something special in social media. It functions as a tool people can use to maintain steady virtual contact without depriving them of physical interaction.
The concept is gaining momentum among businesses, as dating sites — once exclusively online — are now holding gatherings outside and away from users’ computer screens.
The concept implies that people can utilize social media without taping iPhones to their foreheads. This is a brilliant innovation for human interaction.
It’s easy to get lost in the real world, but it’s even easier to get lost in cyber space. 
Only time will tell if At the Pool and other social start-ups have what it takes to meet consumers’ needs. I, for one, am excited to see how big of a splash they will make.

5-Oct-12,Dining halls allow UGA students to plan ‘balanced’ meals,"University students can now plan their meal with University Food Services before ever stepping foot in a dining hall.
The new nutrition feature of Food Services’ newly designed website allows students access to the daily menu for all of the dining halls, as well as build their plate to see the calories and nutritional content of their meals.
“Everyone is interested in nutrition,” Jeanne Fry, executive director of Food Services, said. “We see labeling in everything we buy. We thought we could take it a step further than that and help students with their dining hall choices.”


 


The build-your-plate feature divides the dining halls by stations, providing key nutritional information.
Food Services also has a mobile web app that can be accessed at http://foodservice.uga.edu/ from any smartphone. It allows students to leave feedback, see occupancy of the various dining halls and update their meal plans. Future plans would include incorporating the build-your-plate feature that is found on the website.
Katherine Ingerson, registered dietitian for Food Services, said nutritional information has always been available in the menu guidebook.
“We don’t have the calories in your face because of eating disorders, but [we] do want to encourage healthy eating with something fun and informative,” Ingerson said.
The idea came from information based on other websites, schools and conferences the staff have attended.
“Our goal is expanding knowledge and getting the information out there. We are encouraging students to learn to make choices in moderation and find a balance in meals,” Ingerson said.
The build-your-plate feature launched Sept. 18. The most accessed part of the website has been the nutrition section.
They hope for even more changes in the future, Allison Harper, marketing coordinator of food services, said.


 


“We strive to continue to improve and make things easily accessible for the students,” Harper said.
The dining halls are also planning on implementing education stations to teach students how to use the build-your-plate option.
“There is always a healthy option, no matter what line you are in. We are not using this feature to fuel calorie counting, rather a tool for learning balanced eating habits for students to carry with them throughout their lives,” Ingerson said.",C.

9-Oct-12,Board of Regents to vote Wednesday on O-House and Terry College construction projects,"The University System of Georgia Board of Regents met Tuesday afternoon at the Georgia Center to approve items to be voted on Wednesday morning — including construction projects at Oglethorpe House and the Terry College of Business.
The board recommended the approval of renovations at O-House to be completed during the summers of 2013 and 2014. The renovations will “upgrade mechanical, electrical and plumbing systems, as well as minor Americans with Disability Act (ADA) and fire code upgrades,"" according to the meeting agenda.
Expansion of Terry College also passed recommendation at the meeting. According to the agenda for the meeting, “This project will consist of new multi-story academic facility to serve the programmatic functions of the Terry College of Business support offices.”


 


“In the facilities committee, there was projects for construction, and those were all discussed. The committee approved them, so that approval means they'll go before the full board tomorrow for the board's approval,"" Board of Regents spokesman John Millsaps said. “So, it's not quite done, but usually when the committee approves an item it's agenda, the board is going to follow suit.”
Academic plans for the University included several new professorships and re-designation of chairs at the University. Among the new professorships recommended were positions at Grady College, Terry College and the College of Pharmacy, as well as positions in biochemical sciences and engineering. Also approved was a doctor of philosophy with a major in interdisciplinary biomedical sciences.

9-Oct-12,"Bacteria detect potential for DNA damage, UGA researchers discover","Diseases such as cancer and Parkinson’s may be connected to chemical compounds that developed on Earth even before bacteria.
Iron-sulfur clusters are cofactors — compounds, often enzymes, which help in the transformation of proteins in cells. Iron-sulfur clusters are some of the most common cofactors in the human body, numbering in the trillions.
“Even before life was on this planet, these were most certainly here. What happened is that nature probably co-opted these very early on to be a major cofactor of polypeptides,” said Michael Johnson, a distinguished professor of chemistry and co-director of the Center of Metalloenzyme Studies.


 


Because life developed in a non-oxygen environment, Johnson said, these iron-sulfur cofactors are now less efficient. The most common form of the cofactor is a four-iron cube structure that is very sensitive to oxygen.
Thirty-nine of these clusters are used in the mitochondrial respiratory chain. Mitochondria are “the powerhouse of the cell,” Johnson said. Aerobic respiration is a process that turns oxygen and sugar into water, carbon dioxide and energy.
Sometimes, the wrong number of electrons are transferred, forming superoxide and peroxide which are a main source of oxidative stress in the human body, Johnson said.
Peroxide and superoxide cause the cube-like four-iron cluster to break down into a two-iron form, releasing free ferrous iron into the cell.
Ferrous iron attacks DNA. This damage can be linked to cancer and Parkinson’s and has tentatively been linked to Alzheimer’s, Johnson said.
Johnson and his research team have discovered a mechanism in some bacteria called the FNR protein — the fumarate and nitrate reduction regulator protein.
Bacteria such as E. coli can be aerobic or anaerobic. They use the FNR protein to detect oxygen and alter how they make energy depending on their environment, lessening the damage caused by oxidative stress.
“It’s not surprising because these things have had a major role in the evolution of life on earth because over the first billion years, there was no oxygen on the planet — none at all,” Johnson said. “Nature had to scramble and figure out, over the next billion years, ways to go from that. Basically, they invented all sorts of enzymes that get rid of superoxide and peroxide very quickly.”


 


These enzymes are only a coping method to deal with the oxygen sensitivity. They do not completely eliminate the damage caused by superoxide and peroxide.
But bacteria also have repair enzymes that can rebuild the iron-sulfur cube by using the free ferrous, DNA-attacking iron in the cell.
“This is the first indication we have of a mechanism in which nature can repair clusters that have been damaged by oxygen. What we don’t know yet is what the specific iron donor is for this process,” he said.
The next step, Johnson said, is to identify the ferrous iron donor and figure out what protein binds it back to the sulfides in the cluster.
“Biology is so incredibly complicated. It’s all checks and balances. It could easily be that we work out that if we do find what the iron donor is and we over express it, it’ll mess up several other things as well. It doesn’t mean that this is the cure for anything really, it just means that if we understand how it works, then at least you’ve got a shot then at figuring out what’s the best thing to try,” he said.
Any medical applications are a long way out, said Bo Zhang, a graduate chemistry student who played a major part in the study.
“I think that since we’re doing the fundamental type of research, it’s nice to know that eventually it might have some application in the therapeutical techniques.”",Jeanette Kazmierczak,news,https://www.redandblack.com/news/bacteria-detect-potential-for-dna-damage-uga-researchers-discover/article_4a6f91b4-1183-11e2-87bc-001a4bcf6878.html
11-Oct-12,"Football notebook: Harvey-Clemons named special teams captain, Murray says father had successful surgery","Georgia quarterback Aaron Murray described the 12 hours following the South Carolina loss as the hardest of his life.
Following the loss Murray came back to Athens to find his house vandalized by disgruntled fans, and learned the next morning his father was diagnosed with Thyroid cancer.
Murray’s parents knew for a few days, but chose to tell the junior quarterback on Sunday after the South Carolina game.


 


“They still hadn’t gotten all the facts and everything like that. They knew [he had thyroid cancer], but everything that was going on they didn’t find out until Friday the day before the game,” Murray said. “They wanted to make sure they had everything for sure right before they told us as well. I think they waited for the bye week to make sure there wasn’t too much on my mind heading into a game.”
Murray explained his parents were trying to get in contact with him Sunday morning to tell him the news, but he was in no mood to talk to anyone.
“Sunday morning my parents were calling me I wasn’t picking up the phone, I don’t want to talk to anyone or see anyone,” Murray said. “I was just lying in my bed and finally they came over and I’m still not getting out of bed. They were trying to push me up and get out of bed. They were like Aaron get some food and I was like no just leave me alone. I was being a little baby then finally they came in and sat down and told me.""
Murray said the news put everything in perspective.
“I didn’t even think of football after that or the game,” he said. “There was nothing on my mind about football at all. It really does put everything in perspective about what is important in life, who’s most important in your life, and putting those things first.”
The good news is that Thyroid cancer has a 95 percent survival rate according to cancercenter.com, and Mr. Murray’s surgery went well: the thyroid was removed.
He was able to eat and walking around that night, and was released from the hospital Wednesday.
Now Murray and his family are waiting to make sure the cancer did not spread to other parts of his body.


 


“[The doctors] just have to wait a few weeks to get the scan and make sure it didn’t spread to other parts of the body,” Murray said. “So hopefully it didn’t spread, and hopefully we got it early enough that it was just in the thyroid and it is removed and gone so we’re praying that that is the case.”
Josh Harvey-Clemons named special teams captain
Safety Josh Harvey-Clemons was named the team's special teams captain following his performance against South Carolina, becoming the first true freshman to earn a captain's spot since 2007.
The last true freshman to earn that distinction was Rennie Curran in 2007, on the defensive side of the ball.
Georgia head coach Mark Richt said that after every game in the coaches’ meeting they discuss captains on each side of the ball.
There had been no special teams captain up to this point.
Harvey-Clemons plays special teams for three units, and following Saturday’s game all three coaches noticed his play.
“Josh is on three special teams and every single coach that coaches the team that he is on all mentioned him doing a good job,” Richt said. “And then I think the first coach that finally said Josh’s name said he is a freshman so he probably wouldn’t be a captain. Then the other coach said he did a good job for me, and he did a good job for me. I’m like well if he did the best job out of everybody he deserves to be a captain I don’t care if he is a true freshman or not.”


TNCMS.AdManager.render({region: 'fixed-big-ad-bottom-asset', slot: 1, fold: ""below""});


Richt explained that a true freshman receives an honor like that.
“When we had our honor role I made a little bigger point of a true freshman winning that captaincy. It is good for him and good for us too,” he said.
Garrison Smith will see the field more.
Richt doesn’t usually like to make it public that a player is going to get more playing time, but he did have one guy in mind: defensive end Garrison Smith.
Over the course of six games Smith has racked up 20 tackles, and Richt believes that Smith will be seeing the field more often.
“Garrison has been playing, but I think we believe he should play more snaps,” Richt said. “One to help other guys get more of a rest and he has been productive when he has been in there. So we feel that he should get more of a rotation than he is getting right now.”",CONNOR SMOLENSKY,sports,https://www.redandblack.com/sports/football-notebook-harvey-clemons-named-special-teams-captain-murray-says/article_0fe6d0c4-138c-11e2-9949-0019bb30f31a.html
12-Oct-12,UGA offers few options for students walking alone at night,"When Jackie Cunningham works at the front desk of Building 1516, she sometimes gets off late at night — and finds herself walking at least part of the way home in the dark.
“I’ve never been chased or anything, but there are times when I’ll look around and I’ll realize that there’s no one around,” she said. “I get really freaked out.”
University Police recommend University students, male or female, do not walk alone at any time at night without first trying to make other travel arrangements.


 


“Individuals seem to provide more of an opportunity for that criminal element,” University Police Chief Jimmy Williamson said.
But Cunningham, a sophomore international business and marketing major from California, does not own a car.
“I pick my hours so that I don’t work late hours because I know I can’t get home. That’s pretty inconvenient, but whatever,” she said. “But I’ll cover shifts for people sometimes at night.”
Cunningham said she usually tries to plan to be picked up from work on those nights, but sometimes that is not an option.
During the home game against Tennessee Sept. 29, Cunningham said she worked until around 10 p.m.
University Campus Transit System buses do not run during home games, and Cunningham said she wanted to make sure her roommate would not have to wait in a line of traffic to pick her up.
So Cunningham took a shuttle to Sanford Stadium before walking to Robinson Court alone.
“It freaked me out,” she said.


 


Williamson said if students feel the need to walk alone at night, they should first tell somebody where they should be.
“If you have no other situation but to walk, then let somebody know what time you’re leaving and what time you arrive,” he said. “Stay on a well-lit path. Don’t try to take shortcuts.”
The University does not have call boxes so people walking on campus can't phone police if necessary. And in August 2011, the police department discontinued its escort van service in the face of budget cuts. The service was designed to give single riders a safe form of transportation around campus at night.
Cunningham said she would be less likely to walk on her own if transportation “were more reliable at night” and if University Police would offer assistance.
“At [Georgia] Tech, if you see cops, they’ll take you home if they’re not doing anything else,” she said. “I was wondering if our cops would do that.”
Williamson said many University Police officers would feel uncomfortable giving students rides home but would ride down the street with them if crime was slow that night.
“We try to help out wherever we can. A lot of times, we just try to be in the general area when they’re walking and it makes [walkers] feel more comfortable,” he said. “They’ll tell us they’ll be walking by an area and if they see us drive by a couple of times, that’s enough.”
Williamson said students are “always welcome"" to call the police with these requests but suggested students find an alternative mode of transportation home at night.

12-Oct-12,"Georgia football season not over, but expectations might need to be lessened","Contrary to some rumors floating about, Georgia's season isn't over after it lost to South Carolina last week.
No, the Bulldogs still have half a season to play, with six games in the books and six more to go. Of course, the talk of Georgia's season being ""over"" wasn't referring to their schedule. ""Over"" meant playing in Miami for this year's national championship was yet another dream deferred, another lost season in the quest to bring a national title to Athens for the first time since 1980. To regroup and keep a flicker of hope alive for that elusive national title, the Bulldogs need more than wins.
They need help.


 


For the second consecutive season, Georgia must receive assistance from other teams to clinch a spot for itself in the Southeastern Conference Championship game. For the second consecutive season, it's the same team the Bulldogs have to root against: the Gamecocks. And for the second consecutive season (sensing a pattern here?), it means Georgia will have to pull for its hated arch-rival when it takes on South Carolina: Florida.
Along with Florida defeating South Carolina, the Bulldogs need the Gamecocks to lose at least one more SEC game, with LSU — South Carolina's opponent Saturday night in Baton Rouge, La. — appearing to be the only team aside from Florida to have a realistic shot of accomplishing the feat.
Then again, if the Bulldogs can't beat the Gators Oct. 27 in Jacksonville, Fla., it doesn't matter what the Gamecocks do the rest of the season. Georgia won't play for the SEC title. And the questions about this team's merit will inevitably follow.
Who cares if the Bulldogs put together another 10-2 regular season if the two losses come against the only two ranked foes they face?
The bigger, more pertinent question is this: how does Georgia make the preceding query a moot point?
First and foremost, the defense has to start playing up to expectations. We heard Jarvis Jones, Bacarri Rambo and Co. passed on the NFL earlier this year to help take the Bulldogs' defense to the next level, a unit that ranked fifth in Division I last season in total defense. Jones is still doing his part, leading the team in sacks (five) despite sitting out against Florida Atlantic. Aside from the continued sterling play of its All-American linebacker, little else has gone right for Georgia's defense. Look at the slow starts in the first halves of the first three games of the season as Exhibit A. Then consider its near-shutout performance against Vanderbilt as an anomaly, when Georgia allowed only three points.
It wasn't a sign of things to come, as the Bulldogs gave up 44 and 35 points, respectively, in their last two games, a stretch which saw them go 1-1.
The defense isn't responsible for all 79 points in those two contests, though. Remember Bryon Moore's pick-six interception in the Tennessee game? Recall Ace Sanders juking and outrunning would-be Georgia tacklers on a punt return last week in the South Carolina game? Those scores can't be pinned on the defense.


 


The responsibility for the latter touchdown lies decidedly on Georgia's special teams unit, which hasn't been special in two years, maybe even three. While one would think Georgia's defense will make improvements over the second half of the season as Rambo and Alec Ogletree rediscover their chemistry, it is hard to have the same confidence about the special teams.
Things like kick return and punt return coverage issues aren't solved overnight. And we haven't even touched on what Georgia head coach Mark Richt earlier this season termed the ""comedy of errors"" on the extra-point unit and the miscues made by Malcolm Mitchell fielding punts.
One unit that shouldn't be worried is Georgia's offense. Despite the lackluster output last week, it will be fine. It's not every day you run into a defensive line like South Carolina has. As Richt and the Bulldogs' offensive linemen attested, Jadeveon Clowney and his teammates were just too much to handle.
Needless to say, that's the last time the Bulldogs will face a defensive line of that caliber this year — in the regular season, at least. So expect Georgia to get back to its high-scoring ways when it takes on Kentucky next week, a squad which has only one win this season and gives up over 30 points per game.
The real test, as per always, comes the following week against Florida. Beat the Gators, and the Bulldogs' (long shot) aspirations of conference and national crowns still lives.
Lose, and well, they should be able to salvage 10 wins, for whatever that's worth given their cream puff schedule.
Another defeat to the Gators and double-digit victories likely still sends the Bulldogs to their dream destination — the Sunshine State — for their bowl assignment.
Just make sure to book hotel reservations in Orlando or Tampa, not Miami.

22-Oct-12,UGA President Adams receives leadership award,"University President Michael Adams received the 2013 Chief Executive Leadership Award from the Council for Advancement and Support of Education District III.
“The key criteria was can the person recognize and create a vision while also inspiring others,” he said. “Establish a positive institution while leading it [to] a higher level of success and increase a stature in a community.”
Singleton said the committee selected Adams due to his consistent demonstration of leadership over the years. Adams became president in 1997, and his retirement is effective June 2013. 


 


“He’s a guy that makes you feel comfortable and makes you want to work with him,” he said. “He thinks of ideas, introduces ideas and supports innovative ideas in a way where [faculty and staff] want to work harder.”
Provost Jere Morehead said he is pleased Adams is being recognized with the award.
“His record of accomplishments as a college president makes him worthy of receiving this recognition,” he said. 
Singleton said the nomination process included 10 to 15 applicants, each of who has the support of at least four other people. He said many worthy applicants applied, but Adams stood out as accomplishing more than one or two initiatives.
“In 15 years, some college presidents can list one or two of these things,” he said. “President Adams increased enrollment and quality of the student, expanded academic majors and offerings, raised fundraising and the University’s image, and the University was recognized as one of the top 20 research institutions.”
The Red & Black was unable to speak with Adams, but in a press release by CASE, he said he was humbled by the recognition from CASE III.

“If a reader tells you they can read everyone, I would run,"" he said. ""You can’t read everyone. Not everyone is meant to be read.""
Badia owns Body, Mind & Spirit, a holistic and metaphysical shop located on Atlanta Highway. Behind the shop, there is a dimly lit room where he does psychic readings for customers.


 


In childhood, Badia discovered that he was unusually sensitive to what he calls the divine. He warned friends and neighbors of misfortunes before they occurred, and in adolescence, he began encountering apparitions.
“In my later teenage years, I started getting, for lack of better words, visitors at night,"" Badia said. ""I would sit up in my bed talking to spirits or talking to entities and then realizing, ‘Wait a minute. You’re supposed to be asleep, and this is your bedroom.’""
Angelina Marks, owner of Psychic Reader on the Atlanta Highway, also experienced strange occurrences at a young age.
“I was in school, and long story short, there was my friend, right in front of me, and all of a sudden, I felt like I had a dream,"" she said. ""I saw her get hit by a car. And I was like, ‘Oh, my God.’ But then she was fine. And then we were out playing the next day, and she got hit by a car. The ball went out in the middle of the road, and she got hit by a car.”
But sporadic visions do not a psychic make. When the clairvoyant children began to notice their talents, they looked for guidance — sometimes from mentors, sometimes from family.
When Badia realized the strength of his abilities, he sought out a psychic development teacher in his native New York. Marks, on the other hand, learned the arts of palm-reading and tarot cards from her mother, another psychic. She has passed her gifts on to two of her three daughters. Betty Payne, who reads tarot cards and palms in her home on Hull Street, also inherited her psychic abilities.
“My great-grandmother was from Ireland,” she said. “When I went over there to visit, she was into her 80s or 90s, and she looked at me and said, ‘Oh, you have the gift, you have the gift.’ She recognized it right away.”
Payne didn’t begin refining her abilities until a beauty shop psychic gifted her with a scarf-wrapped deck of tarot cards. Recovering from a traumatic truck accident gave her ample time to devote to the cards. Becoming psychic, she says, simply means honing one’s natural sensitivities.


 


“I think that, you know, everybody’s intuitive, but some people have it stronger than others,” Payne said. “I think it’s just intuitiveness. You pick up on people, and it’s a gift. The more you practice and use it, it really develops into something that you’re almost not aware of.”
Badia agrees, teaching interested students the ways of the psychic. He draws from his experience in many areas of psychic readings, including tarot cards, numerology, photo readings and kinesiology.
Your friendly neighborhood psychics
The Athens psychics have close relationships with their clients.
Payne prefers for those seeking her services to call ahead of time, but Marks and Badia welcome both walk-ins and appointments. Although the psychics’ clientele sometimes includes students, it consists mainly of long-time Athens area residents. Most advertising for the businesses is word-of-mouth, and the psychics receive visits from regular customers.
“It’s more, in a sense, like a life coach,” Payne said. “It’s really just learning, guiding too.”
Marks also acts as something of a life coach for her clients, who seek her out for guidance before making important decisions. Badia is even a trained counselor, with a bachelor’s degree in addiction, recovery and holistic counseling from Empire State College in New York.
Some curiosity seekers, however, have misconceptions about psychic readings.


TNCMS.AdManager.render({region: 'fixed-big-ad-bottom-asset', slot: 1, fold: ""below""});


“A lot of people aren’t open,” Payne said. “They’re scared of it, but it’s nothing to be afraid of. I feel like it’s from a gift. I don’t feel like it’s anything evil.”
Although misconceptions can be frustrating, some stereotypes are actually good for business. Marks reads palms at Halloween parties, though you will not find her business decked in seasonal spookiness, and client calls increase around New Year’s, when people are especially mindful of the future.
Friend or fraud?
For Badia, there is a distinction between fortune tellers and psychics.
“I hate the word fortune teller,” he said. “I just picture Madame Mazel with her big crystal ball and the beads hanging. When I hear fortune teller, I picture one of those people who is cheating people out of their money.”
Payne is also wary of those who call themselves fortune tellers.
“If she reads palms, I believe her, but a psychic, like I said ... it’s just that they know, that they are clairvoyant, picking up on it,” she said. “Actually, I’ve been to a fortune teller, and she read my palm, and it was good. So you know, some are good, some are bad.”
Phone psychics are also reason for caution. Payne worked for a small psychic hotline during a stay in Helen, but she and Badia agree that although it is possible to read someone over the phone, most psychic hotlines are money-making schemes designed to keep clients on the line. The Athens psychics are committed to performing ethical readings with clients’ budgets in mind.

Morals and magic
Payne and Marks both resist the notion that their practices are antithetical to Christian teachings.
“Some people think it’s something bad, but it’s not. I’m Catholic, so you know I believe in God,” Marks said. “[People] think that it’s something dark, but it’s not. A lot of people put it with something negative, but there’s nothing negative about it. There’s good and bad to everything in life. You just have to test it for yourself.”
Marks’ business location, which doubles as her home, has been in her family for 50 years; her mother marketed psychic services there before her. In her reading room, Catholic images and Bible verses surround the glass case that contains her crystals and tarot cards.
Payne also grew up in the church. For her, psychic talent wasn't a spiritual conflict — it was a gift.
“Spirituality is the main thing. If you’re spiritual, if you’re sincere, you’re not full of bull, you know,” she said. “I think organized religion is a whole different ball game. But when you’re religious, you’re spiritual. I grew up in the church, and I believe in God, and I just believe he likes it. I mean, he gave me the talent. So why not use it, if it can help people?”
Although Badia is knowledgeable about many Eastern religions, he prefers not to associate himself with one faith. However, he also views his gifts as a connection to a higher being.
“[Psychic reading] is getting closer to the divine, for me,” he said. “It gives me a closer feeling to the divine energy, whether people call it God or Christ. I don’t get wrapped up in that because I believe it’s beyond a label. But I’ve always had a hunger for the divine.”

None of the three believe that psychic readings are a thing of magic. Marks, in fact, does not believe in magic at all. Payne, on the other hand, believes that white magic is benign, while black magic is malevolent.
“People do the black magic. I don’t like that,” she said. “I went in one store to buy some candles, and I just started backing out. The energy was so bad there, all the voodoo. But there is white magic; I burn candles all the time. I have done money spells with green and white, orange candles. The last time I did one, this lady in Chicago that had never paid me ... sent me a $1,500 check. It’s just positive energy, you know. [If] somebody’s not doing you right, or you feel their bad energy, just focus and send all the bad energy back to them and it gets away from you. But I wouldn’t touch it.”
Badia sells love spells in his shop, but discourages customers from buying them with the intention of forcing someone to fall in love because he believes that controlling another person’s actions is what defines something as black magic.
“I don’t think there is a connection [between magic and being psychic]. Magic is really energy,” he said. “To me, dark magic is anytime you mess with someone else’s will. A great example of the typical black magic is a child getting on their hands and knees and praying, ‘Dear God, please let Daddy and Mommy get back together again.’”
The elephant in the room
The psychics never know what experiences their readings will bring them. Payne discovered her daughter’s pregnancy before it happened, and Badia has had some bizarre encounters.
“I remember, I was doing a phone reading for a girl in Florida. She said, ‘A friend of mine passed over, can you try and contact her?'"" he said. ""I said, ‘Won’t guarantee, but I will try.’ I’m saying stuff, and she’s like, ‘Yeah, yeah, yeah.’ I was in my living room — never forget this — all of a sudden, I look up, and in my mind’s eye I see an elephant in my living room. And I’m sitting there going, ‘What the hell?’ And I’m trying to figure it out. OK, was the girl heavy? Did she have a good memory? Did they meet each other at a zoo? I’m trying, and then I remember something my teacher taught me: Don’t interpret. Just give them what you got. If you try to interpret it, you’re going to be wrong. I said to her, ‘What is significant with the elephant?’ She said, ‘The elephant?' And I didn’t like the tone, and I said, ‘Yeah ... there’s a huge elephant standing in my living room.’ She said, ‘I’m sitting in my living room, staring at a little elephant that she gave me.’”
Events like this are not uncommon for Badia; he once saw a horse that wouldn’t leave until his client revealed that she drove a Mustang.

Not every reading provides insight into the immediate present and future; events in clients’ pasts and futures get muddled somewhere in the clairvoyant ether. Payne once discovered that a young woman had terminated a pregnancy in the past during a reading for her future.
And readings are not always accurate. Payne avoids reading her daughter’s palm because she has difficulty distinguishing between what she feels as a psychic and what she feels as a mother. Sometimes, Badia learns more about a client’s relatives than he learns about the client. All three psychics said that it is impossible for them to read clients at all when they are too guarded — if they are not “open.”
Tricky business
The psychics said that the public generally respects their line of work, though it doesn’t always embrace it.
“You’re gonna get some people who are accepting it, some who are not, you know, just like a lot of different businesses,” Marks said. “That’s part of life. The majority of people are very positive about it.”
Some Athenians, however, are very unnerved by this mysterious profession. Badia claimed that his previous landlord refused to renew his lease because of misperceptions about Badia’s practice.
“He was going around telling people I’m a devil worshipper. And [I’m not]. But I thought to myself, ‘If this is Christianity, I think I’d rather serve a devil.’ I thought you weren’t supposed to bear false witness, didn’t Jesus say that?” Badia said. “But I was just like, ‘Well, I guess I’m not supposed to be here anymore.’ And he did me a favor because this location is actually much better. I don’t pay attention to that. I really don’t focus on, do you support me or are you a skeptic. If you want to come in, do; if you don’t, don’t.”
Payne said that her practices have not been detrimental to her relationships with those outside of psychic circles. She has been a member of the Chamber of Commerce for years due to her involvement in the trucking industry, and she has passed out cards in meetings. As far as friendships go, her abilities don’t have to play a part.

“I have a real good friend, and she doesn’t talk about it. You know, if I mention it, she changes the subject,” she said. “So I don’t say anything. If it offends her, it offends her.”
Truthful, but uncertain
“Psychic” is a word that arouses chills in some and curiosity in many.
But beyond the mystique of this age old occupation are not Madame Mazel’s crystal ball or Professor Trelawney’s frizzy tresses. Instead, there are a Catholic’s crucifixes and a shop owner's eco-friendly lamps.
Set apart by uncanny experiences since childhood, the Athens psychics accept the responsibility that comes with their talents. Unfazed by opposition, they offer guidance to those with questions.
Payne, Marks and Badia bely the sinister reputation of their title and promise to give clients answers, even if the only one is an unfortunate but honest “I don’t know.”",Sarah Anne Perry,variety,https://www.redandblack.com/variety/lifelines-the-life-cycle-of-a-psychic-from-talented-kid/article_7fcc2eb2-1d77-11e2-bc8c-001a4bcf6878.html
25-Oct-12,Republican representative candidate runs after feeling ‘patronized by’ his party,"Republican Carter Kessler decided to run for state house in the 118th District because he was tired of being “patronized by [his] party.” 
“That’s just the resounding feeling I got from these people in power,” he said. “They just did not give a f---.”
This is his first time running for political office.


 


Kessler said he was “genuinely angry” at the party for awhile, but still describes himself as “pissed off.”
Kessler felt the same way at the University. Kessler pursued an economics degree at the University of Georgia from 1999 to 2004 and again in 2009 but never graduated. 
“The first time, I left and started a business with my friend, and I just thought it was something better to do with my time,” he said. 
Kessler said he wanted to go back to finish a degree, but got “fed up with what they were indoctrinating [him] with and I didn’t want to pay any more money to learn things [he] didn’t agree with.” He said he “has a real big problem” with Keynesian economics, a school of thought. 
He said he is “committed to breeding competition in political elections.” 
“That’s what really pissed me off is that these people could get away with anything like passing indefinite detention or letting the TSA do things at the airport that cops aren’t even allowed to do, and it’s all because there’s no one to challenge them in their safe Republican districts because they’ve gerrymandered so well that they’ve marginalized competition to such a science that, you know, this isn’t good for anybody,” he said. 
Kessler has brought his message of fiscal responsibility and liberty to the streets of Athens in his khakis and New Balance sneakers. 
He starts in the afternoons from his overgrown house on Holman Avenue. He sits at his kitchen table, littered with stacks of papers, signing last-minute notes before the team heads out. Gibbs, a black lab with bald spots along his back, wanders around the room. 


 


Kessler gets in the passenger seat of a white Jeep Cherokee with campaign stickers on the sides. Kessler is still on probation from a DUI in 2011. 
He picks a neighborhood based on the information his campaign has obtained from the voter registry. 
He knocks on doors, leaving information if no one is home, and chatting if someone answers the door. 
“Hi, I’m Carter Kessler, running as a Republican for State House District 118,” he started. 
He gives the voter a couple of his main points, including responsibility in fiscal appropriations and a salary cap for government officials. 
He answers questions and leaves a number in case they need further information. 
“I really appreciate Carter’s accessibility,” said Jonathan Sims, a local restaurant manager who attended a campaign event for Kessler Monday. “I’m impressed by his personal drive and the way he wants to get inside and change the system.” 
Lamar Wise, Kessler’s liberty coach, said he came to work on Kessler’s campaign because he believed that “Carter is someone who can do really good things.”

26-Oct-12,Missouri looking to bring stability and success to SEC in first season,"Frank Haith is coaching in a new conference for the second season in a row.
The Missouri head coach took over the Tigers in 2011, leading them to a 30-5 record and a Big 12 championship.
Following a first round loss in the NCAA tournament, Haith and the Tigers found out that they would be heading to the Southeastern Conference come 2012.


 


While Haith is excited about entering a new conference, he knows it will be no easy task.
The Tigers lost eight lettermen and four starters from last year’s team, and come in with only two players that have been coached under Haith.
“It is difficult and... we have a team of only two guys that we have coached last year. Everybody else is new,” Haith said. “That was the great thing about last year’s team. They trusted one another, had great chemistry, and we played as a cohesive unit. This team is not quite there yet, but that’s the plan.”
Despite the lack of experience, Haith has the luxury of having two experienced returning players.
The team returns SEC preseason player of the year Phil Pressey and 2011 Big 12 sixth man of the year, Michael Dixon Jr.
""[Pressey] really led us and I think he has really improved even from last season,” Haith said. “He had a great summer. Those preseason accolades are what they are, preseason. He has got to go out and play and he understand that and he is talented enough to go out and compete and he is excited about the opportunity.”
While Haith is excited about Pressey’s junior campaign, coaches around the league are dreading it.
Georgia head coach Mark Fox thinks that Pressey’s preseason hype is warranted.


 


“Pressey is a terrific player, and any coach in any game is going to look at one of the best players in the league and figure out what are we going to do with this guy,” he said. “I’m not sure there is an answer for him. He is explosive, he is quick, he is a very dynamic player. The guys that are next to him is very similar. They are a very unique team.”
With only Pressey and Dixon Jr. returning from last year’s squad, Missouri was still picked by the media to finish third in its inaugural SEC season.
Part of this ranking can be credited to the four transfer athletes the Tigers received after the 2011 season.
Those include Jabari Brown and Earnest Ross from Auburn, Keion Bell from Pepperdine and Alex Oriakhi from Connecticut.
“All those guys will have an impact,” Haith said.
All four players played major roles for their teams last season, the most notable being Bell, who scored more than 1,300 points in his three years with Pepperdine.
Haith described Oriakhi’s transfer as a “Christmas present,” and says that the senior forward has only improved since coming to Missouri.
Oriakhi and the rest of the transfers will all need to improve to compete in what Haith described as “a more up-tempo league”.


TNCMS.AdManager.render({region: 'fixed-big-ad-bottom-asset', slot: 1, fold: ""below""});


“One thing I have done is this summer I started looking a tape of the SEC and I think the one that that definitely stands out is the amount athleticism in this league,” Haith said. “It is a very athletic league. I also think they play a style in terms of tempo defensively than the Big 12. There is more pressing, there is more aggressive play, extending their defense in this league than there was in the Big 12.”
Yet, even with Haith’s respect for the SEC, he believes it to be an underrated league on a national scale.
He attests this to the juggernaut that is SEC football.
“There is no question [SEC basketball is overrated],” Haith said. “Part of it is because the football team is so darn gone good. I think it is underrated league. But I do think in time this league will get its due just. On a national scope of things people overlook it because the football is just so dominant.”
Many believe that with the addition of Missouri and Texas A&M to the league, the SEC can be seen as a more powerful basketball conference.
Haith hopes to add some excitement to the league and thinks that there could be as many as six or seven teams that reach the NCAA tournament this season from the SEC.
He believes his team can be one of them.
“Well we’re hopeful that we can come in and add some more stability to the league in terms of two more good programs,” he said. “In basketball we have a passionate fan base in Columbia. They love basketball. Hopefully we can bring that to the league and some excitement, and some good basketball.”",CONNOR SMOLENSKY,sports,https://www.redandblack.com/sports/missouri-looking-to-bring-stability-and-success-to-sec-in/article_e6531c44-1fb7-11e2-8703-0019bb30f31a.html

31-Oct-12,Candidates channel their inner ghouls for Halloween,"In a month dominated by creepy crawlers and scary movies, who would have thought that the two presidential candidates would be causing the most fright this October.
With elections just six days after Halloween, the real question on Americans’ minds is not how many changes Mitt Romney can make to his political platform before ballots are cast, but how both presidential candidates will be celebrating this Halloween.
While both Governor Romney and President Barack Obama have been searching for a magic spell to conjur up redeeming budget numbers, neither has managed it (despite plenty of sly wizardry by their mathematicians).


 


This campaign has had its fill of spooks, from the skeletal tax reports in Romney’s closet to the $6 trillion phantom haunting Obama’s nightmares.
Romney’s Halloween plans are sure to include plenty of treats for the 53 percent of Americans not trick-or-treating at the White House this year, while Obama will be knocking down the doors of the rich for all their extra candy corn.
Both candidates were in Halloween spirits during the first debate, Obama practicing a living dead face for his mummy costume and Romney attempting to use laser vision as part of his self-declared superhero get-up. Romney has taken the role of middle class hero to heart lately. His one kryptonite: reality.
Obama will be able to save a buck on his costume this year, as he is already mummified by the huge debt that former President George W. Bush left for him. All he will have to do is wrap himself in the growing number of “I owe you” slips and rejected legislative proposals he has amassed the past four years and voilà! You have Barack O’Mummy.
The undead won’t stop in October for Romney, because, with his replacement health care proposal, everyone with preexisting medical conditions are as good as dead. If you’re over 60, pretend like you didn’t hear that.
Romney has also found some Halloween inspiration in his oil independence plan. Like a vampire, he plans to bite into U.S. oil reserves to suck America dry.
Obama’s energy plan is a little more out of this world — pumping funds into bubbling cauldrons filled with potions of alternative fuel that have resulted in viable green energy sources no more realistic than flying broom sticks.
The season isn’t complete without some blood and guts, and (third debate notwithstanding) that’s just what Romney has in mind for foreign policy. Hit ‘em where it hurts to get what you want, and if all else fails — well, everyone loves a good fireworks show.


 


The tricks just keep trickling down, with each candidate’s own mini-minion working to secure the election in key swing states. Better known as the vice-presidential candidates, these two individuals are in the holiday spirits as well.
Paul Ryan is playing the Robin to Mitt’s Batman in his superhero theme, but keep an eye out for talking tea cups and mad hatter outfits, as Ryan is never too far from a good tea party.
Joe Biden may be hoping to attend this year’s seasonal celebration in the classic Hulk attire, to put some muscle behind the next punch in the Democratic campaign, but Obama advisers have Biden on a tight leash and he will be instructed to keep his shirt on as the campaign winds down.
The prize both tickets seek at the end of the election may be the scariest part of the entire journey, though: taking office in the haunted White House.
Haunted by the ghost of presidential decisions past and countless years of life spent fretting and howling away in the Oval Office, the victor is sure to have his share of horrors ahead of him.
More frightening still, just up the hill from the office loom 535 spiders, entangled in webs of debt and waiting to devour any proposal, act or change these candidates hope to put in place.
So citizens, enjoy this Halloween season. Get chocolate wasted, stay up watching scary movies or — even more terrifying — C-SPAN and just remember that, come Nov. 6, even the dead come out to vote, so don’t forget a valid driver's license.

2-Nov-12,"Saban whines about Ole Miss hurry-up, Georgia prepares","After Ole Miss found success with its no-huddle style offense against Alabama four weeks ago, Alabama head coach Nick Saban proved even undefeated coaches can sound whiney.
Alabama won that game, but allowed the most points they’ve given up all year (14). Saban later complained the game speed put players safety at risk and wasn’t fair for opposing defenses.
If the offense doesn’t make substitutions, the rules don’t allow the defense to make substitutions. If the offense takes a few seconds to change personnel, the referees will stand on the ball until the defense has time to set their lineups.


 


“You go on a 14, 15, 16-play drive and they’re snapping the ball as fast as you can go,” Saban told reporters on Oct. 3. “And you look out there and all your players are walking around and can’t even get lined up. That’s when guys have a much greater chance of getting hurt, when they’re not ready to play. … I just think there’s got to be some sense of fairness in terms of asking is this what we want football to be?”
His grumbles lit a fire under the blogosphere and found few supporters outside Tuscaloosa.
What Saban described was a team that wasn’t ready to handle one Ole Miss’s biggest weapons — game tempo. No, it’s not as traditional as counting on a record-setting quarterback or All-American linebacker. But the hurry up is an offensive tool just like any other.
I was happy to hear Georgia is taking a different approach before they go head-to-head with the face-paced Rebels offense.
“That’s football,” senior linebacker Christian Robinson said. “If you’re getting beat, you need to stop it. That’s not a safety issue. That’s a defensive issue.”
Richt agreed facing the no-huddle can be problematic, but it’s something he plans to overcome with practice — not a rule change.
The Ole Miss style of play will push Georgia players to their limits. They’ll spend more time on the field, have less time to catch their breath, and will have to make adjustments on the fly. But every consecutive play they’re forced to run, the Rebels will be running right across the line. This rule isn’t a question of fairness. Both teams will run the same amount of plays, in the same amount of time and will have the same opportunities for substitutions. The only difference is preparation. The Rebels have proven they’re capable of sustaining high-tempo drives. So now the Bulldogs must ask themselves, are they?
Georgia coaches didn’t seem too worried. They know what Ole Miss is capable of, but they’ve worked on it in practice and will be ready to make game day adjustments.


 


“Our biggest challenge is just going to be to line up and get ready,” Richt said. “They’ve caught a lot of people not being ready and they’ve taken advantage of that.”",JACOB DEMMITT,sports,https://www.redandblack.com/sports/saban-whines-about-ole-miss-hurry-up-georgia-prepares/article_d17fb496-2500-11e2-be5a-001a4bcf6878.html
2-Nov-12,Matchups: Red zone play will be key for Georgia defense,"Georgia (7-1, 5-1 SEC) will face Ole Miss (5-3, 2-2) Saturday in a game that will help determine the Bulldogs' conference hopes. If the No. 6 Bulldogs defeat the Rebels, they will only have to win against Auburn next week to tie up the Southeastern Conference Eastern division. 
Georgia defense vs. Ole Miss offense in the red zone
The Bulldogs held the Gators to only six points on a pair of Aaron Murray interceptions last week that easily could have turned into touchdowns. Things likely won't be so easy this week, as the Rebels' offense poses a more difficult force to keep out of the end zone. Ole Miss has scored on 26 of 28 trips inside the red zone this season, with 20 of those scores accounting for touchdowns. That 92.9 percent conversion rate ranks sixth-best in the nation and second-best in the SEC, trailing only Alabama. The number of forays inside the red zone for the visitors will likely be a deciding factor whether the Bulldogs pick up the win or get upset by the Rebels at home.


 


Aaron Murray vs. Ole Miss secondary
After playing one of his worst games as Georgia's starting quarterback against Florida — which came off the heels of a career-best passing day against Kentucky — Saturday will pose yet another challenge for Aaron Murray. Ole Miss has picked off 10 passes this season, tied for fifth-most in the SEC, with a trio of Rebels with a pair of picks in linebacker Denzel Nkemdiche and defensive backs Cody Prewitt and Dehendret Collins. The good news for Murray: Arkansas' Tyler Wilson threw for 297 yards and two touchdowns against Ole Miss last week. The bad news: Wilson also tossed two interceptions, and the Razorbacks lost 30-27. Murray, take note.
Georgia offensive line vs. Ole Miss plethora of pass rushers
The Bulldogs' big men up front bounced back with a standout showing last week against Florida. After getting dominated by South Carolina and a solid-if-unspectacular performance against Kentucky, Georgia's offensive line gave Murray protection and opened up holes for running back Todd Gurley to get his fifth 100-plus yard game this season versus Florida. This week, the challenge is to keep Murray upright once more. The Rebels have 22 quarterback takedowns this season, fourth-most in the league. What makes Ole Miss so difficult to prepare for the inability to key on one pass-rushing specialist. Five Rebels have two or more sacks — defensive end and Albany native Jason Jones has a team-best 2.5 — while another nine have at least one. If Murray's passing touchdown count is higher than the number of times the Rebels bring him down, it will be a positive sign for the Bulldogs' chances at a win Saturday.",RYAN BLACK,sports,https://www.redandblack.com/sports/matchups-red-zone-play-will-be-key-for-georgia-defense/article_a1487440-253a-11e2-ac6c-0019bb30f31a.html
3-Nov-12,Georgia/Ole Miss: Game Rewind,"After going down 10-0 in the first half, Georgia flipped the switch and beat Southeastern Conference opponent Ole Miss 37-10. The Bulldogs relied on a little trickery and several long balls from quarterback Aaron Murray to bring home the win.
PLAYER OF THE GAME
Aaron Murray


 


With help from the long ball, Georgia quarterback Aaron Murray looked back to form after a rough game against Florida last week. He threw three touchdown passes from outside the 40-yard line, including one 66-yard bomb to wide receiver Marlon Brown off a play action fake. Murray finished the night with 21 completions on 28 attempts for 384 yards and four touchdowns.
OVERLOOKED PLAYER OF THE GAME
Collin Barber
Only a punter can have the best game of their career and go almost completely unnoticed. Barber punted the ball for an average of 50.7 yards, including one 60-yarder. He pinned Ole Miss on their own 3-yard line, setting the defense up for a safety in the third quarter. Before tonight, Barber was averaging 39.4 yards per kick.
KEY MOMENT
Touchdown catch as the clock expired before halftime
Murray found wide receiver Tavarres King in the end zone for a 40-yard touchdown catch with three seconds left in the first half. The score put the Bulldogs up for the first time going into the locker room. It represented a momentum swing from which the Rebels would never recover.
QUOTE OF THE GAME


 


Georgia head coach Mark Richt on 4 turnovers in 5 plays in the middle of the second quarter:
“Oh that was wild, wasn’t it? Yeah that was wild. The thing about our turnovers, it seemed like we got a lot of yards after the turnover. We had an interception, I believe Damian got a good amount of mileage out of. … The main thing is once you get the turnover, don’t turn it back over. Let’s secure the football and make sure we still have the ball when the play is over.”

4-Nov-12,"Auburn will not be competitive next week, despite Richt's 'tough' talk","It’s the season of perfectly crafted political statements as the candidates brace for the final stretch — and I’m not talking about those in Washington D.C.
The Southeastern Conference Championship game is all but decided, as two teams find themselves just one win away from earning a spot in Atlanta. Next weekend, Georgia and Alabama will face off against Auburn and Texas A&M, respectively, with the chance to clinch their spot.
With the goal in sight, Georgia head coach Mark Richt isn’t taking anything for granted. He spoke like a true politician after Saturday’s win over Ole Miss, reminding the team the season isn’t over yet.


 


“We know that Auburn will be very ready to play,” Richt said in the postgame press conference. “We know going there is a tough place to play. We know Auburn fans don’t really like Georgia a whole lot. We know that we’re going to have to be at our best. So I told the guys, get your mind right. Get your jaw right. We have seven more days before we could have an opportunity to finish.”
But Richt is certainly giving the Tigers a little more credit than they deserve. With the Tigers at a laughable 2-7 record (they will likely finish the season with zero conference wins), the Bulldogs very well could be at their worst on Saturday and still stroll away winners.
The Tigers and Bulldogs have faced just two common opponents, in Vanderbilt and Ole Miss. Georgia beat both by more than three touchdowns. Auburn lost to both. The Tigers have averaged 100 fewer passing yards per game and 40 fewer rushing yards. Georgia broke school records by scoring more than 40 points in five straight contests, a feat Auburn has accomplished just once this season, against New Mexico State in the season opener.
Even local fast food restaurants are losing hope. According to AL.com, a Krystal sign in Auburn, Ala., read, “Go Tigers Beat Somebody” before this weekend’s matchup.
So despite what Richt tells the players in the locker room, Georgia will not have to be at their “best” to topple the limping Tigers, even if it is a rivalry game. A mediocre Aaron Murray, above average defense and conservative play calling should do the trick. But don’t tell them that.
Richt did exactly what he needed to do on Saturday. He instilled a little fear and challenged his players not to get complacent. The Bulldogs will prepare just as hard as they’ve worked every other week and will be ready to avoid disaster on Saturday.
But for everyone playing along at home, you may want to go ahead and book a hotel in Atlanta for the weekend of Dec. 1. I hear those rooms will be filling up shortly.

4-Nov-12,"Georgia football recruit nicknamed 'The Finisher,' also has surprisingly good tennis game","Though most only know him as “Brandon,” Georgia recruit Brandon Kublanow earned his nickname “The Finisher” by embodying what every school looks for in an offensive lineman: toughness, ferocity and relentless play.
The consensus four-star offensive lineman, an Alpharetta native attending Walton High School, quickly caught the attention of Georgia scouts because of his brutal physical presence on the field.
“It’s just because I kill kids,” Kublanow said of his nickname. “[Reporter Michael Carvell] from the AJC gave it to me, and it just stuck. I don’t actually go by that. My friends don't call me 'The Finisher.'”


 


Other top-flight football schools noticed Kublanow’s potential as well. Over the course of his junior year, he received scholarship offers from several Division I programs, including Florida, Florida State, South Carolina and Clemson.
But the Georgia native felt at home with the Bulldogs.
“It was just a great fit for me,” he said. “I have a lot of family up there, teammates too, and I love the opportunity I have at the University.”
Like many University students, proximity to home and family played a major role in Kublanow’s commitment decision.
“I know it's a party school, but really the campus is awesome,” he said. “It's only an hour-and-a-half from home, so it's not too close, but not too far away either.”
Part of that comfort also comes from a deeply-rooted affinity for Georgia athletics.
“I think he's been a lifelong Georgia fan,” Walton head coach Rocky Hidalgo said. “I think that's all along where he wanted to go. I know he's going to be a great player there. He'll represent our program well, and I'm excited for him.”
Kublanow confirmed his head coach’s thinking as he discussed the pride he took in being a Bulldog following last Sunday’s victory over then-No.2 Florida.


 


“I kind of grew up as a Georgia fan,” he said. “So I was happy for UGA to win a game like that, and happy to be a part of Dawg nation. It was cool.”
Kublanow feels fortunate to be accepted at Georgia, and the Georgia coaches should feel the same way, Hidalgo said. He said the Bulldogs have a special player on their hands.
“He’s fierce,” Hidalgo said. “In addition to everything [people] know about what a great player he is, he's an incredible young man with good integrity. He's a great leader and an incredibly hard worker.”
The Georgia offensive line has improved in recent games, but it remains inconsistent nonetheless. When asked if Kublanow could make an immediate impact at the collegiate level, Hidalgo expressed confidence in his star center.
“They'll be hard-pressed to keep him out of the lineup, that's for sure,” he said.
But beyond his standout play on the football field, most fans are unaware of Kublanow’s second passion for an entirely different surface: the tennis court.
Kublanow proudly displays his former ranked status as a 12U player on his Twitter account description.
“I've still played [tennis] a lot, but I've had to focus on football, which is what I love,” he said. “I’ll probably be on the varsity team this year and just screw around. I’ll probably end up playing doubles, but I want to play singles.”


TNCMS.AdManager.render({region: 'fixed-big-ad-bottom-asset', slot: 1, fold: ""below""});


The 6-foot-3 lineman’s biggest strength? Playing the net, of course.
“I’m great at hitting volleys,” he said.
Kublanow now turns his attention to finishing his senior season on a high note. The Walton Raiders are 6-2 and hope to capture a state title after losing in last year’s championship game.
Hidalgo believes Kublanow will be an integral part of both Walton’s and Georgia’s successes going forward.
“He's done a great job setting an example for all the players with his work ethic, and on top of that he plays the game incredibly hard,” he said.",ALEC SHIRKEY,sports,https://www.redandblack.com/sports/georgia-football-recruit-nicknamed-the-finisher-also-has-surprisingly-good/article_7ac66240-253b-11e2-bd94-0019bb30f31a.html
4-Nov-12,"Football Notebook: Gurley collects another 100-yard game, offensive line struggles mightily in first half","Todd Gurley makes things look easy.
Georgia's sensational freshman tailback put up his sixth 100-yard performance of the season Saturday, rushing for 117 yards on 18 carries against Ole Miss. It boosted his total for the year to 857 yards, fifth-most in Georgia history for a freshman, and surpassing Isaiah Crowell's total of 850 last season. Time and again, Gurley has expressed surprise at the ease with which he has adapted to the Southeastern Conference.
That hasn't changed.


 


""It's shocking, just to keep doing it this late in the season,"" he said. ""Your body is not like it was at the beginning, and to still do that, it's big. But I couldn't do that without my fullback and my line out there. Those guys are doing the same thing I'm doing. They're still fighting and those guys never get a break.""
One thing Gurley and fellow freshman tailback Keith Marshall uncharacteristically did Saturday was put the ball on the ground, as each fumbled the ball away to the Rebels in a bizarre sequence in the second quarter which saw four turnovers in a five-play span. Georgia head coach Mark Richt said those kind of mistakes were things you would expect from the young pair earlier in the season. He wasn't too displeased, however.
The freshmen duo's play this year has been too good to let one game override the previous eight.
""They both have secured the ball well. They have very good ball security habits,"" he said. ""That doesn't mean it will never come out, but they really do a good job running with the ball high-and-tight, up against the rib cage, and when they get into a crowd, they do a good job wrapping up with two hands.""
First half rough for offensive line
The first 30 minutes of play Saturday could not have gone any worse for Georgia's offensive line.
Ole Miss took down Georgia quarterback Aaron Murray five times, just one week after Florida was unable to tally one sack against the unit. To make matters worse, the Bulldogs lost one of their stalwarts in Chris Burnette — the team's starting right guard — in the second quarter with a left shoulder injury. The line regrouped in the second half, and did not allow another sack in the 37-10 win. But questions about the dismal showing in the first half lingered afterward.
What went wrong to enable the Rebels to find their way to Murray so often?
""We just couldn't block their normal edge rush, our tackles were struggling, especially the left tackle,"" Richt said. ""Some things happened inside, but both of our tackles had some troubles with them. We knew on film they were very good pass-rushers, so what we started to do is run more seven-man protections, which is more a maximum protection, but then we ran some more five-man protections, which free releases everybody.""
With five-man protection, Richt said, the onus is on the quarterback to get the ball out quickly. As the game wore on and the Bulldogs started to pick up on the Rebels' blitzes better, Richt noted the protection improved. The man with the bird's-eye view agreed: Murray said the unit made the proper adjustments to help him stay upright. Besides, Murray felt placing all the blame on the line wouldn't be fair, since the offense as a whole struggled during a scoreless first quarter.
Not that he would be crazy enough to call out his linemen, anyway.
""I might yell at a receiver, a tight end or running back, but you never yell at your offensive line,"" Murray said. ""I know better than that. They came up to me and said, 'Aaron, we've got your back. Don't worry about it.' Once we got a couple of things cleaned up as far as picking blitzes up, we were hitting on all cylinders.""
Bulldogs 'don't know' about severity of injuries to Burnette, Brown
Richt was asked about the status of a pair of injured players in Burnette and wide receiver Marlon Brown. Burnette exited in the second quarter with a left shoulder contusion, while Brown left with an apparent left knee injury, coming at the end of a 30-yard pass play in the third quarter.
Richt could offer no explanation, simply saying he ""didn't know"" the extent of the ailments yet.
But wide receiver Tavarres King provided some insight on Brown's injury, none which sounded good.
""I just went over and prayed for him,"" he said. ""I don't know what's going on there. I'm really anxious to see what's up with him.""
After Burnette departed, junior college transfer Mark Beard was inserted at tackle. Richt has been impressed with the Alabama native, who has seen more and more playing time over the past three games as injuries have started to take a toll on the offensive line. And if Burnette is sidelined for an extended period of time, Richt said Beard better be prepared to be on the field a lot more.
""Beard's a very athletic guy, and he has the ability to play the position,"" Richt said. ""He just needs reps, needs opportunities. And he got a lot of opportunity, and depending on what happens with Chris, he may get a lot more opportunity.""
Quick hitters
Richt lauded the play of true freshman punter Collin Barber, who averaged 48.2 yards per kick on five attempts, including a massive 60-yarder in the first quarter. ""That punt there, we've seen a lot,"" he said. ""We've seen it in practice a lot, we haven't seen it a lot in games, but he's very capable of kicking it high and getting great hang time."" ... Georgia blanked Ole Miss in the second half, the second time this season it allowed no points after halftime. Georgia also shut out Vanderbilt in the final 30 minutes of its 48-3 victory in Athens Sept. 22. ... Linebacker Alec Ogletree's safety in the third quarter was the first two-pointer for the Bulldogs since Brandon Boykin had one in the 2012 Outback Bowl. ... Murray's four touchdown passes Saturday gave him 80 for his career, extending his own school-record and moving him into sixth place in SEC history. He passed former Florida signal-caller Rex Grossman (77) and two former Kentucky quarterbacks in Jared Lorenzen (78) and Andre Woodson (79) to move to the cusp of the top five. Sitting in fifth place, with 81 career touchdown tosses, is Ole Miss alumnus Eli Manning. ... In an interesting twist, sophomore strong safety Corey Moore got his first career start as a Bulldog — it just came on offense as a wide receiver. ""He's a physically tough guy, and when you come in motion, you can seal the defensive end on an outside play, and we're trying to see if he could do a good job blocking it,"" Richt said. ""He likes contact. He enjoys that kind of thing.""",RYAN BLACK,sports,https://www.redandblack.com/sports/football/football-notebook-gurley-collects-another--yard-game-offensive-line/article_f36d778c-26a4-11e2-8a55-001a4bcf6878.html
6-Nov-12,Political intolerance takes off in run-up to election,"As everyone is well aware, the presidential election is upon us.
We’re also pretty aware of the incessant name-calling, passive-aggressive posting and extreme viewpoints from both sides on Twitter and Facebook. It seems like there’s no in-between for most people: there’s only a life-or-death, “most important decision in history” point of view that says this election is the only one that matters and this is the only chance you have to make sure your friends and family and peers know just how valuable and revolutionary your thoughts are.
It’s that perspective that makes election season a trying time. Above all else, it shows just how intolerant people are of others' thoughts. Those with liberal views generalize conservatives as backwards and intolerant; people who fall on the conservative end of the spectrum see those on the liberal end as immoral and lazy.


 


Are those views for everyone on the right and left? Of course not, but election years seem to heighten the extremity of opinions.
Instead of pointing fingers and creating flame wars about one political party or another, it would be much more helpful to hold your point of view while respecting those of others.
Long-winded statuses about one candidate over another don’t change votes. What does need to change is how both sides interact.
It seems like most social media posts are less about creating discussion and more about propaganda for the author’s own purposes.
The ideologies of both sides can be taken to extremes, and they often are. There’s no middle ground — it’s just one end or the other. But even politicians themselves aren’t black and white on all issues, so why should voters be?
Having a reasonable and respectable discussion about the election doesn’t mean you don’t have a position. It means that you have more to hope for than a politician.

6-Nov-12,"Football practice report, Nov. 6: Theus at right tackle, Gurley urges team on","Two five-minute periods of practice were made available to the media Tuesday. The weather was a crisp 50 degrees. The team practiced on the lower turf fields today due to the inclement weather. The players were in sweat pants and sweatshirts beneath their pads and jerseys.

The lone green jersey on the field was fullback Merritt Hall, who is recovering from a knee injury.
The quarterbacks, tight ends and offensive lineman all worked with each other on play action. After the fake by the quarterback, the tight end ran a short-to-medium post route after releasing from their block. Arthur Lynch ran first team at tight end. Aaron Murray was at quarterback. John Theus was at right tackle.
The tailbacks and fullbacks worked on their quick feet and agility. They ladder-stepped over a set of blocking pads, getting their knees up waist high.
The inside linebackers worked on strength and explosiveness as they took turns hitting a blocking sled. The blocking sled was moved horizontally across the field to begin the second drill. In the second drill, the inside linebackers worked on reading the ball carrier coming out of the backfield and going to make the hit once they did that.
The wide receivers worked on their quickness and agility. They weaved through pairs of cones as their position coach, Tony Ball, was critiquing and encouraging his players.
The defensive backs worked on reading the ball carrier and attacking them coming out of the backfield. Secondary coach Scott Lakatos corrected any mistakes his players made in their repetition.
During the last three minutes of practice availability the first and parts of the second team offense scrimmaged against the second team defense. The offense ran deep fades to their outside receivers. On the ground, they ran draw plays. Todd Gurley was the first team tailback. Ken Malcome was the second team tailback, with Hutson Mason was under center.
Between snaps, offensive coordinator Mike Bobo called out the next formation as the players rotated in and out. The team’s overall cadence was very quick. The attitude was very upbeat on the sidelines. Todd Gurley was overheard telling his team, “We got to play at 120 percent. We got to move quickly.”

7-Nov-12,"Football practice report, Nov. 7: Ogletree takes first team reps at fullback, wide receivers work on agility","Two five-minute periods of practice were made available to the media Wednesday. The weather was a crisp 50 degrees. The team practiced on the lower turf fields today due to the inclement weather. The players were in sweat pants and sweatshirts beneath their pads and jerseys.

The quarterbacks and running backs worked together on executing handoffs from both the shotgun formation and under center. Aaron Murray, Todd Gurley and Alexander Ogletree were seen taking first team snaps. The fullback would block running backs coach Bryan McClendon, who was acting as the tight end, before tailbacks made a cut into a hole. McClendon kept telling his backs, “Good open step,” and “hammer the hole.” Keith Marshall ran two consecutive plays after bobbling the first exchange.
The wide receiving corps worked on its agility and cuts, as the wide outs would sprint about five yards before stopping and sprinting back the opposite way. The receivers ran back and forth four times before the next player would rotate in. Receivers coach Tony Ball constantly yelled, “tight, tight, tight.”
The offensive line worked on its blocking assignments as they went against a practice squad defensive line. Offensive line coach Will Friend yelled out the cadence, and the offensive line executed its respective assignment.
The inside linebackers worked on its coverage from the backfield. Those not participating on defense ran routes out of the backfield, which were covered perfectly every time.
The safeties worked on zone coverage, with Shawn Williams and Bacarri Rambo taking first team snaps. The receivers would run a variety of routes, most often crossing routes, where the safeties would stay in their zones and pick up the receivers. On one play Williams was one on one with a receiver and secondary coach Scott Lakatos told his senior safety, “That’s you all the way on that one Shawn. No help with that.”

8-Nov-12,New College of Education dean looking to increase visibility of college,"After a national search, the University named Craig Kennedy as the new dean of the College of Education on Thursday.
 
Kennedy, senior associate dean at Vanderbilt University’s Peabody College and a professor of special education and pediatrics, said he is excited about beginning his deanship at the college.


 


 
“The College of Education at UGA is an absolutely fabulous college of education,” he said. “I’m very humbled at the opportunity of being able to lead it and work with faculty, staff and students.”
 
Provost Jere Morehead, who announced the decision, said after the University search committee narrowed the candidates down to four, he chose Kennedy due to his background and trajectory.
 
“The Peabody College is the top school of education in the United States, and he’s held the position of being ranked the No. 2 person,” he said. “I thought bringing someone with that level of excellence to UGA would be positive.”
 
Morehead said Kennedy’s experience would enhance the college and add opportunities for the faculty. 


 


 
“His experience would provide a significant infusion of opportunities for our faculty here at UGA and would be a dimension that would add value to our faculty to what they’re already doing,” he said.

Aldon Knight, director of development in the COE, said the college is extremely happy with Kennedy as dean.
 
“I think Dr. Kennedy is going to be a fantastic leader,” he said. “He’s going to add a lot to what we already have in the College of Education.”
 
In the first few months of his deanship, Kennedy hopes to gain a better understanding of the college and University’s departments, staff, students and faculty.

12-Nov-12,Georgia basketball freshman combines athletic prowess with musical talent,"You could say it was a moment of divine intervention that brought Kenny Gaines to Georgia.
He had 23 scholarship offers from schools all across the country.
But Georgia's true freshman shooting guard was fed up with the headache of college basketball recruiting and asked for some help from the big guy upstairs.


 


“At the end of my recruiting process, I was kind of sick and tired of it and I wanted to get it over with,” Gaines said. “Me and my mom sat down and prayed one night, hoping that God would let me know because I wanted to make my decision pretty soon.”
What happened after could be considered one of the best-timed phone calls Georgia head coach Mark Fox has ever made.
“Five minutes after we got done with the prayer, coach Fox had called and I kind of looked at my mom at the side like, ‘Wow, that was pretty fast. He really answered us,’” Gaines said. “I chopped it up with coach Fox for a second and I knew that this was the place to be.”
That call allowed Fox to sign a 6-foot-3, 195-pound guard that had a reputation for being a high flyer.
Georgia’s newest shooting guard was crowned the Atlanta Journal-Constitution’s Slam Dunk Contest champion in 2011.
The winner is determined based on the number of votes each contestant receives each round from the online voting sessions. Needless to say, Gaines had a strong contingent from Whitefield Academy helping him out along the way.
“It was pretty exciting,” Gaines said. “I knew there was a couple of other high flyers in the contest. I honestly wasn’t expecting to win, but I pulled it out and it was great to be crowned the AJC dunk contest winner in 2011.”
When he’s on the ground, Gaines has an ear for music and an eye for fashion.


 


As a sophomore in high school he had to decide between taking the football field as an athlete, or during halftime as a member of the marching band.
Since he had experience playing the trumpet and piano, he chose the latter and joined Whitefield Academy’s drum line.
“I figured I would try to take my musical talents over to the marching band and help them out a little bit,” Gaines said jokingly.
His talents caught the attention of his instructors, and he was named Most Musically Talented in Band.
“It meant a lot. I kind of wanted to prove to other people that I was very versatile, besides basketball and sports,” Gaines said. “[I wanted to show] I could do other things, academically and through music. For me to get that award through music, I felt like my hard work off the court helped a lot also.”
His musical talents don’t lie with just instruments, either. Gaines has singing abilities that he is not afraid to show off.
A few weeks ago, he held an impromptu performance on the grand piano in the Oglethorpe Dining Commons, to show some of his teammates what he can do.
“Everybody was kind of shocked and looked at me like, ‘Whoa, this isn’t who we had scheduled playing,’” he said. “I got off and had a little round of applause.”


TNCMS.AdManager.render({region: 'fixed-big-ad-bottom-asset', slot: 1, fold: ""below""});


The song he performed was completely original.
“I played a song that I actually wrote. It doesn’t have a name to it,” Gaines said. “I’ve kind of just been messing around with it for a few years and decided to let it all on the line and play it for the people.”
His teammates gained a new level of respect for him after seeing him channel his inner John Legend.
“Yeah, he’s got some skills,” point guard Vincent Williams said. “He’s got some skills.”
His love for music doesn’t end with just the performance aspect. Gaines has an appreciation for fashion styles from the hip-hop industry and takes what he wears very seriously – down to the last detail.
“I’m kind of a weird person when it comes to stuff to wear,” he said. “I try not to express it; I just try to hold it down. I like picking little things here and there and letting it turn into a little outfit.”
If basketball doesn’t work out, Georgia’s dunk specialist is talented enough to land on his feet in a career that appeals to his biggest interests.
 “[I’d like to go] somewhere within the music industry. It’s either that, or fashion,” Gaines said. “Anything that’s tying those two together.”",YOUSEF BAIG,sports,https://www.redandblack.com/sports/georgia-basketball-freshman-combines-athletic-prowess-with-musical-talent/article_37c06a6e-2ce7-11e2-b0a8-0019bb30f31a.html
13-Nov-12,"Football Notebook: Georgia will evoke Saban's strategy against Georgia Southern, Garner says player safety must go both ways","When Nick Saban’s 2011 Alabama team beat Georgia Southern 45-21, he said it was a good game, but was glad it was over.
Saban — not known for being pleased with giving up 302 rushing yards — was referencing the difficulty of preparing for a triple-option offense, especially one run as fluidly as the Eagles’.
Georgia defensive coordinator Todd Grantham now sits in a similar position to what Saban faced only a year ago.


 


He hopes to use Alabama’s performance against Georgia Southern as a reference point.
“Last year, they went to Alabama and had 39 carries for over 300 yards,” Grantham said. “If you’re not ready for it, then they can get a lot of yards, a lot of points and make you look bad, so we’ve got to prepare and be ready.”
Much attention has been placed on the frustration of the “cut block” that the Eagles, and other triple-option offenses, utilize to run the ball effectively against typically larger defenders.
Bulldogs’ defensive line coach Rodney Garner knows it’s tough for players not to focus on being on the ground the whole game, but that returning to the basics is key to playing as efficiently — and safely — as possible.
“You try to work on the fundamentals,” Garner said. “That’s where the problem comes, when you’re out there worrying about the cut block versus doing the assignment or worrying about technique.”
With that said, defending this type of offense gives the defensive line an opportunity to tally up a hefty tackle total.
“Obviously this team is going to run the ball,” Grantham said. “In this game, you have a chance as a d-lineman to get a lot of tackles.”
Georgia’s defensive line coach thinks player safety is one-sided


 


With the number of concussions and other injuries mounting in the sport, there has been a valiant effort by rules committees to make the game safer.
Garner respects changes made to safeguard quarterbacks and defenseless receivers, but argues the protections are one-sided.
“If you’re truly concerned about student athlete welfare,” Garner said. “Then we need to make sure we’re looking at it from a safety standpoint on both sides of the ball.”
He said rules should be just as regularly made around the safety of defensive players.
“As we’re examining rules, we need to look and make sure the safety thing is on both sides,” Garner said. “Because there are safety issues on both sides, and there are some things that they need to look at for safety of the student-athlete.”

13-Nov-12,Recruiting recap: Georgia fighting for uncommitted five-star athletes,"There are still a few five-star recruits in the south that have yet to commit to a school, while one Georgia commit took a recruiting trip elsewhere over the weekend.
Four-star Alpharetta defensive end and Georgia commit Naim Mustafaa took a recruiting trip to Oklahoma State last weekend. Mustafaa is ranked first on Georgia’s list of commits and 20th on the nation’s big board. The defensive standout returned home Sunday night, and told Scout.com early Monday morning he saw a lot of things he liked on his trip to Stillwater.
“It was my first time there and they have great facilities, nice tradition and I really like the fan support they have there too,” Mustafaa told Scout.com.


 


The OSU coaching staff let Mustafaa know it wanted him, but he said he felt no pressure to change his commitment.
“Everything is still the same for me,” Mustafaa said. “I have always been committed to Georgia, but I did want to visit some other schools, and check out my other options.”
Mustafaa and the Raiders defeated Johns Creek 35-32 on the road on Friday. Alpharetta hosts Mill Creek in the first round of the Georgia state playoffs Friday night.
Mustafaa seems to have his mind made up at this time, but there are still numerous five-star recruits who have not made a final decision.
Columbia (Florida) offensive tackle Laremy Tunsil is the second-ranked prospect in the South (fourth overall) and remains uncommitted. Tunsil visited Alabama on Saturday and watched the Tide suffer its first loss of the season, but this did not change Tunsil’s opinion on Alabama.
Alabama is still high on Tunsil’s list, which includes Florida, Florida State, Louisiana State and Georgia. FoxSportsNext.com reported Tunsil’s recruitment will likely end in an all out battle between Alabama and Georgia on Signing Day. Though Alabama is high on Tunsil’s list, it was also reported that Georgia may have the early advantage.
Columbia scored 27 points in the second quarter to defeat non-conference opponent Suwanee 40-0 on Saturday.
Dooly County (Georgia) defensive tackle Montravius Adams is the South’s third-ranked prospect (seventh overall). Adams recently visited Clemson to see the Tigers breeze past Maryland 45-10.


 


Last weekend, Adams visited Athens, where he and his mother were impressed by Georgia’s performance as well as the individual attention they received from the coaching staff.
Auburn was the early leader on Adams’s list, but it has steadily fallen this season due to the Tigers’ play and lack of certainty in the coaching staff’s future. Alabama, Florida, LSU and Georgia are also on Adams’s list, with LSU having the slight advantage. This process will likely run into the new year and possibly even Signing Day. No edge has been given to this point, but Adams has reportedly shown interest in the in-state school.
Dooly pitched a 48-0 shutout at home against conference opponent Schley County on Friday.
Washington (Florida) outside linebacker Matthew Thomas is the South’s fifth-ranked prospect (13th overall). Thomas’s interest has remained with in-state schools Miami and Florida State. Thomas had his mind set on Miami last spring, but he started to show more interest in Florida State over the summer. Georgia and Alabama are still on Thomas’s list, but it is not likely that he will leave his home state. His decision will likely come down to Florida State and Miami.

13-Nov-12,Orlando running back recruit chooses Georgia,"Georgia football added another member to its 2013 recruiting class on Tuesday, with the commitment of four-star running back A.J. Turman.
Turman, a senior at Boone High in Orlando, chose Georgia over Florida State, Tennessee, Miami and Auburn.
Turman has great speed for his frame of 6-foot, 205 pounds. One of Turman’s best attributes is his power, and Fox Sports Next’s Jamie Newberg said it is this running back’s ability to drive his feet after first contact that sets him apart from other players at the position.


 


Turman has rushed for nearly 5,000 yards and 55 touchdowns in his career at Boone. He is listed as the 35th-best running back in the nation. Turman has often been left out of the spotlight this season due to great performances from fellow Florida running backs Derrick Henry (Yulee), Kelvin Taylor (Glades Day), Alex Collins (South Plantation), Greg Bryant (Delray American Heritage) and Ryan Green (St. Petersburg Catholic).
Turman will serve as another addition to Georgia’s already young running back cast of Keith Marshall and Todd Gurley.",ETHAN BURCH,sports,https://www.redandblack.com/sports/orlando-running-back-recruit-chooses-georgia/article_05deec8e-2dfd-11e2-b08d-0019bb30f31a.html
14-Nov-12,2015 Sugar Bowl to be televised by ESPN,"ESPN will have rights to the Sugar Bowl due to a 12-year agreement made between the media institution and the Southeastern and Big 12 conference.
 
The agreement will begin with the inaugural game between conference champions, in January 2015, and will continue through 2026. 


 


 
It was announced Wednesday by John Skipper, ESPN President, SEC Commissioner Mike Slive and Big 12 Commissioner Bob Bowlsby.",STAFF REPORTS,sports,https://www.redandblack.com/sports/sugar-bowl-to-be-televised-by-espn/article_3c845066-2e99-11e2-8c54-0019bb30f31a.html
15-Nov-12,SGA proposes HOPE-eligible freshmen pay out of pocket for first year,"If the reimbursement plan is passed, HOPE-eligible freshmen will have to pay out of pocket for their first year of college.
Sarah Beck, the external affairs director for the University Student Government Association, authored the recently passed SGA resolution. She said the idea originally came from SGA President Will Burgess. 
“We were on a conference call with a bunch of SGA presidents,” she said. “It was just about ways to save HOPE Scholarship. This is one of the last ideas we talked about, and the great majority of people thought this is something we should pursue.” 


 


The plan is HOPE Scholarship requirements will remain the same, but instead of receiving the scholarship money prior to beginning college, students who still qualify at the end of the first year will be reimbursed. The freshman reimbursement plan will go to the state legislature in the spring.
Since some students lose HOPE after their first year of college, this change would save the thousands of dollars that they would be awarded upfront for the first year.
Beck said this change emphasizes HOPE as a merit-based scholarship.
“HOPE is collegiate performance. It is not just high school performance,” she said. “We really want to emphasize collegiate performance, and we think this is a really great way to do that.” 
Aaron Klein, a freshman theater and advertising major from Dunwoody, said HOPE is significant for him and many of his friends.
“HOPE is very important,” he said. “Through high school, I wasn’t working hard so I could get into college because I knew that just with how I behaved, I was going to get into a decent college. I was working hard so that college would be affordable.”
Klein said he thinks the reimbursement plan is good in theory as a way to save the HOPE Scholarship.
“I think overall it is a good idea to make sure that the students who are actually going to work hard and earn a GPA in college get the money for HOPE,” he said. “I think that is a big plus.”


 


He said even though it could be an improvement, he has some reservations about the plan because it could keep students from going to college.
“I’m nervous that students who are smart and who would work hard to get the money for HOPE might be in a financial situation with their families where they don’t have the money to put upfront,” he said. 
Chelsea Merris, a freshman marketing major from Cumming, is also a member of SGA’s Freshman Focus. She also said the plan will not be a good solution for HOPE and has concerns about loans. 
“I think it going to deter a lot of kids from college just because they won’t be able to pay the money upfront, and they will have to get more loans in the first place,” she said. “That will just be really bad.”
Hope Rogers, a senior English and linguistics major from Lilburn, does not think the reimbursement plan is a good one. She is worried about student enrollment at the University as well as students’ financial situation. 
“It seems like a bad idea because HOPE is such a big attraction for students to come to UGA, and that could be gone,” she said. “Plus, for poorer students that could mean they have to take out loans the first year to pay, and they will end up paying a lot more because they have to pay interest on it.” 
Beck said the issue of interest on loans has not been specifically addressed in the resolution as a way to foster negotiation when it is taken to the state capital. 
She said the specifics of the plan are being kept vague because putting constraints on the conversation could keep progress from being made.  


TNCMS.AdManager.render({region: 'fixed-big-ad-bottom-asset', slot: 1, fold: ""below""});


“I think when you go in with a lot of caveats, you don’t really get a lot of stuff done,” she said. “HOPE should be an all-options-are-on-the-table kind of discussion because of such dire consequences, and HOPE is just a mess right now.” 
Beck said the resolution at this point is just a way to get the process of implementing the plan started.
“We started researching it, and we wrote a resolution in favor of it to get the ball rolling and be a leadership for the rest of the state on this issue in hopes that other SGAs would follow,” she said.",Taylor West,news,https://www.redandblack.com/news/sga-proposes-hope-eligible-freshmen-pay-out-of-pocket-for/article_919e850a-2eb0-11e2-83f9-001a4bcf6878.html

21-Nov-12,How to impress your boyfriend's family at Thanksgiving dinner,"What's the most dreaded thing about the holidays? Not Black Friday lines or recipes gone awry but meeting your boyfriend's parents for the first time.
No worries, I've acquired five easy steps to make your boyfriend's family as infatuated with you as he is.
Step One: Watch what you wear.


 


No one likes a floozy, and this remains true, especially for grandmas. Nanas like wholesome homemakers, not risqué ratchets. Lay off the neon nail polish and lay on heavy with the Southern charm. Chances are she'll adore you even more than your boyfriend does by the end of the week.
Step Two: Watch what you say.
No matter what you do, no matter what comes to mind, make absolutely sure you never utter the statement ""well my momma makes it this way..."" Nothing will get you blacklisted faster or broken up with more swiftly than talking about how much better your momma makes the dressing. Regardless of your intentions, it will always turn out badly.
And if Grandma feeds you absurdly large portions? Listen to me: receive them gracefully. She will always and eternally remember the girl who consumed the last bite of her sweet potato casserole. Sweetheart, eat every single bite.
And absolutely, certainly, ultimately remember that you have no political or religious affiliations when around the dinner table. That way you cannot lose.
Step Three: Watch what you do.
Regardless of their assurances to the contrary, his family is watching you. First impressions are key, and yours must be flawless.
First of all, no matter how mysterious Grandma's prized dish is, you must eat it (or at minimum move it around the plate). Your manners must be as exquisite as your eating habits. If your sentences don't end in ma'am or sir, you can best be assured you're not doing it correctly. And, for those special few whose eating habits are more sophisticated than theirs, be confident in the fact that he's dating above par and have no worries in the world.


 


Above all, be poised, compassionate and nonjudgmental. No one likes a know-it-all.
Step Four: Watch how affectionate you are.
A hand hold is cute, but a full-on make out screams trashy, and loudly at that. Trust me, his parents will feel strongly that y'all only get as passionate as a PG movie. If you display any behavior that wouldn't be approved on ABC Family, you can be confident that you won't be asked back for Christmas. Classiness isn't an option — it’s a necessity.
Step Five: Watch what you drink.
A glass of wine at Thanksgiving dinner is permissible, but a sloshed house Aguest does not a girlfriend make. Even if the rest of the family is acting like it's 1999, you should act as if it's you're drinking from a Communion Sunday thimble.
Even if you believe you have superior knowledge of holiday beverages, keep quiet and sip theirs in moderation.
So there you have it, ladies, the way to your boyfriend's family's heart. No matter how free-spirited or poor mannered or awkward you feel, these steps will ensure your integration into your beau's family.
Undoubtedly you will be seeing them again at Christmas — hopefully with open arms. But don't panic, there’s more to come on Christmas family etiquette.

26-Nov-12,Recruiting analysis: Georgia recruiting class takes shape over Thanksgiving weekend,"Georgia added three verbal commits to its list over the break, leaving a small number of slots to be filled.
Over the past week, Georgia added Kell High cornerback Brendan Langley, wide receiver Jonathan Rumph (from Holmes junior college) and safety Kennar Johnson (from Mississippi Gulf Coast junior college).
Langley is an athlete that could play on either side of the ball for Georgia. However, it looks like Langley’s talents will best serve the Bulldogs at cornerback. He has not yet been ruled out as a wide receiver, so Georgia fans should not be shocked to see Langley play a few snaps on the offensive side.


 


Rumph’s Scout.com profile describes him as a large target for the Bulldogs at 6-foot-5 and 205 pounds. Rumph could serve as a redzone target for Georgia immediately. Rumph’s profile also lists his speed as less than blazing, but fast enough for his role.
Johnson was a quiet target for Georgia for nearly nine months, but he has great range and size at the free safety position.
All three of Georgia’s recent commits are set to enroll at the University in January.
Georgia’s list of commitments stands at 30 with just over two months remaining until National Signing Day.
Georgia lost cornerback Steven Nelson in the same week it gained three commits. Nelson, a sophomore at the College of the Sequoias, recently received an offer from the University of Southern California and attended its game against Notre Dame this past weekend on his official visit.
Nelson has also received offers from Oregon State, Mississippi, Baylor, Houston, Kansas, Oklahoma, Middle Tennessee State, Kentucky, Texas Tech and Washington State. It looked like Nelson would commit to Oregon State after he dropped Georgia, but the addition of new Pac 12 schools put the Beavers on hold. Nelson is set to graduate in December and finished with 21 tackles and three interceptions this season.
Georgia still has spots to fill, and there are a few close battles it will have to win over the next two months in order to land its targeted players.
A few of Georgia’s top targets are defensive tackle Montravius Adams, running back Alvin Kamara, offensive tackle Laremy Tunsil, defensive end Toby Johnson and wide receiver JaQuay Williams.


 


Georgia is in competition with Auburn and Clemson for Adams, and he will continue to be at the top of Georgia’s list. It has been reported that the Dooly County product will choose the in-state school, but Georgia’s chances at this point are still only average. Auburn once had the upper hand, but Clemson has recently gained more of Adams’s interest. Adams’s decision will likely be announced in late January or on Signing Day.
Kamara’s choice will come down to Alabama and Georgia. Kamara is a quick running back with great hands, and his interest in Georgia is listed as above average. Kamara’s announcement is likely to come early next year.
Tunsil is another target who has high interest in Georgia, but Alabama is still a true competitor. Tunsil also has interest in Florida and Florida State, and the two in-state schools can never be ruled out for the Columbia [Florida] tackle.
Georgia has a good chance to land Johnson and Williams. Johnson recently suffered a knee injury, so he is likely to redshirt wherever he goes. Georgia is currently competing with Auburn, Nebraska, Oklahoma and Tennessee for Johnson. Johnson will graduate in December so his decision should be announced in the same month.
Williams committed to Auburn last year and Georgia could not change his mind. However, his interest in Auburn dropped which added Georgia and Texas A&M to the race. Williams is also set to graduate in December, so his decision should come around the same time as Johnson’s.
Georgia still has a wide range of prospects in mind, but those commits will evoke the most competition.",ETHAN BURCH,sports,https://www.redandblack.com/sports/recruiting-analysis-georgia-recruiting-class-takes-shape-over-thanksgiving-weekend/article_cfca2338-37ee-11e2-b74b-001a4bcf6878.html
28-Nov-12,Proposed plans for new UGA dining commons,"Bolton Dining Commons will be gone in less than two years. 
According to a proposal made Wednesday morning by the Assistant Vice Presidents for Facilities Planning and Auxiliary Services, the University plans to complete a replacement for Bolton Dining Commons by summer 2014. 
The $30 million project will place a two-story dining commons at the corner of Baxter and Lumpkin streets.


 


“It’s a prime and important part of campus,” said Assistant Vice President for Facilities Planning Danny Sniff. “It’s the nexus of the housing complex, MLC, Tate Center, Georgia Quad and Reed Plaza.”
Construction will begin on the 55,000-square-foot complex at the end of spring 2013, and Bolton Dining Commons will remain operational until its replacement is completed a year later.
The commons will include six food stations — three on each floor. Notable additions to the offerings include a bakery, an all-day breakfast line including a pancake bar and homemade milkshakes.
“By designing this with three platforms per floor, we are basically accomplishing building two restaurants on top of each other,” said Assistant Vice President for Auxiliary Services Michael Floyd.
The facility, which has yet to be named, will contain another first for University dining services – outdoor dining.
“The new Bolton will become a location, a destination as a gathering space to help build campus community,” Floyd said.
The dining hall will maintain the same hours as Bolton, though there has been discussion of offering services on Saturday as well.
The University hired Smith Dalia Architects and Bruner/Cott Architects and Planners to the project.


 


The building will feature a central rotunda at the street corner and will maintain a 55-foot easement from the street, surrounded by outdoor patios and pedestrian areas.
Future stages of building include adding a pedestrian bridge over Lumpkin Street, though this has not been planned yet.",Megan Ernst,news,https://www.redandblack.com/news/proposed-plans-for-new-uga-dining-commons/article_b4de9ef6-39aa-11e2-b1cb-001a4bcf6878.html
30-Nov-12,EDGES: Alabama vs. Georgia,"Georgia and Alabama head into Saturday’s SEC Championship matchup with the same record (11-1, 7-1 SEC). The No. 2 Crimson Tide and No. 3 Bulldogs are playing for the opportunity to play the No. 1 Notre Dame Fighting Irish on Jan. 7 in Miami for the BCS National Championship. The magnitude of this game couldn't be bigger.
Offense
Very little separates these two units, as they present mirror images in their respective backfields, boasting the country's top two quarterbacks in passing efficiency as well as spectacular duos at running back. While the Crimson Tide go with more of a ground-heavy approach, the Bulldogs have a tad more balance between the run and the pass, which gives them an (infinitesimal) advantage.


 


SLIGHT EDGE: Georgia
Defense
Georgia has played its best football of the season in its last five games, allowing a total of 45 points during its quintet of victories. Impressive though it may be, Alabama has played at that level for the duration of the season, posting four shutouts and leading the nation in total defense (233.7 ypg), scoring defense (9.3 ppg) and red zone defense (only a 61 percent conversion rate).
SLIGHT EDGE: Alabama
Special Teams
The Crimson Tide lead the Southeastern Conference in kickoff return average at 25.5 yards per attempt, ahead of the Bulldogs' 23 yards per return. Both teams have scored one touchdown on kickoffs this season, but Alabama also leads Georgia in net punting, punt return average and field goal percentage. While the Crimson Tide don't hold overwhelming leads in any of the special teams categories, it's enough to give them the nod here.
SLIGHT EDGE: Alabama
Coaching


 


Mark Richt is back in the SEC title game for the second straight year, duplicating a feat he last accomplished in 2002-03. Ironically, the coach he faced in that second consecutive trip in 2003 is the same one he'll face Saturday night: Nick Saban. Then, Saban was with LSU. Now, he's at Alabama, but regardless of the location, the Kent State alumnus has found success. Richt is on top in winning percentage (.750 to .733) among active coaches with at least 10 years of experience, but that's the only area he reigns over Saban. The Alabama coach has three SEC titles to Richt's two, capturing a pair at LSU and one at Alabama. The most glaring difference, of course, is in the national title department, as Saban owns three to Richt's zero.
EDGE: Alabama",RYAN BLACK,sports,https://www.redandblack.com/sports/edges-alabama-vs-georgia/article_a15ccca6-3b5b-11e2-94d2-0019bb30f31a.html
30-Nov-12,MATCHUPS: Alabama vs. Georgia,"Georgia and Alabama head into Saturday’s SEC Championship matchup with the same record (11-1, 7-1 SEC). The No. 2 Crimson Tide and No. 3 Bulldogs are playing for the opportunity to play the No. 1 Notre Dame Fighting Irish on Jan. 7 in Miami for the BCS National Championship. The magnitude of this game couldn't be bigger.
Aaron Murray vs. Alabama secondary
This would have been a battle to watch irrespective of other factors, but with his play in big games against elite defenses a constant topic, Georgia's starting quarterback decided to try to remove himself from the discussion this week. After he asked for and received permission to not fulfill media obligations, Georgia quarterback Aaron Murray was able to remove himself from any distractions that may have risen questioning by probing reporters. Given who he's facing, Murray will have to be at his best, which he has been over the past four games, throwing for 1,137 yards and 13 touchdowns against no interceptions. He'll be facing an Alabama secondary adept at taking the ball away. Both Robert Lester and HaHa Clinton-Dix rank in the top 10 in the Southeastern Conference for interceptions, with Lester snagging four and Clinton-Dix grabbing three. That's not even mentioning Dee Milliner, who ranks second in Crimson Tide history in pass breakups with 32. If Murray can keep the ball away from the Crimson Tide's defenders, it bodes well for the Bulldogs' chances at victory. If not, Georgia's task will become much more difficult.


 


Georgia offensive line vs. Alabama front seven
It's a broken record by now, but Georgia's big men up front were dominated by South Carolina's defensive line, not creating holes for the running backs nor giving time for Murray to find receivers in the Bulldogs' loss to the Gamecocks on Oct. 6. Though the line has played well in every game since then — aside from a five-sack first half by Ole Miss — Alabama will be a stiff test. The defensive line is led by Jesse Williams, he of the 600-pound bench-press fame. One positive for Georgia is that its offensive line is back to normal with the return of Chris Burnette. The junior right guard missed games against Auburn and Georgia Southern with a shoulder injury. Back in the starting lineup against Georgia Tech, the five-man rotation the Bulldogs have used in 10 of their 12 games this season — comprised of Burnette, center David Andrews, left tackle Kenarious Gates, left guard Dallas Lee and right tackle John Theus — regained a sense of normalcy. They'll need it against the Crimson Tide, who have posted four shutouts this season and lead the nation in a slew of statistical categories. Yet another number attesting to Alabama's defensive supremacy under head coach Nick Saban: in his 79-game tenure, the Crimson Tide have held opponents to less than 300 yards of total offense 52 times, or 65.8 percent of the time. If the Bulldogs want to break that 300-yard barrier, the offensive line will have to lead the way.

Georgia special teams vs. Alabama special teams
 In a game with such an even tussle on paper between both teams' offenses and defenses, expect the often-overlooked special teams unit to play a large role in deciding the victor. Just ask Georgia. Tyrann Mathieu, also known as ""The Honey Badger,"" single-handedly helped LSU turn around what been a bleak showing in the first half of the SEC Championship game last season. With the Bulldogs refusing to kick away from the electrifying cornerback, Mathieu scored on a 62-yard punt return, with a second topsy-turvy return that led to another Tigers touchdown, key plays into helping turn what had been a 10-0 deficit into a decisive 42-10 win for LSU. While there is no player quite as dynamic as Mathieu fielding punts for either team in this year's game, expect the special teams to figure prominently in the outcome, whether it's a booming punt or a clutch field goal by one of the teams' kickers.",RYAN BLACK,sports,https://www.redandblack.com/sports/football/matchups-alabama-vs-georgia/article_b4d31e6e-3b62-11e2-9973-0019bb30f31a.html
1-Dec-12,Alabama/Georgia: First Half Rewind,"ATLANTA — The first half of Saturday's Southeastern Conference Championship game was everything one would hope it would be. Big momentum shifts for both No. 2 Alabama and No. 3 Georgia kept the game close as it enters the second half, with the Crimson Tide owning a slim 10-7 lead.
The stage is set for an epic second half, with a spot in the national championship game awaiting the winner.
PLAYER OF THE HALF
Eddie Lacy
Alabama's junior running back was the top yard-getter in the first two quarters. He ran for 90 yards on nine carries, and had the Crimson Tide's only touchdown, breaking free for a 41-yard score to tie the game at 7-7.
PLAY OF THE HALF
Aaron Murray's interception late in the second quarter
Taking over following Alabama's first touchdown that tied the game at 7-7 with 1:59 to go in the first half, Georgia quickly got into its up-tempo pace and began to move the ball successfully. Murray completed back-to-back passes to Malcolm Mitchell and Tavarres King — for 14 and 10 yards, respectively — to give the Bulldogs first-and-10 at their own 49-yard line. But then, the play every Georgia loyalist feared came to fruition: Murray tossed his first interception since the Florida game. With Chris Conley open, Murray underthrew the sophomore receiver and landed in the arms of Alabama's HaHa Clinton-Dix. The Crimson Tide's sophomore safety returned the ball 35 yards while Murray was decked on a helmet-to-helmet hit by Alabama's Quinton Dial (no flag was thrown. Following the interception, the Crimson Tide went on to kick a field goal as time expired on the first 30 minutes, taking a 10-7 advantage into the locker room. Georgia looked primed to possibly get some points before halftime, but Murray's interception instead led to Alabama upping its total. If the final score ends in

5-Dec-12,UGA student becomes BBYO Fellow,"Emily Trotz, a third year marketing and international business major from Memphis, Tenn., has been given one of the nine BBYO Community Engagement Fellowships.
BBYO is an organization dedicated to “convening and connecting teens of all backgrounds who will become inspired to live Jewish lives” by connecting the teens through various community activities, according to its website. 
Trotz was selected from a pool of applicants to participate in the fellowship, an honor that requires her to act as a liaison between BBYO alumni and the organization as they hold and plan events on campus which are meant to strengthen ties within the Jewish community.


 


The Red & Black: How did you first find out about the Fellowship?
Trotz: I was actually a part of the planning process for the Fellowship. I helped create the idea for the Fellowship and spent this past summer working on the details for the program.
The Red & Black: When did you first get involved with the BBYO organization?
Trotz: I was very involved in the organization in high school and have remained close to the program as an alumna. Through attending numerous programs, conventions and events, I have remained close friends with many people I met in BBYO. 
The Red & Black: How do you feel now that you’ve been given this honor, and how do you feel about the Fellowship so far?
Trotz: I am thrilled to be working with the organization again. This fellowship offers the opportunity to connect Jewish students with each other on campus and reconnect alumni with each other. BBYO was an integral part of my high school experience, and I have really enjoyed my time as a fellow thus far.
Editor's note: In a previous version of this article, Emily Trotz was said to have received the B’nai B’rith Youth Organization Community Engagement Fellowship. BBYO is now an independent organization which is separate from  B’nai B’rith Youth Organization.

6-Dec-12,GENERATION ASPIRATION: University valued differently across campus,"Editor’s note: This is the final part of an ongoing analysis of the value of a University of Georgia education. You can read the first two parts online.
The best universities eat themselves.
They don’t just change — they swallow themselves, and in so doing, grind up everything that can’t bear the pressure of consumption.


 


Earlier this year, the University debuted plans to significantly renovate the heart of its campus: Bolton Dining Commons, the busiest of its four dining halls, will be bulldozed; the Terry College of Business, one of its most important professional schools, will expand down Lumpkin Street, taking the lot that once belonged to a fraternity.
There are rumors that the campus will then continue up Baxter Street in the years to come. These have some truth: the University holds the lease to several pieces of land up the hill toward Milledge Avenue, including where Domino’s Pizza now sits.
But what gets swallowed?
Terry would like to see its MBA program grow. Its professional reach is wide and needs deepening.
“A lot of employers do know about our program. I think our brand has pretty strong name recognition,” said Shannon Caldwell, director of the MBA Career Management Center. “I don’t think that that’s anything we can rest on and I know we work very hard cultivating those relationships.”
The Franklin College of Arts and Sciences, the largest college in the University, scales its principles of broadness for each of its thousands of students.
“We kind of look at the experience as a developmental experience,” said Jennifer Patrick, Franklin’s coordinator of Student Academic Services. “So we’re not only teaching students. We’re attempting to help them grow into adults. So that involves listening to them and letting them make choices, rather than dictating directions for them — helping guide them based on their own choices.”
There are services the college doesn’t provide but would like to — and may.


 


“May” is a good word for the Grady College of Journalism and Mass Communication as well, which sees itself as something of a bridge between Terry and Franklin, said Grady Dean E. Culpepper Clark: intellectually broad, yes, but professionally appealing, its students smart and savvy.
“In some way, Grady is a bridge between Terry and Franklin, in the sense that we deal in narrative storytelling ranging across all media platforms, and therefore what we aim to accomplish is to develop the writing and critical thinking skills that make for a lifelong journey,” Clark said.
Together, Terry, Grady and Franklin house more than half of all University students.
When discussing how best to educate — what to emphasize, what to prepare for, where to go next — their priorities become the priorities of more than 18,000 people.
Talking about the University’s value as a university doesn’t begin and end with these three.
But it’s a good start.
 
Where we’ve been


TNCMS.AdManager.render({region: 'fixed-big-ad-bottom-asset', slot: 1, fold: ""below""});


This year, the University made the list of Kiplinger’s 100 “Best Values in Public Colleges” — at No. 9, just behind a short-list of its peer and aspirational schools, including the Universities of Florida, Virginia and North Carolina at Chapel Hill (which was No. 1).
The University is no stranger to Kiplinger’s list, or similar lists such as Princeton Review’s “2012 Best Value Colleges,” where it sits at No. 8. But for the first time this year, the school was included on the list of “Public Ivies” by educatedquest.com, thanks to its affordability and the prestige of its Honors Program.
“Someone who is very bright that is from Georgia, who might be a HOPE scholar, who might know UGA is a Public Ivy, might say, ‘I’m going to go to UGA, and I’m going to take advantage of everything UGA has to offer,’” said Stuart Nachbar, the list’s compiler.
The University actually made a “Public Ivy” list before. “The Public Ivies: America’s Flagship Public Universities,” published by Greene’s Guides, included the school on its roster in 2001.
But this year’s selection not-being-a-first for the University is a sort of first for itself, and each announcement begins another conversation about the University’s worth.
Part of that conversation includes speculation. From a certain distance, talking about the University invariably involves talking about how much it has — and will — change.
“I think the combination of great leadership and HOPE Scholarship, demographic factors making Georgia one of the fastest-growing states in the country and the eighth-largest now, [and] the fact that, I think, close to half of students at UGA now, even if they’re in-state, they were born in a zip code outside of Georgia, so we have a lot of in-migration...You just look at the graining up of this campus and how beautiful it is since Dr. Adams arrived,” said David Williams, the associate provost and director of the Honors Program. “This beautiful Herty Field was a parking lot.”
Talking about changes invariably involves talking about the money that does — and does not — help make them happen.

HOPE, the state-wide scholarship that has supported a generation of college freshmen, faces pervasive restructuring in the face of dwindling revenue: it has to do less with less.
Meanwhile, this spring, the state University System’s Board of Regents approved a five percent tuition increase for the University — one of the smallest statewide increases in a decade, it claimed, but one of the highest individual raises of the year.
“We are still a good deal on a national scale, and HOPE is still among the strongest [scholarships] in the country,” said Tom Jackson, vice president of public affairs, at the time of the increase.
“Still” — but not always.
At the same time, there are more and more students looking to go to college, in-state or out.
At the same time, in a climate of rising tuition, budgets are being cut as the state has tightened its budget, year after year, in the face of the Great Recession.
At the same time, students, faculty and administrators on campus look to the question of value without a clear answer.
“Who’s to say [students] won’t opt for these bargains, atop the prestige of out-of-state universities, over an ‘average’ deal?” wrote Melissa Buckman, The Red & Black’s then-opinions editor, in April. “Who’s to say, after they attend these schools, that they won’t remain out-of-state for employment, thus contributing to the state’s already existent brain drain?”

Her institutional, the consensus of the paper’s editorial board, was entitled “Finding the worth.”
 
Where we’re going
Everyone has a way forward.
As the University’s liberal arts college, Franklin emphasizes the classic principles of a liberal arts education, Patrick said — “An education is different from job training.”
In this, the college encourages its students to take a broad view as freshmen and sophomores. Its Interdisciplinary Studies program, where students design their own major, whole-cloth, from multiple areas of study, is an example of this. CURO, the Center for Undergraduate Research Opportunities, is another.
But “we don’t see [education and career] as mutually exclusive on campus at all,” Patrick said. “Part of a liberal arts education is learning to speak, to read and to write. You’re going to need those things if you’re going to be a successful interviewee for any position. Filling out a job application and making grammatical errors is not a good thing.”
Williams believes in broadness, too, he said; in the past few decades, that broadness has spread to the Honors Program at-large.

When speaking with Williams about the program’s range of services present and future, he described a sort of educational clearinghouse, a one-stop shop for those students looking for Honors-level access to career services, research services — academic services, period.
Patrick said there are some services that Franklin would like to provide more of, too, including retention services for juniors and seniors (who don’t have any now).
But money — or “resources,” which is what everyone calls it on campus — is an issue.
Money is a problem everywhere: as a professional school, Terry is home to some of the highest-paid professors on campus, with salaries north of $100,000 a year.
Many of its goals are career-minded — the flip-side of Franklin. And, in this, it does well, with a professional reach that is wide and well-known.
But that reach could be reach-ier. According to a Bloomberg Businessweek survey of recruiters for its annual rankings of business schools, Terry had one of the strongest recruiting networks nationally, which helps move its students out along to employers and recruiters.
By that same rule, however, not every student is an ideal candidate for employment. They could use more hands-on career development and might benefit with more access to more services.
“Some of the things we need to do, we would love to do,” said Jill Walton, Terry’s director of undergraduate student services and corporate relations. “But we just don’t have as much money — and our aspirational schools are going to have a lot more than we would.”

More, more, more. Except money — not more of that.
Soon after coming in as dean of the Grady College, Clark helped plan a degree in media studies, which was ready for debut.
“Implementation was going to require additional resources, and of course we went into a resource trough within a year-or-so of my arrival [as dean],” Clark said.
Compensation has “flat-lined” at the college for the last five years, Clark said. Before that, the longest he’d ever gone was two years.
His vision is of Grady as a spectrum, educating students in storytelling techniques from fiction (mass media arts and the new MFA in narrative nonfiction and screenwriting) to non-fiction (the journalism degrees, from public affairs to magazines).
One of the school’s original founders saw journalism as a literary pursuit, Clark said. Its past has included drama critics as well as newspapermen. This is what makes the school up.
How is it that the University’s different colleges haven’t shown their strain more?
It depends on where you’re looking: in one way, Grady has borne its burden without much burden. The budget has flat-lined, but hasn’t decreased, because the University focused much budget tightening on general funds, instead of the $7 million a year it allocates to the college.

And, as Patrick said, there is a sense of working through, regardless: everyone works longer hours for everyone else; they use up what they don’t have. Franklin’s goals are, and remain, student-centered.
The University, still, is a placing for moving through.
“And I guess after all of these years, I came to one nub of a thought that sums up what our responsibility is in this college, what our responsibility is to our students, what the responsibility of faculty is,” Clark said. “And that is: Always leave a story better than you found it.”",Adam Carlson,news,https://www.redandblack.com/news/generation-aspiration-university-valued-differently-across-campus/article_3fb3ff7c-3f04-11e2-a93e-0019bb30f31a.html
7-Dec-12,Hydrophobia helps UGA researcher attack pollutants,"They’re everywhere, and they’re proving to be nearly indestructible — and humans made them.
Perfluorocarbon chemicals are used in everything from carpet manufacturing to firefighting, but the problem is once they’re released into the environment, they’re hard to get rid of.
Qingguo “Jack” Huang is an assistant professor of crop and soil sciences at the University’s Griffin campus. The U.S. Department of Defense has given him almost $700,000 to continue his research on a potential method for breaking down PFCs in the environment.


 


The reason PFCs are so hard to degrade is the strength of the bonds that hold the molecules together.
“These chemicals were designed by chemists to be robust,” Huang said. “They basically replaced all hydrogen atoms in the molecule with fluorine. That makes the chemical bond super strong and hard to break.”
The traditional method of trying to break carbon-fluorine bonds is by producing free hydroxyl radicals, which are highly reactive and attack bonds. Huang said the problem with this method is PFCs are afraid of water.
“The traditional oxidation process doesn’t work because these molecules are extremely hydrophobic,” he said. “The free radicals you are generating in the traditional ways — they like water. That’s why they don’t go together. That’s why they don’t tend to attack these molecules. We’re trying to design a new process.”
Huang has had laboratory success breaking down PFC bonds but is unsure why his method has worked, he said. He believes it is because his enzymatic approach creates hydrophobic free radicals, which can more easily attack hydrophobic PFCs.
Huang said the grant will help him “to understand better and also fully optimize the process, to make it work under real conditions.”
Because the chemicals don’t degrade easily, Huang said, there are many more of them staying in the environment — potentially getting into groundwater.
“Analytical capabilities have been developed so much over the years, so now we’re able to detect even when concentrations are so low,” Huang said. “That allows us to find that these chemicals are everywhere.”


 


The Environmental Protection Agency is in the process of determining if it will move to regulate PFCs. While no evidence has been shown that humans are significantly affected through exposure to these chemicals, they have proven toxic to animals in laboratory settings.
“I guess the biggest thing for me is: why do they use it?” asked Laura Eckhardt, a third-year dietetics and music performance major from Peachtree City. “The fact that I don’t know if there are any alternatives or any better alternatives, then I would be hesitant to just have it completely shut down.”
PFCs are used in making items both fire-resistant and friction-resistant — perfect for non-stick frying pans and firefighting foams. 
Huang said there are some alternative chemicals, and there are some companies who are beginning to use them voluntarily even though the EPA has placed no restrictions.
“Definitely the environment is important,” said Karsten Holmquist, a first-year international business major from Stockholm. “Obviously you don’t want to go out and say if it’s hurting you, you want to keep it on the market.”
Huang said one of the potential reasons the EPA has not moved to regulate PFCs on a wide scale — there are some individual states that have placed restrictions — is that there is nothing available to tell companies to use as a cleanup method.
PFCs often get into groundwater because of exposure at firemen training facilities, but Huang said firefighters probably don’t suffer from it.
“They may be exposed to this chemical, but just for a short period of time,” he said. “The [bigger] concern is that they are in water, and they are everywhere. The concern is the consistent exposure over a long time, to either human[s] or wildlife.”

31-Dec-12,MATCHUPS: Georgia vs. Nebraska,"Georgia and Nebraska head into Tuesday’s Capital One Bowl looking to rebound from disappointing conference championship game losses. The Bulldogs (11-2, 7-2 SEC) are still trying to recover from their national championship hopes being dashed five yards from the goal line against Alabama. The Cornhuskers (10-3, 7-2 Big Ten) look to forget about an embarrassing 70-31 loss to Wisconsin.
Georgia’s run defense vs. Nebraska’s ground attack
The Bulldogs’ defense has given up over 300 yards on the ground in three straight games, granted two of the three came against triple-option offenses that were unable to put any point on the board. With that said, Georgia’s struggling run defense was exposed in the SEC Championship Games, as it watched Eddie Lacy and T.J. Yeldon both march for over 150 yards. The task doesn’t get easier on New Year’s Day when the Bulldogs matchup against what Richt has labeled “the three-headed monster” of running backs Ameer Abdullah and Rex Burkhead, and quarterback Taylor Martinez. If the Cornhuskers manage to run wild, draft stock could be in serious jeopardy for the NFL-ready Bulldog defense.


 


Jarvis Jones vs. David Pollack's sack record
Jones’ time in a Bulldog jersey is expected to be coming to an end soon after the Capital One Bowl. But, before he’s finished, No. 29 has one last statement to make. He’s looking to surpass David Pollack’s Georgia single-season sack record. Jones is 1.5 sacks away, and has hinted that the record is all but his. With that said, the opportunity to get to the quarterback may be lessened by the Cornhuskers run-heavy offense, but Jones seems poised to make one last memory in a Georgia uniform. Interestingly enough, Pollack will be announcing the game for ESPN.
Aaron Murray vs. Nebraska's pass defense
Allowing less than 150 yards per game, the Cornhuskers sport the number one passing defense in the nation. However, they will be in for their toughest test of the season, as they go head-to-head with the second-most efficient quarterback in the FBS. Aaron Murray, who quieted — not silenced — many doubters against Alabama, still has much to prove to NFL scouts. Tuesday’s matchup against Nebraska could be a huge stepping-stone, though it would still be a huge surprise if Murray chose to make the leap to professional football even with an impressive performance.",BENJAMIN WOLK,sports,https://www.redandblack.com/sports/matchups-georgia-vs-nebraska/article_a96148c4-5374-11e2-8901-0019bb30f31a.html
1-Jan-13,Georgia/Nebraska: First half rewind,"Georgia jumped out to an early 9-0 lead in the first quarter, but Nebraska managed to battle back quickly. It was an exciting, back-and-forth affair 30 minutes that featured a blocked punt, a safety, three interceptions and eight penalties. The two teams combined for 564 and 47 points. The Cornhuskers took a 24-23 lead into the locker room and are set to receive to start the second half.
PLAYER OF THE HALF
Rex Burkhead


 


He doesn’t just have the best name in today’s game; he’s also been playing the best football. The 5-foot-11, 210-pound running back dashed for 70 yards on nine carries in the first half. He’s been a receiving threat out of the backfield, as well, catching four passes — more than any other Cornhusker — for 39 yards and a touchdown. Statistics aside, the senior Cornhusker has proved to be a tough guy to get to the turf, requiring several Bulldogs to join in on every tackle.
PLAY OF THE HALF
Georgia’s blocked punt for a safety
I couldn’t help myself. Sure, Tavarres King’s 75-yard touchdown catch on an underthrown Aaron Murray pass in double coverage may have been the best football play of the half, but the events that took place during Nebraska’s first punt of the game will certainly hog the game’s highlights — or lowlights, depending on how you look at it. Brett Maher took the snap to punt it away to Malcolm Mitchell when Georgia senior Shawn Williams slapped the ball into the end zone, where Justin Scott-Wesley was in position to easily recover the blocked punt. That was not the case. Several other Bulldogs raced to help their teammate, who as a result, lost control of the ball, and it slowly inched out of the back of the end zone. The end result — a safety, rather than an expected touchdown.
INTERESTING STAT
Aaron Murray’s first-half stat line
Georgia’s signal caller has thrown for 195 yards and two touchdowns, meaning he’s on pace for just less than 400 yards and four scores. With that said, Murray has completed less than 50 percent of his passing, connecting on only 11 of his 23 attempts. Two of those incompletions were interceptions — one being returned for a touchdown. So, what does Murray’s stat line mean? Well, we’re probably in for an interesting second half.

2-Jan-13,"Football notebook: Ogletree to enter NFL Draft, Grantham unhappy with officials","On fourth-and-nine — 1:08 remaining in the contest — Nebraska quarterback Taylor Martinez took the snap, and was quickly met by Georgia linebacker Alec Ogletree for the sack.
It was Georgia’s final defensive play of the game, and it would also mark the final moment of Ogletree’s career in a Bulldog uniform.
Following the game, he announced he was set to enter the 2013 NFL Draft.


 


“Yes, it was my last play here.” Ogletree said.
The tone in Ogletree’s voice was one of excitement for the next stage of his life, yet there was a sense of sadness in what he would be leaving behind.
“I had a great time while I was here,” Ogletree said. “I love everybody that I came to know. It’s going to be a tough one to leave behind, but you know, I feel like it’s the right decision for me.”
Defensive coordinator Todd Grantham, only slightly caught aback by his linebacker’s decision, spoke numbers about the legacy Ogletree would be leaving behind at Georgia.
“He’s a guy that can go sideline to sideline,” Grantham said. “He started out as a safety, and he’s a guy that can finish the game with a sack there at the end. He’s a pretty dynamic player; I love the guys. He’s done everything we’ve asked him to do.”
Grantham unhappy with Big 12 officiating
Before Grantham would answer any questions following Georgia’s 45-31 win over Nebraska, he wanted to get a clear point across.
He was displeased with the way the Capital One Bowl officials — a Big 12 crew — handled the fast pace with which the Cornhuskers offense moved.


 


“I really appreciate SEC officials,” Grantham said. “The operation of letting people with tempo snap the ball, and not let you get lined up is not really conducive to competitive play. Really I appreciate the way the SEC does it.”
There were several plays in which the Bulldogs were substituting players on and off the field as the Cornhuskers were snapping the ball.
“When you have to sub, you have the right to sub,” Grantham said. “There’s probably a handful of plays that were like that, but I really appreciate the way the SEC does it.”
Jarvis Jones breaks David Pollack’s sack record
In his 2011 season, Georgia linebacker Jarvis Jones came half a sack short from tying David Pollack’s single-season sack record.
After the game, he thought his 2012 season had ended with a similar fate.
He was unaware that he was awarded a sack for forcing an intentional grounding at the end of the first half to earn his second sack of the game.
“Really?” Jones said. “So, I got the record? Dang. Thanks I didn’t even know. Thank you.”

9-Jan-13,America was founded by proud GDIs,"The Fourth of July: a holiday revered for its barbecues, fireworks, patriotism and association with treasured summertime traditions. But more important than the red, white and blue bunting that dons every self-respecting American’s patio is the overriding theme of freedom — of independence. That day in 1776 marked a new era for an independent nation, and the season of warm weather and little responsibility often brings an air of personal independence from the demands of schoolwork.
Now let’s fast-forward to early August. Campus is once again bustling with activity and Rush week is coming to an end. Upon students’ final declarations of Greek affiliation, the term “independent” — which only a few weeks earlier was the topic of many Jim Beam-fueled chants — takes on a whole new meaning.
Sure, there is usually still whiskey or bourbon involved when it is shouted from the bed of a truck at any pedestrian walking down Baxter without Greek letters on their shirt pocket, but the preceding “god damn” makes the term sound much less appealing.


 


If the generally condescending tone of the label “GDI” isn’t harsh enough, the stigma that accompanies such a classification should do the trick. The 1984 classic “Revenge of the Nerds” created what may inaccurately be considered the textbook GDI, and non-Greek students have been fighting the reputation ever since.
But despite the negative connotation, I cannot logically comprehend why “independent” is an insult. My good pals Merriam and Webster suggest the main requirement to be considered “independent” is to be “not subject to control by others; self-governing.”
Sounds alright to me.
Even more interestingly, I quickly learned in my few months at UGA that GDI is not the direct inverse of fraternity or sorority affiliation. Although my Greek friends show pride and loyalty to their respective groups, they didn’t seem to appreciate when I asked how they were enjoying dependence. I only assumed that, since they enjoyed alienating me for my independence, they wanted me to take interest in their group’s existence.
I was wrong. After a few more blunders I finally figured it out.
Apparently referring to frat boys as “god damn dependents” was not the best way to get invited back to their parties.
“It’s brotherhood, not dependence,” one told me through gritted teeth.
I wasn’t going to argue; I can’t say I know enough about the social interactions within a particular fraternity or sorority to pass judgement. In fact, I support those who seek brotherhood or sisterhood, whatever that entails.


 


But for myself, I quite enjoy being notoriously independent. Of all of the terrible things I could be called, independent is not one of them. Every time someone refers to me as a god damn independent I smile just a bit, knowing that I am — at least in my metaphoric little mind — joining the ranks of George Washington and the other great independents that helped form our nation.

10-Jan-13,Democrats disingenuous on gun control,"With the fiscal cliff victory in hand, President Barack Obama now seems to be turning his attention to a push for extensive gun control measures. Several news outlets have reported, thanks to administration sources, that a team spearheaded by Joe Biden is considering a national gun database to monitor transactions, increased mental health checks and even increased penalties for carrying guns near schools.
These measures will probably enjoy a good deal of public support; a late December USA Today and Gallup poll found that 58 percent of respondents favored stricter gun control laws [“Gun control poll shows mixed results,” USA Today, 26 Dec. 2012]. The President has yet to explain how these proposed laws would be effective, and it seems that a convincing explanation of why these laws are now needed and how they will work effectively will not be coming any time soon.
The most obvious reason for the White House push is the Sandy Hook school shooting, but this proposed platform would have done little to preclude it. Nancy Lanza was, by all accounts, a law-abiding and model citizen, and any sort of database would only indicate that she was a gun enthusiast. Unless the President plans on using this database to spy on gun enthusiasts and monitor their children’s mental health, such a measure would have done nothing to prevent the Sandy Hook shooting.


 


Increased mental health checks may sound reasonable, but how far is the Administration willing to go? Outright commitment to an insane asylum would certainly have kept Adam Lanza from killing 27, but this is not something the administration has even touched upon, and seems unwilling to even discuss. Short of that, what does the President propose? That the government keep tabs on every pasty white kid who plays video games and acts weird?
The third proposed measure would almost certainly have had no effect on the Sandy Hook shooting, seeing as a homicidal killer is unlikely to forego a planned school shooting because carrying a gun is now more heavily penalized.
If the proposed measures are intended to curb gun violence generally, then that is another issue. Something you probably won’t hear from the administration is that the number of gun crimes per year in the U.S. has actually trended down since the early ’90s, a trend that most experts would almost certainly not contend was caused by any gun control measure. In fact, the 1994 Federal Assault Weapons Ban, which expired in 2004, did not do much at all to stop gun crime according to a 2004 University of Pennsylvania study [“An Updated Assessment of the Federal Assault Weapons Ban: Impacts on Gun Markets and Gun Violence, 1994-2003,” Koper].
Perhaps the creation of a national gun registry could help keep track of people who buy guns, but in a country with over 200 million legally registered guns this surveillance would be ineffective in reducing access to guns unless some sort of gun buyback or seizure program is also instituted.
This, of course, is something that Democrats are not as eager to talk about, for the obvious reason of political expediency. But those on the Left are simply more interested in expanding government control over our private lives than frankly admitting what would need to be done to seriously restrict access to firearms.

12-Jan-13,Left unfairly ousts Giglio,"On Tuesday, the Presidential Inauguration Committee announced that Atlanta pastor Louie Giglio would deliver the invocation at President Barack Obama’s inauguration. On Thursday, Giglio announced he was withdrawing from the honor.
Giglio’s abrupt withdrawal was precipitated after a left-wing group, ThinkProgress, dug up a 20-year-old sermon where Giglio vocalizes the church’s orthodox view on homosexuality. A summary of his remarks can be found here.
Activists pounced on the issue instantly, and Giglio bowed out less than 24 hours later.


 


“Louie Giglio out from Inaugural: Good” crowed the headline of a Washington Post blog post, wherein blogger Jonathan Capeheart traduced Giglio as an “unrepentant bigot,” and expressed his initial bafflement “that the Presidential Inauguration Committee would force Obama to share the stage with Giglio.”
You’d think he was being asked to share the stage with Ted Bundy. It goes without saying Capeheart was not alone in his metaphorical grave-dancing.
In the interest of fairness, you can find a civil variation of the liberal argument from the always-formidable Charles Hicks, here. I encourage you to read it.
For my two cents, the micro-storm over Louie Giglio seems part of an odd trend, and is indicative of the modern left’s — especially the campus left’s — narrowness of interests.
In 2008, inauguration invocation leader Rick Warren, an influential pastor from Southern California, was pilloried for his opposition to gay marriage. He hung on to the honor narrowly. (Could that have anything to do with President Obama’s insistence at the time “that marriage is the union between a man and a woman?” Just a thought.)
More recently, President Obama’s nominee for Secretary of Defense — the individual who confirms nuclear launch requests in his role as “deputy commander-in-chief” —, Sen. Chuck Hagel, has been opposed by some chiefly due to his past comments on homosexuality.
In the broader culture war (and at our school), activists have denounced a hobbled chicken sandwich salesman for his difference of opinion on the matter.
These episodes shed light on L’affaire Giglio, for on no other issue is the left so quick to litmus test, and so quick to denounce (in quasi-religious terms —“unrepentant”) those who fail.


 


This point is underscored by the other faith leader at the 2008 inauguration, black Rev. Joseph Lowery. Lowery made waves before the inauguration in 2006, when he used the pulpit at Coretta Scott King’s funeral to lambast the Bush administration — with President George W. Bush in attendance. Last year, while stumping for Obama in Monroe County, Lowery said “I don’t know what kind of a n****r wouldn’t vote with a black man running.” He then confided to his audience that he believes all white folks are going to hell.
Given his blatant racialism, it is incredible that Lowery skated through the inauguration process untouched while Giglio was practically burned in effigy. It reveals the issues that liberals are willing to go to the trenches for, and the beliefs they will not tolerate from the American people.
Louie Giglio is no culture war partisan; he is no hate monger. ThinkProgress had to turn the clock back to the mid-‘90s to find him on record about their issue at all.
Instead, he is a well-loved and loving pastor. Apparently that is not enough.
To his immense credit, Giglio’s Thursday statement included these words: “Neither I, nor our team, feel it best serves the core message and goals we are seeking to accomplish to be in a fight on an issue not of our choosing, thus I respectfully withdraw my acceptance of the President’s invitation. I will continue to pray regularly for the President, and urge the nation to do so (emphasis mine).”
If only others would display such grace.

20-Jan-13,Solar panels support strides toward sustainability,"The University of Georgia is headed towards a more sustainable campus environment.
In August 2012, the College of Environment and Design moved to its new location on Jackson Street, and with the new building came new renovations. The college added 72 solar panels on its roof as a new source of sustainable energy.
Kevin Kirsche, the director of sustainability in the Office of Sustainability, said the solar panels have been doing great since they have been added to the new building.


 


“The solar panels are an excellent demonstration of how we can use technology to harvest energy from the sun,” Kirsche said.
Alfie Vick, an associate professor at the College of Environment and Design, said that the solar panels have been a good source of energy for the college.
“I understand that the solar panels are producing about 30 percent of the energy use for the building,” Vick said.
Kirsche said sustainable energy is energy that isn't based solely on a fossil fuel-based economy.
“It generates energy in ways that are cost effective and doesn't have to cause harm to the environment and us since we are living in this environment,” Kirsche said.
Vick said sustainable energy is a step in the right direction at the University.
“I think it's imperative that we become better stewards of the resources we depend on,” Vick said. “And sustainability in rebuilding is one way to achieve that.”
The solar panels are connected to the building dashboard, so everyone can go in and see the energy production of the solar panels at any given moment, Vick said.


 


“I think the panels are are an example of renewable energy on campus, and something visible that everyone can see as they walk down Jackson Street,” Vick said.
The academic history of the College of Environment Design was supported by the solar panels, Kirsche said.
“Students are learning to design a physically-built environment that will reduce the negative impact on the natural environment,” Kirsche said.
Mary Alexander, a junior landscape architecture major from Cleveland, said she agreed the solar panels reflect the the goals of the College of Environment and Design.
“The college always strives to be more sustainable and the solar panels are just one example of that,” Alexander said. “In the future, I think the solar panels will influence the University to become more green.”  
The solar panels were purchased through MAGE SOLAR USA, a producer of U.S.-assembled and American Recovery and Reinvestment Act-compliant solar photovoltaic-modules, according to a previous Red & Black article.
“The solar panels generate approximately 30,000 kilowatt hours of electricity over the course of the year,” Kirsche said. “That's equivalent to 189 laptops operating all day every day.”
Kirsche said it will take less than 20 years to pay back the investment that was made on the solar panels.

23-Jan-13,Our Take: Obama higher education policy opens spending spigot,"President Barack Obama was sworn into office for a second term on Sunday, Jan. 20, in a reserved ceremony at the White House. He repeated his oath the next day before a crowd of roughly one million.
In that crowd were thousands of college-aged Americans just like us, eager (or perhaps uneasy) to see what President Obama will do for college students in the next four years.
Obama has already executed a number of policies targeted at college students and prospective college students, with the goal of expanding access to college by way of subsidization.


 


During his first term Obama doubled spending on Pell Grants, a need-based college subsidy. Federal spending on Pell Grants will total $34.9 billion this year. This is undoubtedly a boon for countless college students — more than one in four college students receives the Pell Grant.
The Obama campaign touted its changes to federal student loan repayment schedules, which it dubbed the “Pay As You Earn” plan. This plan lowers the cap on loan payments from 15 to 10 percent of monthly income, and forgives student loans after twenty years, from a previous 25. This change will mostly affect graduate students, who can borrow large amounts of money, but it will marginally affect undergraduates as well.
Also, in 2009 Obama passed the American Opportunity Tax Credit, a refundable tax credit of up to $2,500 that was included as part of the 2009 stimulus. During its first year, the AOTC provided $4 billion in government money to students with negative tax liabilities, and countless billions more in tax relief to students with positive tax liabilities. The fiscal cliff deal Obama brokered earlier this month extended the AOTC for an additional five years (it had been set to expire Jan. 1).
The crowd Obama drew for his second inauguration was roughly 55 percent lower than 2008 turnout, a manifestation, perhaps, of waning enthusiasm for the President amidst sky-high levels of debt and a stubborn unemployment rate of 7.8 percent.
However, Obama has undoubtedly done much to expand college access, and many University students benefit from lower tuition costs as a result. Legitimate questions remain about the net benefit of higher education measures that do not address the root issue of spiraling tuition costs, but policy quibbles aside, one thing is for certain: with young people accounting for 19 percent of the voting electorate in 2012 (a one-percent gain over 2008), college students are beginning to punch above their weight in terms of political clout.
Regardless of who occupies the Oval Office, that is an encouraging development.

23-Jan-13,Floundering feminism shows its age,"Upon reviewing the exit poll data from the 2012 presidential election, feminists were left scratching their heads. In all, 44 percent of women had punched the ticket for Mitt (He of the Female Binders), as had 56 percent of white women.
What in the world was going on? Didn’t they know there’s a war on?
The great swells of female Romney voters just don’t comport with campus feminism, which makes a mighty effort to find oppression and chauvinism — open wherever possible, latent and ready to spring to the surface crypto-fascist-style everywhere else — at every turn.


 


They cannot quite understand conservative females, because the straw man they’ve fluffed up and paraded around town about conservative gender policies is so foreign to the experiences of so many women.
According to the in-house narrative, the unofficial platform slogan of the Republican Party might as well be “Making You Unhappy,” executed by stern old stiffs with phrenological instruments and lukewarm, sexless marriages.
To be sure, promoters of this narrative have found willing accomplices in dunces like Todd Akin, but the point remains: campus feminism has largely convinced itself that ours is a medieval era, and declares itself shocked whenever women — their own foot soldiers — disagree.
This is so strange an attitude in part because of how much feminism has accomplished (you’re reading that right — yes, I said it) in so short a time.
In 1970, women earned 9.1 percent of bachelor’s degrees in business; by 2001, they were earning 50 percent of business degrees, and a clear-and-away majority of degrees in other fields.
Women compose 58 percent of undergraduates overall, and a narrow majority of graduate students.
And women are not just finding success in the aggressively progressive halls of academia. You wouldn’t know it from the media’s unquestioned wage gap totem, but the median full-time salaries of childless, single young women are 8 percent higher than those of young bachelors.
In our own city of Atlanta — the Capitol of the New South, assumedly home to wise-cracking good old boys and bulletproof glass ceilings — the pay premium is even higher: young women make 20 percent more than their male coevals.


 


And while some men may console themselves with locker room jokes about kitchens and sexy secretaries, the women they all know who are hard-charging past them toward success ensure that the punch lines fall flat as pancakes.
Today, many women are voting as pro-growth Chamber of Commerce conservatives, concerned more with clearing their own path to prosperity (and leaving the light on for future generations to find the way) than sweeping away the last tatters of the old regime.
Or perhaps, to the feminists’ eternal horror, these same women are voting Republican because they fundamentally agree with the conservative stances on social policy: with a non-arbitrary definition of human personhood as beginning at conception; with an acknowledgement that the male and female brains — stewed for decades in cocktails of very different chemicals — probably account for differences in interest and temperament between the sexes; with an understanding that no one has a “right” to free stuff, and especially not a “right” to compel another to go against his or her religious convictions.
Given the cartwheeling circus of boneheaded Republican candidates this election cycle, frankly it is surprising that Obama got so few female votes. And while there is some evidence of movement in the polls toward support of abortion, for example, the overall trend is encouraging, if unsurprising: women know that these are not the Mad Men, bra-burning days of the 1960s, and they’re acting in that knowledge.

24-Jan-13,Science classes sap fun from subject,"“But they don’t have anything to do, of course, because they’re theater majors.” I heard that the other day. It’s nothing unusual, and I’m sure you’ve heard it, too.
Science majors, on the other hand, are some of the hardest on campus. I think that’s the consensus.
Yet for all the terms we have to describe the fissure between the math- and art-oriented; the left- and right-brained; the logical and the creative, their subjects should all be working the same skills: reasoning, critical thinking, generating ideas.


 


In that regard, frankly, it’s my science classes that usually leave me disappointed.
So how different, really, is sitting in a 20th century American novel class from sitting in Biochemistry?
To tell you the truth, it’s very different. I can sit in an English class in Park Hall with 20 other people, read my books (and sometimes it’s a lot of books), have some discussions, write my three essays, take my midterm, take my final and walk out of there another checked-box richer on my DegreeWorks. But if I were a good English student, I would think hard about what I read, arm myself with a plethora of relevant information and finally come up with a brilliantly original idea that I would defend with impeccable logic that would take human understanding — through a graphic novel or comic strip or whatever — just one tiny step further.
But wait. That last bit is exactly what science is about, too.
I think it’s easy to forget that. Science and English seem very different because the former forces its students to sit in science lecture halls with 300-plus brave peers who are all trying to be a good Biology student. And they memorize, and they cram, and they dig through highly-technical information so that they can regurgitate enough, just enough, on the next exam. And then they forget it all.
Of course, English majors forget the significance of the novels they read, too. Trust me, I’m not saying the English department, or any department, has education down to a tee. But those keystone qualities like critical thinking, logical thinking, creativity, originality, resourcefulness and problem solving, are actually easier for me to identify in my humanities courses than anywhere else; and some of the science classes I’ve taken seem to have been reduced to an exercise in information processing.
This fact has left me gloomy before, but I know that’s not what science is about. Whoever is sitting in these lecture halls with me should be feeling the same vehement, vociferous outcry. It’s no one’s fault — not our professors’, at least. Maybe it’s just a misfortune of sheer numbers and information, MCAT preparation, GRE preparation — a vast pile of facts we simply must know.
But realize this — science is not about facts you must know.


 


Science is about taking human understanding just one tiny step further. Science is about that clean, simple experiment; the creative masterpiece that will alter the course of humanity.
It really is so simple. The greatest discoveries — Newton’s laws, Darwin’s natural selection, Mendel’s heredity — seem so elegantly simple. These people knew facts, but that’s not why they achieved what they did.
If you’re studying science, get excited about using your reason, about thinking of that beautifully simple experiment and about making discoveries.
Treat your sciences like you do your humanities. Learn their histories, their traditions, their methods. Learn the crazy stories chemists and biologists and physicists have lived doing what they do, because that is what’s fun about science.
If you’re unhappy poring over PowerPoint slides and textbooks memorizing phrases you highlighted because your professor said they would be on your test, well, you should be unhappy. No one felt like a scientist because they knew their amino acid structures.
But ultimately you should cheer up, because science in the real world is much more adventurous.

28-Jan-13,Sole UGA presidential search finalist Jere Morehead has ‘unmatched’ experience,"The University of Georgia Board of Regents announced UGA provost Jere Morehead as the finalist in search for the next university president Monday.
Morehead serves as the senior vice president for academic affairs and provost. He was appointed to this position in 2009 following a nationwide search process.
Since joining UGA as a faculty member in 1986, he also previously served as the vice president for instruction, vice provost for academic affairs, director of the Honor’s Program and executive director for the Office of Legal Affairs.


 


Morehead is also the Meigs Professor of Legal Studies in the Terry College of Business. He serves as faculty athletics representative and secretary of the Georgia Athletic Association board of directors, vice chair of the Research Foundation, a Foundation trustee and a Real Estate Foundation trustee. He received a law degree from UGA in 1980. He has won numerous teaching awards during his time on campus.
In a brief statement released Monday, Morehead indicated that more will be to come.
“I am honored and humbled to have been selected by the chancellor, the chairman and the Board of Regents as the finalist for president of the University of Georgia,” he said. “I look forward to making further statements regarding this wonderful opportunity to continue serving the University of Georgia after the board completes its process in the coming days.”
John Millsaps, the associate vice chancellor for media and communications for the University System said the next step is for the Board to set a meeting to confirm the finalist. A minimum five-day waiting period is required for public vetting before Morehead will be confirmed.
“This is part of Georgia law,” he said. “It’s a public period that allows the public to be aware of finalists for the position of presidents at Georgia’s public colleges and universities.”
The Board meeting will be announced as soon as a date is set.
Current UGA President Michael Adams expressed excitement in the naming of Morehead, with whom he has worked closely during his tenure.
“This is a great day for the University of Georgia,” Adams said in a statement released Monday. “The Board of Regents and Search Committee could not have found anyone more committed to the future of  this place than Jere Morehead. He is someone who has given the overwhelming majority of his life to the University of Georgia, and he will be a great and respected leader for many years to come. I wish him well in every endeavor.”


 


Other University administrators chose to wait to comment until the results were finalized.
“There’s process still to be involved, and I’d like to reserve my comments until the end of the process,” said Tom Jackson, vice president for public affairs.
Will Burgess, president of Student Government Association, found out Morehead was named as sole finalist in the presidential search through ArchNews, and was not surprised by the Board’s decision.
“I’m not at all [surprised],” Burgess said. “The provost has been very strong in his commitment to the students and the University as a whole. He’s a brilliant faculty member, great administrator and just a good person all around. He’s very good for the university.”
Marshall Mosher, vice president of SGA, is looking forward to working with Morehead due to their previously strong relationship.
“I’m extremely excited. SGA already has a fantastic relationship with Morehead and we’re really excited to continue that with our administration and the administration to come,” Mosher said. “He’s done an excellent job with this University and we’re excited to see what he does with his leadership.”
David Lee, vice president for research and executive vice president of the UGA Research Foundation, also said he looks forward to working with Morehead, based off of how past interactions have gone.
“As the vice president for research I have reported to him in his role as provost,” said Lee. “I have gotten to know him quite well and I’ve been very pleased at the level of support that he has provided for the research mission. He’s been very enthusiastic, very supportive of our efforts to encourage research across campus. And I’m sure he’ll continue that same spirit in his new role as president of the university.”


TNCMS.AdManager.render({region: 'fixed-big-ad-bottom-asset', slot: 1, fold: ""below""});


Lee said he does not know if he will be involved in the search committee for the new provost — there are many considerations for determining that panel — but he would be glad to serve.
David Williams, associate provost and director of the honors program, said he looks forward to working with Morehead.
“I could not be more pleased to learn that Provost Morehead has been named as the finalist to serve as our next president,"" Williams said. Dr. Adams said last week that no one loves the university more than does Jere Morehead, and I readily agree. He works tirelessly on behalf of the university every single day.”
Morehead’s experience at UGA is one of the reasons he was chosen as president, said Williams.
“I think his track record speaks for itself,” Williams said. “He’s very strong advocate for the University of Georgia and for our students and for our faculty. He has served in many roles, and performed very well in each of them, and I think the knowledge that he brings and the experience that he brings is unmatched.”
Joe Anderson, a junior majoring in economics, had been following the presidintial selection process and said he also feels as though the board selected a strong candidate.
""I am aware of the decision and I think it's an excellent choice,"" he said. ""I like the fact that they chose someone who both earned a degree and is currently employed at the University. I feel that Morehead will bring a much needed change of perspective to the University.""
Collin Montgomery, an advertising major from LaGrange, said he has been following the selection process a little less closely, but also likes the idea of someone from UGA stepping into the presidency. 

""He understands the clutlure of our University,"" he said. ""He understands our values and I'm sure loves the people, so he just wants to make it a better university for everybody involved.""
Ryan McLynn, a senior Foundation Fellow who works as an assistant to Morehead, said he saw Morehead's passion for UGA while working with him.
""I am very excited about Provost Morehead's selection as a finalist for the UGA presidency,"" McLynn said. ""Working under his supervision for two years, I saw his passion for the University of Georgia and its students on a daily basis. I cannot imagine a more deserving candidate.""
Vice President for Instruction Laura Jolly also commented on the high qualifications Morehead has for the role of president of UGA.
“He has just a strong commitment to excellence in everything we do in instruction to research to service,” she said. “And {he has a] real in depth experience in the University from, you know, just a range of positions that he’s held.”
But while Jolly offers her congratulations to Morehead, she notes that the process is not over just yet.
“I would just offer that congratulatory remark although the process is still on-going, you know,” she said. “The finalist has been named and the board of regents will take action at a future date, they said. So, it’s still in process.”
Morehead was selected from a short list of candidates recommended to the Board of Regents. 

In a tweet posted Monday, Professor of Journalism Barry Hollander called into question the process of naming an internal person as the only finalist. 
“I’m a fan of Provost Jere Morehead,” he tweeted. “But to name only one “finalist” for the UGA presidency strikes me as a bit provincial.”
Hollander told The Red & Black he feels that naming an internal candidate as the only finalist makes the search seem less broad than would be desired. 
“I think Morehead is a terrific choice as president,” he said. “By ‘provencial’ I mean that when you’re only finalist is an internal person, no matter how terrific he is, it makes you appear like your search really wasn’t a search at all.”
But Hollander, like Jolly and Williams, stressed that he is “a fan of the outcome.”
“I’m not complaining about the outcome,” he said. “I think the outcome is terrific. I’m suggesting the process doesn’t reflect well on the University’s reputation.”",Megan Ernst,uganews,https://www.redandblack.com/uganews/campus/sole-uga-presidential-search-finalist-jere-morehead-has-unmatched-experience/article_6c465f30-698e-11e2-80f7-0019bb30f31a.html

31-Jan-13,Welcome to the gun show: Georgia sees steady rise in gun ownership,"If January is any indication, 2013 is going to be a record year in Athens-Clarke County — for carrying weapons.“In all of 2012 we had 675 weapons carry license applications,” said Athens-Clarke County Probate Judge Susan Tate. “So far, this year just in January, we’ve had 160 carry license applications. Normally the average is 56 a month...so the average has tripled.”Mainly in response to the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in Newtown, Ct. and President Barack Obama’s memorandum on proposed plans for gun control, area residents have taken action. Tate said Clarke County Probate Court hasn’t seen a spike in applications like this since Obama’s first election.


 


It’s a feeling held by many Georgia residents, who have their sights set on gun ownership.According to a July 2012 report by the U.S. Government Accountability Office titled “GUN CONTROL: States’ Laws and Requirements for Concealed Carry Permits Vary across the Nation,” Georgia has approximately 600,000  carry permit holders as of Dec. 31, 2011. In the U.S. there were at least 8 million active permits to carry concealed handguns, meaning Georgia residents held 7.5 percent of those permits.Georgians hold adamant opinions on what guns mean to them as residents.“We in the gun business like to say without the Second [Amendment] there’d be no First [Amendment],” said Mark Franklin, vice president of Franklin Gun Shop in Bogart. “Because if private people have no right to control their own destiny and defend themselves from either tyranny or the assault from their fellow man, than what good are the rest of the rights?”State Rep. Charles Gregory (R-Kennesaw) is likely to agree.“Big government is the biggest killer of the 20th century,” he said. “And I don’t believe we’re on the verge of war or anything like that, but I believe that Second Amendment right helps keep us away from that...President Obama wants to infringe upon our civil liberties, he doesn’t believe in our natural right to self-defense. And I do.”‘Assault weapons didn’t exist in 1776’Part of the president’s plan for future gun control is placing a national ban on “military-style assault weapons and high capacity magazines” for civilians, according to the White House release “NOW IS THE TIME: The President’s plan to protect our children and our communities by reducing gun violence.”


 


A standard civilian issue assault rifle one would commonly find at a gun store is the AR-15, a semi-automatic rifle with a 30-round clip. This rifle is comparable to the military version M16 rifle.“Georgia is third in the nation in terms of hunting,” Franklin said. “Now remember, that assault weapon you’re talking about is a perfectly legal rifle for me to take coyote hunting or deer hunting in the state of Georgia. And a lot of people do that because it’s incredibly versatile.”Franklin’s mother Barbara, who owns Franklin Gun Shop, has an AR-15. Franklin used her as an example of why people use these types of weapons.“My mother shoots one and my mother is 70 years old,” Franklin said. “And she keeps one in her pickup truck when she runs the fence line of her farm, to make sure she doesn’t have stray coyotes...everyone has their reasons as I like to say.”But some have their reasons against guns.UGA student and former Navy missile technician Lazarus Roth said he believes there is no feasible reason a civilian would need an assault rifle.“If the fear is that there’s a police state coming or that the federal government is overstepping their bounds, then no, I do not agree that civilians should have access to military grade equipment,” said Roth, a 25-year-old junior philosophy major. “Regardless of if they’re ex-military or former cops, or avid gun enthusiasts that know how to use it...if you’re going to take the guns from one sphere, you have to limit the military might of the other, because that’s why a lot of people are standing in objection, that’s why they’re buying these guns.”And Roth said he believes some Georgians’ fear of a possible ban is caused by their outdated interpretation of the Constitution.

“Assault weapons didn’t exist in 1776,” he said. “They had breach loading muskets. You can have an assault musket, I don’t care how you jazz it up, but assault weapons didn’t exist.”Elberton resident Brian Collins is a father and gun owner who said he believes much of the assault rifle debate has been magnified by the media coverage of Sandy Hook, and that people are looking for justice in all the wrong places.“As far as the school shootings, my thoughts and prayers go out to these kids and the families of these kids,” Collins said. “I think what the problem is, is that people are trying to put the blame on the gun rather than the individual.”And Collins, being a father, said he understands their plight, but believes — if used properly — firearms are not the issue.“Of course I want to do everything in my means to protect my little girl for that matter,” he said. “And bond if she wants to go hunting and fishing, teaching her the proper way to use a firearm.”A Family AffairIn addition to the increase of permit applications in Georgia, many gun shops have seen an increase in sales. Franklin reported a 30 to 40 percent increase in December 2012 and a 50 percent increase in January.Some of Georgia’s fascination with guns, in Franklin’s opinion, stems back to the Civil War.

“Generally I think most of the United States is gun country and Georgia has a proud history of it,” he said. “I think it’s generally more ingrained in the southern states than it is in the northern states. We were the losers. We lost. Do you know why? All the heavy industry was in the north...so I think you have a generational thing going back that far.”Franklin was taught at a young age how to operate a firearm safely, by his late father and former Franklin Gun Shop owner Clarence Franklin Jr. His younger and older sisters learned how to use firearms as well.It’s experiences like Franklin’s many residents identify with. University student Mark Hadden was taught by his father and is accustomed to gun culture.“I grew up with my dad teaching me from a young age how to safely use a firearm, only under his supervision...he kept his guns in a place that I couldn’t access them at any time,” he said. “I think some people freak out because they just think guns are really dangerous, but it’s just like a car, it depends on how you use it.”Hadden has a carry license and takes it seriously, but he also doesn’t find many situations that demand it. Most of the time, he only uses his handgun with his father, at a range.“Let’s say I go out somewhere where it was legal to take a gun,” Hadden said. “I could go out there [and] take it with me, but if I felt the need to carry it with me and I have to do it for safety reasons, I probably shouldn’t go there...the people who carry a firearm, it’s something you use as a very last resort.”Not all families are the same.Julian Traas, a 22-year-old English major and dual citizen of the Netherlands and the U.S., grew up with a minimal exposure to guns. Bouncing between living in France, The Netherlands, Taiwan and Hong Kong until he was 15, Traas recalls seeing a firearm twice in his life abroad.

“The first time I saw a real gun outside of the movies I was 9 or 10,” he said. “We were the only people on this street in Paris and there were suddenly sirens...and these two cops jump out of the car...they pull out pistols and they seemed concerned and they just ran past us and onward. And I remember thinking, ‘Oh, a gun,’ and I was pretty frightened at the time.”His second experience was seeing Spanish soldiers holding assault rifles at a checkpoint in the Pyrenees Mountains between France and Spain. After moving to Alpharetta at 15, Traas’ experience with guns remains limited.“It’s really kind of weird,” he said. “Either I hang around depending on how you think about it, the right or the wrong crowd, or there have been people who’ve carried guns that I didn’t know about.”But when he does see them, he said he can’t help but feel slightly nervous.“Every time I see someone with a holster, I always go, ‘Ah, s---. Someone has a gun,’” Traas said. “Somewhere in the back of my mind I wonder if it’s going to become a situation. This is the first time I’ve seen civilians with guns. In France it was the police and in Spain it was the soldiers...here it’s everyday people, and that’s something I’m still trying to get used to.”‘When seconds count, the police are still minutes away’Days after the Sandy Hook shooting, Gregory set into motion House Bills 26-29, which call for drastic changes in Georgia gun controls laws.“House Bill 26. The purpose of this bill is to eliminate the licensing requirements to carry conceal in the state of Georgia and maintain the licensing structure for purpose of reciprocation with other states,” he said. “And it’s based on my belief that you shouldn’t have to ask permission to exercise your God-given right.”

If passed, residents would no longer need a concealed carry license in the areas that previously required them. In addition, HB-29 would remove concealed carry restrictions at places of worship and college campuses. For Gregory, the decision to allow guns on campuses and churches should be left to the property owners.“You don’t check your civil rights at the door when you walk on a college campus or at church,” Gregory said. “I want it to work the same way it would work for any other property in the state...it’s not about forcing anyone to carry weapons or forcing a property owner from allowing something they’re not comfortable with. It’s about the individual rights of the property owner and that extends invariably to the person who is carrying.”Hadden said he is inclined to agree with the passing of HB-29.“If somebody came into a church with a gun the police are minutes away,” he said. “But when seconds count, the police are still minutes away...but these places like houses of worship and college campuses, the police can only be at so many places at one time, so the personal protection comes down to the individual citizen.”Georgia law requires handguns be stowed in a locked container or compartment of a motor vehicle, unloaded, while on a college campus.“If I can’t go on campus carrying a handgun I think that’s unfortunate, because I don’t think the law makes sense,” Hadden said. “Let’s say I’m on campus or a guy walks onto a bus with a gun. My unloaded gun locked away in the car is not going to be much help at that point, so I don’t think it makes sense to have it in my car.”Hadden said he believes a concealed carry license holder can act as a “first responder” if needed. And Gregory said he doesn’t see a potential danger to his bill.“There are people walking around with guns everywhere else,” Gregory said. “To be honest, there are probably people walking around your campus with guns now, but I don’t know.”

Gregory used the shootings at Virginia Tech and Aurora, Colorado as examples of what can go wrong in places that restrict concealed carry holders from packing.“Every time that there is a major mass-shooting, it’s in a gun-free zone,” he said. “Gun-free zones are places that crazy people can go to shoot fish in a barrel because they know that nobody else is going to have a gun...and just the threat or the potential of someone else having a gun is a deterrent.”Roth and Traas both said they disagreed with HB-29. And even though Roth is a man who has used various firearms in his five years in the Navy, he has not used a gun since his crossover to civilian life — and he doesn’t plan to.“I just don’t care to. I have no need to,” he said. “I live in suburbia. The most dangerous thing I’m going to deal with in Athens is people that don’t know how to drive.”Roth said he believes students shouldn’t carry weapons on campus, and went as far to say he believes UGA should have no police officers“We don’t know what it’s like not to have University police here,” Roth said. “Of course you’re going to assume that because it’s normal that it’s good, but who can remember not having a police force on campus? Just because it’s normal and because you’ve accepted it as so, you have the notion that it’s safe, but you don’t know what it’s like without it.”What Roth said he does know to be true, in his heart, is that many Georgians love guns. And Traas, who’s adamantly anti-gun, said he is scared of the future to come if HB-29 is passed.“If it’s on all campuses in the state, I’d leave the state,” Traas said. “I would look at each individual school’s policy to see where to attend.”

And amidst the national gun control debate and the possible passing of HB 26-29, he reflected on the things he’s seen in the news and talked about with his peers.“I can see people’s point when it comes to self-defense,” Traas said. “But the question still remains: If everyone owns guns are we really safer?”Editor's Note: In a previous version of this article, weapons permits obtained by Georgians were referred to as ""concealed carry permits.""

31-Jan-13,Morehead 'deeply committed' to UGA,"Jere Morehead has a simple “stump speech” — stellar students, stellar faculty and stellar facilities.
And now, as the sole finalist in the University of Georgia’s presidential search he has the chance to make it happen. 
Who he is


 


Jere Morehead has been at UGA since 1986. Except that one time — 1995 — when he taught at the University of Michigan as a visiting professor. But he makes up for that by also having attended UGA for law school.
He’s a pretty big Dawg fan. Jennifer Frum, UGA vice president for public service and outreach, used stronger words.
“I’ve never met anyone more deeply committed to this institution,” she said of Morehead. “It’s his life. He spends all of his time thinking about the University of Georgia.”
SGA President Will Burgess said Morehead has “a love for this university that very few have.”
David Williams, director of UGA’s Honors Program, said he “lives and breathes UGA.”
Morehead joined the UGA administration in 1998 and has held multiple positions including vice president for instruction, vice provost for academic affairs, director of the Honors Program and executive director of legal affairs. He has been senior vice president for Academic Affairs and Provost since 2010.
Morehead began employment at UGA as a professor in the Terry College of Business in 1986. He was awarded UGA’s highest teaching distinction, the Meigs Distinguished Teaching Professor, in his subject of Legal Affairs in 2001. He still holds this position.
He is a vice chair of both the UGA Research Foundation and the Georgia Athletic Association and a trustee of UGA and the UGA Real Estate foundations.


 


In addition to his history with UGA, administrators said they felt his personality will translate well into an effective presidency.
“He’s a details person — he really wants to understand way things work,” Frum said. “He’s highly engaged with faculty and staff. He understands internal workings of this university as well as the workings of the state itself. I genuinely look forward to continuing to work with him.”
Griff Doyle, vice president for governmental relations, said the continuity of bringing in someone who’s already “well known and well respected” will be an advantage to UGA.
“Don’t have enough good things to say about him, and that’s from the heart,” he said. “All of the public officials, both appointed and elected that I’ve spoken with at the federal, state and local level welcome him to this position with excitement and anticipation. He’s an asset one for being person he is, and also because there’s no orientation required, we can really hit the hit ground running.”
Williams said he thinks Morehead “wins people over.”
“He is extremely warm and personable. He’s a gentleman,” Williams said. “I think he wins people over. Not through artifice of words or anything, he’s just genuine — and genuine in his commitment. He is just a quiet, steady, inspiring leader.”
In this year’s State of the School address, Adams said he hoped the next president would serve a long term like he did. The average term for a university president is six and a half years — Adams has been at UGA for 16.
Williams said he thinks Morehead’s commitment to UGA will keep him around for a while.


TNCMS.AdManager.render({region: 'fixed-big-ad-bottom-asset', slot: 1, fold: ""below""});


“To my knowledge, Jere is fully at home,” Williams said. “I don’t see him going beyond this to do anything else. He has been dedicated to this place since 1986, if not before. I think that he senses that our story is not done here. I think we’re still in our ascendancy, therefore there’s a lot of work left to do.”
The future of UGA 
Williams also pointed out Morehead’s focus on UGA’s “three primary missions” — academics, research and outreach.
“I don’t think we could possibly have a president who embraces all three primary missions more than him,” he said. “There’s a temptation to see him as primarily focused on the students, but he has without a doubt proven that he is interested in all three of our missions.”
Morehead’s background does emphasize his connection to academics. Burgess said Morehead’s candidacy is “great” because of his “clear commitment to students.”
“He’s promised to meet with us over the transition to make sure he’s continuing to address student issues through the process,” Burgess said. “The best indicator of the future is the past and at over the last two [SGA] administrations, the Provost has made his commitment to students a high priority.”
Morehead’s focus on the academic aspect of UGA encompasses more than addressing student issues, Burgess said.
“He’s done such good work on the academic side of things to bring more value to our degree,” he said. “I think that’s where his real value is — he’s well respected in academia so I think this will only be an upward trend in that sense.”

David Lee, UGA’s vice president for research, said Morehead’s résumé shows strength in commitment to undergraduates.
“One of the reasons that Provost Morehead is so highly regarded is because of his unambiguous commitment to undergraduates and their experience at UGA,” Lee said. “It’s really been the hallmark of his career.”
He also has experience with faculty hiring initiatives, Williams said. He’s also had experience as Provost both with external hires and promoting from within.
“If you get an external president, I think it’s a truism that they want to bring in their own deans and vice presidents,” Williams said. “We’ve got the advantage here of continuity. But I think Jere is also somebody who dares to take the steps necessary to move forward.”
Williams said Morehead’s weakness used to be research.
“He probably would point out himself that his weakness going into being Provost was the research mission because he had not been exposed fully to all of what that means,” Williams said.
Now he’s a pro, Lee said.
“In his role as provost, he’s been extraordinarily supportive of the research agenda,” he said. “So I believe that it will certainly be part of his agenda to advance the university’s research reputation. I also expect there will be a strong focus on research and how we improve it and graduate education, which is really the heart and soul of our research enterprise.”

Frum said Morehead has a history of support of the public service mission too.
“In his role as Provost he has been incredibly supportive of the public service mission and the university’s role in state as the flagship land grant institution,” she said. “Provost Morehead is very interested in supporting us and engaging academic faculty in our mission across the state. I know he has as one of his priorities making UGA as responsible as we can be to some of state’s key issues.”
Another key component to life as a university president is fundraising. Mac Corry, associate vice president for development, said “just because [Morehead] hasn’t been in a role that specifically had fundraising spelled out as part of the job description” doesn’t mean he doesn’t have experience.
“I would probably argue the point that he does have extensive fundraising experience particularly in his previous role as head of honors. He also engaged in fundraising as provost,” Corry said. “He has longstanding relationships that he’s built over years with some of the university’s significant supporters, and has been helpful in many ways over years in facilitating gifts even during his time as provost.”
Williams said Morehead’s focus on fundraising isn’t “in the bragging rights.”
“I think he sees fundraising as contributing to the primary missions,” Williams said. “He’s very interested in need based scholarships right now. He’s very interested in building endowments for professorships. He’s interested not in bragging rights but in the impact and effect of fundraising.”
As director of the Honors Program, Williams said he’s looking forward to see what Morehead will expect from them.
“I think that instead of him seeing, ‘Oh let’s boost Honors,’ I think he sees Honors as something that can contribute to the whole,” Williams said. “We can harvest best practices from honors and harvest what honors does well and bring it to student body as a whole.”

Williams repeated the concept of contribution to the whole while talking about Morehead.
“I mean that sums it all up. Nothing’s in isolation. Everything’s contributing to this greater whole, and I think that’s what Jere’s focused on.”",Megan Ernst,uganews,https://www.redandblack.com/uganews/morehead-deeply-committed-to-uga/article_a9cd552a-6b50-11e2-b4e7-001a4bcf6878.html
1-Feb-13,Police blotter - Feb. 1,"UGA student charged after reportedly urinating behind a tree
A University of Georgia student was arrested and charged with possession of a fake ID, obstructing a law enforcement officer and underage possession Friday at 2:04 a.m., according to a report from UGA police.
The reporting officer saw the offender, identified as Erik William Gossett, 19, in the old Chi Phi parking lot between two vehicles. Gossett reportedly urinated behind a tree near the vehicles. He walked away from the officer at a “brisk pace.” The officer asked Gossett to stop and talk to him, but Gossett ran away and the officer followed on foot. Gossett “refused to comply” and continued to run through the lot.


 


The offender reportedly exited the old Kappa Alpha parking lot and fell “forward on his hands and face in the middle of Wray Street.”Gossett continued running onto Waddell Street when the officer could not see him anymore. The officer radioed descriptors for Gossett and a perimeter was reportedly set up around the Wray-Nicholson House to search for him.
 At 2:47 a.m., the officer saw Gossett walking south on Newton Street. The officer noticed “abrasions” on his hands and face as well as “mud on his pants and a small cut in his shirt.” 
Gossett reportedly refused to speak with officer and refused to provide identification. The officer reported the smell commonly associated with alcohol coming from Gossett’s person.
Gossett was reportedly placed under arrest and searched. His UGA ID was found on his person, which was cross-referenced and revealed that Gossett was under the age of 21. A valid license was also found on his person. Gossett was transported to the Clarke County Jail.
Gossett was unavailable for comment to the Red & Black.
 
UGA student charged with underage possession and fake ID possession 
A University of Georgia student was arrested and charged with underage possession or consumption of alcohol and possession of a fake ID Friday at 3:50 a.m., according to a report from UGA police.


 


The reporting party, a University Housing Security guard in Creswell Hall, reportedly told the officer that Shahil Kirankumar Patel, 19, had “tried to gain access” to the dorm using his credit card and ""appeared intoxicated.""
The reporting officer made contact with Patel and asked him about the situation. Patel reportedly said he had been downtown drinking. 
The officer asked for identification and Patel said “he did not have one.” The officer reportedly asked to look through the offender’s wallet, where he found a Georgia driver’s license belonging to another individual. Patel admitted that the license “belonged to his cousin and he uses it to get access into bars in downtown Athens,” and to buy alcohol.
A GGIC check revealed that Patel was under 21 years old. Patel reportedly said he was “wrong” to drink downtown. The officer noticed the smell commonly associated with alcohol coming from Patel’s person while he spoke.
Patel was arrested and refused to provide a sample of his breath. Patel was then transported to Clarke County Jail.
Patel was unavailable for comment to The Red & Black.
 
UGA student reportedly charged after 'beating on door' at residence


TNCMS.AdManager.render({region: 'fixed-big-ad-bottom-asset', slot: 1, fold: ""below""});


A University of Georgia student was arrested and charged with public intoxication, disorderly conduct and criminal trespassing Friday at 2:49 a.m., according to a report from Athens-Clarke County Police.
The reporting officer responded to a call from a residence off Oconee Street in reference to “a male subject beating on a door at that location.” The individuals inside, three women, had sought refuge in a back bedroom, according to Central Communications.
The officer approached a white male outside the entrance to the apartment complex who reportedly “appeared to be trying to make a phone call.” The officer reported that the man, identified as Stephen Parr Lambert, 28, was unsteady on his feet.
Lambert told the officer that he had come from “the dark apartment” and made a motion toward the apartment that had made the call.  He was reportedly “trying to find his friend that lived in that apartment.” Lambert said that he had knocked then proceeded to pound on the door with his fists. The offender also stated that he had come from The Winery downtown where “he had a few drinks with friends.”
According to the report, Lambert took a phone call from a friend during the investigation and proceeded to put the call on speakerphone and converse with the person on the other line.
The officer asked Lambert if he was on probation or parole, to which Lambert reportedly said that he was on probation for two DUI convictions. The offender also reportedly indicated that “abstaining from the consumption of alcohol” was a condition of his probation.
The officer asked Lambert “how he would feel if that had been his residence” and someone had done the same to his door, to which Lambert replied that he would’ve been “alarmed.”
After officer surveyed the residence, they reported that the offender had “kicked in the door” at the location due to physical evidence of a shoe print matching the shoes of Lambert.

Lambert was placed under arrest and transported to the Clarke County Jail.
Lambert declined to comment to The Red & Black.
 
UGA student reportedly charged for DUI
A University of Georgia student was arrested and charged with a DUI Friday at 2:43 a.m., according to a report from Athens-Clarke County Police.
The reporting officer stopped a vehicle coming from downtown at a DUI checkpoint on North Avenue near Willow Street. The officers asked the individual, identified as Kayla Diane Schmandt, 22, to provide her driver’s license, which she located after a “minute” and gave to the officers. An officer reported a “drunk look on her face,” and noticed the odor of alcoholic beverage coming from the vehicle. Schmandt stated that she had two beers downtown earlier.
Schmandt pulled over to the side of the road upon request and complied to take field sobriety tests.
After completing the tests, Schmandt was reportedly placed under arrest was transported to the East Precinct Station for a breath test. The samples came out at 0.209 and 0.210. The offender was then transported to Clarke County Jail.

Schmandt was unavailable for comment to The Red & Black.",Emily Schoone,cops,https://www.redandblack.com/cops/police-blotter---feb/article_2010a41a-6cd4-11e2-bbb2-001a4bcf6878.html
2-Feb-13,Safe ride conference brings new possibilities for Designated Dawgs,"The annual Safe Ride Program United Conference will be hosted by Designated Dawgs in Athens Feb. 1 to Feb. 3, 2013, according to a University of Georgia press release.
Designated Dawgs is the UGA student organization dedicated to giving students and members of the Athens community a safe, free drive home without judgment.
SRPU serves as a centralized union for safe ride programs at different universities across the country, giving those groups a support system and information source.


 


The conference itself will be comprised of representatives from approximately 10 universities, with three to four student representatives from each university.
“It’s a great way for us to see different membership structures,” said Patrick Klibanoff, executive director of Designated Dawgs.
Klibanoff also said seeing the different ways the other organizations handle the logistics of a safe ride program is extremely helpful.
Caring Aggies R Protecting Over Our Lives, Texas A&M University’s safe ride program, will be one  group the Designated Dawgs team can take notes from at the conference.
CARPOOL proudly calls itself the first student run safe ride program in the country, said Colby Jackson, director of expansion for CARPOOL.
Founded in 1999, CARPOOL has safely taken over 200,000 students as of the spring 2012 semester with its 300 members that cycle duty throughout their Thursday to Saturday weekends.
“One ride is one possible life saved,” said Jackson. 
Along with its primary organization members, Designated Dawgs welcomes volunteers to assist in getting students home and provides insured cars to do so.


 


In order to drive a car ushering people home, a volunteer must be 21 years old. Those under 21 can be navigators who help the driver find the residences, allowing them to focus more on the road.
“Our main goal is to get people home,” said Klibanoff.
Some of the biggest challenges Designated Dawgs has faced, Klibanoff said, is building awareness amongst students, ensuring that students feel comfortable approaching the group for help and finding enough volunteers to get students home.
CARPOOL too faced problems spreading awareness in the beginning, but Jackson said minimizing the group’s legal risk was their top bump along the way.
With downtown Athens heavily populated by bars, one might think the volunteers of Designated Dawgs would have their hands full.
“Everyone was excited to get a free ride home and not have to walk in the cold,” said Megan Wood, a sophomore student who volunteered one night with Designated Dawgs during the fall 2012 semester.
Wood, who served as a navigator, said she and her driver took approximately 30 students home that night and all of them were appreciative and nice.",Stephen Mays,uganews,https://www.redandblack.com/uganews/safe-ride-conference-brings-new-possibilities-for-designated-dawgs/article_8d6036aa-6cdb-11e2-b3d0-0019bb30f31a.html
2-Feb-13,Be it Resolved: Disney Princesses are good role models,"Editor’s Note: This is the fourth installment of a series authored by members of the Demosthenian Literary Society on resolutions debated at their meetings. Two sides of the resolution — an “affirmative” and a “negative” — will be presented in each installment. The Demosthenian Literary Society meets Thursdays at 7 p.m. in Demosthenian Hall.
Affirmative:
What comes to mind when you think of the Disney Princesses (and not just the Princesses, but all of the Disney heroines)? Is it their kindness, their generosity, their willingness to help others?


 


It’s a common refrain that these young ladies show the children that watch them, especially little girls, that they should be subservient, compliant, docile creatures who blindly do whatever they’re told and wait for things to happen to them instead of being proactive and independent. Upon further consideration, however, it becomes apparent that is not the case.
Disney Princesses are graceful and intelligent, spunky and brave. Ariel, The Little Mermaid, has an insatiable natural curiosity. The Frog Princess’s Tiana has lofty ambitions and is willing to work hard to achieve her goals.
Belle, of Beauty and the Beast fame, is an avid reader. Additionally, she stands her ground but is also forgiving. When the Beast is unkind to her, she refuses to yield to him until he learns to be nice, and then she forgives him his previous misdeeds. She has the fire to match his temper and isn’t afraid to use it against him in her own defense.
Even the non-royal princesses, Mulan and Pocahontas, for example, have admirable qualities every individual should aspire to — bravery, athleticism, an appreciation for nature and natural beauty that is too often absent in today’s world of steel and concrete. These are traits that should be nurtured in children and, indeed, all individuals.
These girls, these Disney ladies, show their admiring fans that in order to make their dreams come true, they have to persevere. They have to go through struggles and hardships and come out the other side stronger for what they have endured.
Negative:
These women (or in most cases, girls; Snow White is merely 14, and the eldest, Cinderella, is thought to be no more than twenty) are completely unrealistic. They set ridiculous, blatantly untrue expectations about life, love and what should be done to achieve happiness and security in life.
Even a cursory glance shows that these Princesses have laughable body proportions, more like a Barbie than a human (and we already know the issues that particular false celebrity has caused), and the Disney Princesses are some of the women little girls aspire to be like in every way.


 


They lead our children to believe the path to happiness is as simple as marrying a rich man and wearing a ball gown to a midnight dance. That they can and should throw away their whole lives, abandon their talents, disregard their family and friends and disobey their parents, for the sake of a man they have only ever glimpsed once. That they should slave away their days cooking in kitchens and dancing around with brooms and mops, cleaning.
Some have even argued that Disney’s sole purpose in creating the Princess franchise is merchandise, pure money, and the only reason they exist is so that little girls will beg their mothers and fathers for the next sparkly pink accessory.
Finally, until Disney released Brave’s Merida (who won’t even be an official “Princess” until June of this year), the main lesson these movies try to shove down the throats of little girls is that they won’t be happy, won’t succeed in life, without a man at the end of the road.
Each of them has to get their prince, and there would be no story without that goal in mind.

4-Feb-13,"On anniversary of Columbia disaster, America should redouble space effort","President John F. Kennedy once said, “We choose to go to the moon. We choose to go to the moon in this decade and do other things, not because they are easy, but because they are hard.”
In September 1962, Kennedy gave a speech at Rice University in Texas, propelling the United States into the era of the space race. The space race seemed hard at the time, but when Neil Armstrong took his first step on the moon in 1969, anything seemed possible.
Nearly 40 years later, the United States was still greatly invested in the space program.


 


On January 16, 2003, I remember going to school and walking into my third grade class to find the television on: a space shuttle, the Columbia, was going to take off!
I remember all of us staring at the television, waiting on the edge of our seats to hear the final countdown. In the last few seconds before it lifted off, my class rushed outside and hurried to the back of the school with a couple of other classes to try to spot the Columbia.
I grew up in Camden County, the most southeastern county in the state of Georgia. Camden is right against the Florida border, and the Kennedy Space Center at Cape Canaveral is about three hours away, so I grew up being able to see space shuttles from my back yard if it was a nice clear day or at least an orange streak of a shuttle’s exhaust on a clear night.
By the third grade I had watched a good many space shuttles go up from my backyard, but this time it was really special to me: it was my ninth birthday.
As long as I can remember I always wanted to be an astronaut. I loved the idea of space, and one day I wanted to walk on the moon and touch the stars. The idea of exploration beyond my wildest dreams excited me — I wanted to be part of it.
We went outside that morning after hearing lift-off at 9:39 a.m. and started searching the sky to the south, we saw the Columbia and its white tail behind it. I remember us kids cheering and waving at it so the crew might “see” us. They might not have been able to see us waving at them, but I had a smile so large and wide across my face that they might have seen the sunlight glinting off it.
For my birthday — or, rather, shortly after — one of the presents my parents gave me was the Columbia space patch. I loved this patch, as it reminded me of going outside with my friends and teachers to see the space shuttle. For the Career Day at my school I remember wearing my dad’s Navy coveralls with the sleeves and pant legs rolled up, my space patch pinned to my chest just like my heroes, the Columbia astronauts.
That Saturday morning, Feb. 1, I came home from a school function and turned on the television to see the news: the Columbia did not make it home — it and its seven passengers had been destroyed. I was distraught. I cried. That was the first time I realized my dream — my wonderful and exciting dream — was also dangerous.


 


Ever since Kennedy said America must shoot for the moon not because it is easy but because it is hard, his words still ring true 40 and 50 years later.
Even though the space shuttle mission ended in disaster, Americans Rick Husband, William C. McCool, Michael P. Anderson, David M. Brown, Kalpana Chawla, Laurel Clark and Israeli Ilan Ramon succeeded in another way.
These brave men and women worked for the love of space and exploration. It was hard to continue after the disaster, however it was necessary in order for America to make new and wonderful discoveries in space.
These astronauts were and still are my heroes today, one week after the tenth anniversary of the disaster. They were a wonderful example of bravery and strength.
I hope the best for the future of America and the space program at Kennedy Space Center. As Kennedy said, “Well, space is there, and we’re going to climb it, and the moon and the planets are there, and new hopes for knowledge and peace are there. And, therefore, as we set sail we ask God’s blessing on the most hazardous and dangerous and greatest adventure on which man has ever embarked.”

7-Feb-13,Downtown fashion boutique beats out competition,"Tucked away on College Avenue behind a nondescript wooden door is the face of an online giant.
The Red Dress Boutique, which opened its storefront on Sept. 15, 2005, is now fifth in the nation for the most traffic of all independently owned online boutiques. It stands behind only ModCloth, Nasty Gal, LuLu’s and GoJane.
The online website first went live on Dec. 6, 2009. It has grown 700 percent in the last 12 months. Using Facebook as its main marketing tool, the store is constantly updating and posting photos to communicate with customers.


 


Last January, the Facebook page had 10,000 “likes.” It now has over 93,000.
“We don’t know where all of our Facebook friends came from,” said Diana Harbour, owner of Red Dress Boutique. “A friend ‘likes’ a page, then other friends see it, they’ll like a dress — it spreads like that.”
Red Dress Boutique has a cult following. Every photo, every status, every notification has comments from women all over the country asking about sizing, prices, color and shipping.
“It’s crazy that we’re number five and how Diana just started this business not ever dreaming of that, but it’s really cool,” said Ashley Chambers, a sophomore from Waynesboro majoring in fashion merchandising. Chambers has been modeling and working at the store since April.
The online store has nailed a niche of a product that has been difficult to find.
“Each of the top five websites have branded themselves, and we just fit a niche for that classic woman that’s true in how a girl or woman dresses everyday,” Harbour said.
The store selects pieces to sell for diverse occasions, from an interview to traveling to a date.
“We’re not just giving one look — we’re trying for 10 to cover all aspects of a woman’s life at a really affordable price,” Harbour said.


 


But that still doesn’t explain how a little store in Athens grew to have the online presence Red Dress Boutique has today.
“I actually started Red Dress on eBay under Athena Boutique,” Harbour said. “That was in 2004. When we decided to move to Athens, Athena was already taken by a jewelry store, so I had to change the name.”
So she and her husband opened the downtown store a year later and dropped the eBay account.
“I missed being online, so we started the website,” Harbour said.
One out-of-state customer first heard of the site through a blog.
“I live in a small town in Vermont, so I don’t get to go shopping in boutiques too often unless I want to make an all-day trip out of it,” said Stella O’Donnell-Leach, a Red Dress customer from Lyndonville, Vt. “The styles [at Red Dress] are very on-trend and fun.”
The store receives 300 to 500 online orders a day from all regions of the country. But Harbour guesstimated Texas to be the state it ships most to, saying the appeal of what it sells fits Texas.
There are different factors to consider when you are selling clothes online versus in a store.


TNCMS.AdManager.render({region: 'fixed-big-ad-bottom-asset', slot: 1, fold: ""below""});


“We have to sell it by a picture online, so you have to qualify that price just based on that picture,” Harbour said. “Online, we try to cap it at $75. If we find a coat with great texture and quality, that is pretty much the only time we will deviate from the $75 price point.”
While the cap is at $75, you can find many of the boutique’s tops from $40 to $50. Some earrings are as low as $12.
Harbour is aware that girls dress for girls. At age 31, she said she still gets dressed knowing she will be examined from top to bottom by critical female eyes.
“I measure the cost of an outfit like weighing it against how many compliments I get on it,” Harbour said.
Chambers believes it is the store’s interactiveness that makes it stand apart from the other boutiques in Athens.
“We have a lot of online contests, ‘share this’ items, ‘you can win it,’ ‘get a $15 coupon,’ things like that,” Chambers said. “We put ‘thank you’ cards in all of our orders — we personally write them.”
A customer favorite is the “Be the Buyer” part of the online presence. Every two weeks, when Harbour travels to the West Coast to buy more clothes for the store, she posts pictures to the Facebook page with her iPhone, asking customers if they want to see the items online.
“They don’t take themselves too seriously,” O’Donnell-Leach said. “They’re always trying to include the customers in the say and they choose fun pieces to sell.”

Chambers acknowledged the benefits of “Be the Buyer” in making the customers feel involved in the decision making process of what to sell in the store.
Red Dress Boutique also utilizes Pinterest as a way to spread the word about clothes, jewelry and shoes available online. It seems every other day, there are new arrivals on the website.
“I think they excel at constantly rotating new products in, using social media and really wanting to please their customer base,” O’Donnell-Leach said.
Although it has grown into a major online shopping boutique, Red Dress never buys mass quantities of any pieces, typically only three per size per item.
“We don’t order a lot,” Harbour said. “We treat the website like a boutique. We don’t order 500 of an item.”
With the online store’s popularity, Harbour has negotiatws with the post office for the past four months on beginning international shipping. She said she plans to start with Canada and the islands around the United States, then South America and hopefully Europe.
“There’s no limit on growth online,” Harbour said.

7-Feb-13,"Signing Day rewind notebook: Richt recovering from hip surgery, Grantham talks defensive recruits","Head coach Mark Richt had hip surgery last week after injuring it on a swing set nearly 20 years ago.
In November, he said he suffered the injury while trying to impress his wife, Kathryn, when the chains for one side of the swing came undone and he landed directly on his hip.
The pain became too much to bear, and he decided he would undergo surgery to repair it.


 


“I’m very thankful that I’m up and moving around good,” Richt said. “I know people knew that I had a little surgery done. It went very well, I feel very good – a little bit better than I thought I’d be feeling today. That’s a blessing.”
The original plan was to have the operation after National Signing Day so that it would not affect recruiting, but SEC commissioner Mike Slive wanted him to have it sooner.
“I was going to do the surgery after Signing Day, but to be real honest about it, there’s an SEC head coaches meeting that is coming up next week and the commissioner thought it would be really important for me to be there,” Richt said. “I pushed things up just a little bit.”
With various rules in place for when coaches can and cannot contact recruits, Richt said he didn’t miss a beat even with how close the surgery was to Signing Day.
“There’s a quiet period, and a dead period and all that kind of thing, but I was able to really do the same thing from my home with the telephone that I could’ve done in the office,” he said.
Georgia’s head coach is supposed to use crutches, but decided to walk without them when he saw the cameras.
“My wife will be mad to know I walked in without crutches because I told her I was, and she said, ‘Don’t do it,’” Richt said. “Then when I was walking in I had a bunch of cameras on me with crutches, so I threw them off the side and started walking. If I fall down, I know whose fault it is.”
A new Green at wide receiver


 


Early enrollee J.J. Green from Kingsland, Ga. did just about everything a player could do in high school.
The 5-foot-8, 171-pound athlete played running back, wide receiver, cornerback and returned kicks at Camden County.
In his senior season alone, Green recorded 39 tackles, 3 interceptions, 1 sack, 919 rushing yards and 16 total touchdowns.
He said has been working with wide receivers coach Tony Ball since arriving on campus in January, but hopes to contribute at as many positions as possible.
“I’ve been working with coach Ball a lot here,” Green said. “That’s where they’ve got me right now, but I mean I’m probably going to be all over the field. I like it like that. It’s pretty cool just knowing that you’re going to be out here just to ball and be like a Brandon Boykin type – just going about your business.”
Green’s résumé makes a compelling case for competing for the spot as the kick returner as well.
“Return game – I think I broke Georgia’s state record in kick returns,” he said. “It’s pretty awesome knowing that I could do that too.”
He shares a name with one of the best receivers to ever play in Athens, and while they might look similar enough to be mistaken for brothers, he joked that the size difference is enough to differentiate gene pools.


TNCMS.AdManager.render({region: 'fixed-big-ad-bottom-asset', slot: 1, fold: ""below""});


“If somebody probably said my name right now in the stadium, somebody would probably just think he’s my brother,” Green said, “but I’m pretty much on the short end, so they’ll be looking like I don’t know [about that].”
Grantham breaks down defensive recruits

Georgia defensive coordinator took some time off from taking questions about his possible future in the NFL to talk about the Bulldogs' 2013 defensive signees.
The biggest news Georgia received on signing day was a signature from Chamblee pass rusher Davin Bellamy.
""He's a big guy,"" Grantham said. ""When you look at his growth and growth potential at a certain position, I think he's a guy that can be a mismatch.""
Another top signing for Bulldogs was 5-foot-10 Sandy Creek cornerback Shaq Wiggins, the 39th-ranked prospect in the nation by ESPN.
""Shaq's awesome,"" Grantham said. ""Shaq's a shutdown guy. Shaq's got excellent body movement, quickness, transition back to the ball. He's a tough guy. He's got ball skills. He has the right mentality to play the spot.""
Grantham also praised the physique of defensive line signees John Atkins and Chris Mayes.
""I think they're big athletic guys,"" he said. ""Anytime you can get big people in your program and you can work them and you can get them into a conditioning program... is something that will greatly benefit them moving forward. So I look forward to working with those guys this spring.""

OT commit reminds Richt of Cordy Glenn, nicknamed “Scooter”
One commitment that did pick the Bulldogs on Signing Day was offensive tackle DeVondre Seymour, a four-star prospect out of North Gwinnett High School. He is also the cousin and adopted son of former Georgia standout Richard Seymour.
Seymour drew the praises of Coach Mark Richt during Wednesday’s press conference for his physical talent and high growth ceiling.
""His nickname is ‘Scooter.’” Richt said with a slight chuckle. “We think Seymour is an outstanding player. He kind of reminds me of Cordy Glenn with his size and his athleticism. He's definitely a guy that we've liked and recruited all along. As it turned out at the end there was space to make it work, so we signed him.”","YOUSEF BAIG, CY BROWN & ALEC SHIRKEY",sports,https://www.redandblack.com/sports/signing-day-rewind-notebook-richt-recovering-from-hip-surgery-grantham/article_882eef28-714f-11e2-b4ff-001a4bcf6878.html

A University of Georgia student was charged with a DUI Sunday at 2:35 a.m., according to a report from Athens-Clarke County Police.
The reporting officer pulled over a car traveling in the wrong direction on Lumpkin Street. When the officer made contact with the driver, identified as Carly Noel Moore, 22, he noticed that “she was not looking at [the officer] when she talked” and that her eyes were “glassy and bloodshot.” He also noticed the smell of an alcoholic beverage coming from her person, according to the report.


 


When asked how much she had to drink that night, Moore reportedly said “not much because she was the DD.” The officer pointed out that there were no people in the car with her. Moore then said that she had had “two or three Bud Lights.” She complied to performing a series of field sobriety tests.
Her breath reportedly tested “positive for alcohol” at .108, and she was placed under arrest for DUI. Moore was transported to the East Police Department for the intox. The first sample was invalid and the officer waited 20 minutes before the next retest, which registered a .131 and .130. Moore was transported to the Clarke County jail.
She declined to comment to The Red & Black.

19-Feb-13,Our Take: UGA's apparent censorship of green organization should not be taken lightly,"Updated with response from Vice President of Public Affairs Tom Jackson (see below)
It's no secret that the topic of green energy is dominant on college campuses.
The University of Georgia has countless student groups dedicated to renewable energy sources, including UGA Go Green Alliance, the Environmental Law Association and Sustainable UGA.


 


The latter even has a recycling event modeled after the now-famous Gangnam style video — a real treat, if you haven't seen it.
But UGA, even as it hosted the inaugural SEC Symposium this weekend to discuss the role of the Southeast in the future of renewable energy, wasn't able to escape controversy.
Here's the backdrop: UGA, fresh off securing the right to be the first host of the SEC Symposium, selected Heather Hatzenbuhler and Ian Karra to be its student ambassadors to the event. 
Hatzenbuhler and Karra are environmental activists and leaders in the Sierra Student Coalition at UGA, which opposes the university's use of an on-campus coal boiler.
The event brought in representatives from all 14 of the Southeastern Conference schools to discuss renewable energy.
However, a picture that was taken of Hatzenbuhler and Karra posing with UGA President Michael Adams and Provost Jere Morehead, seems to have been edited, in a glaring way.
The students' ""Beyond Coal"" buttons appeared to be blurred so that their message was no longer legible.
Hatzenbuhler sent us a guest column and the offending picture, which was also used in a UGA press release covering the event.


 


But this blatant form of censorship leaves the editorial board incredulous — why would UGA bring in hundreds of environmental experts, scientists and students only to blur out the environmental efforts of its own student ambassadors?
Yet this seems to be what happened here, in a moment that was meant to be a step forward in the university's environmental focus.
If the photo has been tampered with, as it seems to have been, we still don't know who did it and for what reason.
But it's sad that this moment had to be marred by such a petty, insignificant act.
And, as an editorial board, we hope that such censorship does not become habit for an institution that prides itself on honor and dignity.
After all, if there truly is no tradition greater, then that should be reflected in the administration's attitudes, especially with regard to the danger of embracing censorship.
The necessity to embrace dialogue, even if that conversation is disagreeable to UGA's official stance, should rise above all else.

The Bulldogs signed defensive tackle Toby Johnson from Hutchinson (Kan.) Community College on Tuesday.
The 6-foot-4, 310-pound lineman was regarded as the No. 1 junior college prospect in the country after spending the past two seasons at Hutchinson. Johnson played his high school ball at Banneker High School in College Park.


 


Johnson told the Athens-Banner Herald that Georgia recruited him to play defensive end, and that he chose the Bulldogs over Auburn, Mississippi State and Oklahoma.
“I can be a player to come in and play right away,” Johnson said. “A player that can cause havoc on the quarterback and just play behind the line of scrimmage.”
He suffered a season-ending knee injury in November, forcing him to get reconstructive surgery to repair his ACL and MCL, but said he expects to be ready once the season begins.
Prior to his injury, Johnson recorded 37 tackles (6.5 for loss), three sacks and 12 quarterback hurries in his second year at Hutchinson.
""We are thrilled that Toby has decided to become a Georgia Bulldog,"" Richt said.

20-Feb-13,SGA committees still at work to complete initiatives,"As the year is beginning to come to a close, the Student Government Association is still hoping to complete several of their initiatives before the end of the academic school year.
Several SGA committees attended the SGA meeting to coordinate and discuss updates on their initiatives for the University of Georgia campus.
The campus life committee is focusing on making Milledge Avenue a safer place for pedestrians.


 


“We’re trying to address the issue of there not being a crosswalk on Milledge,” said Adam Lessner, a freshman finance major from Johns Creek. “There have been so many people hit. We’ve been trying to contact people in Athens-Clarke Co. in the Public Transportation Department, but they have not been receptive to our calls.”
The environmental affairs committee is also in the process of contacting different groups to help them accomplish one of their initiatives for the year.
Jacob Spaulding, a sophomore environmental economics major from Blairsville, said the committee’s first step is to meet with UGA architects and discuss the plausibility of this project. He said once they have clearance from the architects, they can begin to ask support from the student organizations in Terry College of Business.
“We're trying to coordinate with different UGA groups to include renewable energy and increase efficiency standards in the new Terry College building,“ said Spaulding.
Will Burgess, a senior political science major from Woodstock and president of the organization, announced to the SGA general body that only two committee meetings remained scheduled for this year.
According to SGA’s website the public is welcome to attend the meeting as well as ask any questions or express any concerns.

20-Feb-13,SGA now springing into election season,"With spring just around the corner, excitement is building on the University of Georgia’s campus for the Student Government Association’s upcoming elections.
SGA President Will Burgess, a senior political science major from Woodstock, is excited for the potential parties running in this year’s election.
“It’s an incredible but exhausting process,” Burgess said. “Still, it’s a great experience to be involved in — to meet people across the campus and interact with the different groups.”


 


This year’s election process will not be the same exhausting process Burgess remembers. SGA shortened the campaign process from four weeks to two weeks.
Aaron Paul, the SGA Attorney General and Elections Committee Chairman, was involved with the changes made to this year’s process.
“There’s a lot of chaos on campus for two weeks,” said Paul, a senior history and social studies education major from Athens. “People get sick of having flyers and handbills stuck in their faces. We try not to harass the campus and student body as much as possible.”
Paul said the change benefits both the candidates and the student body.
“Last year the campaign process ran for four weeks long, which was extremely long and extremely tiring,” Paul said. “This year we shortened it down to two weeks. So instead of a four-week process, we have a two-week. It’s just such a long process. It’s a hectic couple of weeks.”
Paul said last year parties had two weeks of passive campaigning and two weeks of active campaigning. He said passive campaigning included a presence on social media, while active campaigning meant personally interacting with the UGA campus.
“Instead of having active campaigning and passive campaigning, we just decided to call them campaign week one and campaign week two,” Paul said. “Campaign week one allows the campaigns to only use websites — YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr, Instagram and Pinterest. They can use banners, bulletin board, posters, yard signs, too.”
Paul said anything else that is not specifically listed as permissible in campaign week one should be brought to the election committee’s attention to determine its permissibility.


 


“Campaign week two means they can do everything they do in campaign week one, except they can hand out stuff — handbills, pens, t-shirts — and they can meet with people on campus, they can meet with organizations,” Paul said.
Paul does not know how many people SGA can expect to be running this year, but he said he has a vision of how many parties he would like to see.
“I would like to see the same amount of parties run as last year, which would be four executive tickets,” Paul said. “I would also like to see all of the senate seats contested by at least one challenger.”
SGA’s election calendar is available online, with March 19 as the mark of the beginning of campaign week one. All applications must be turned in by March 20.
According to SGA’s website, candidates interested in running should complete the application available online along with the statement of intent. Candidates must also attend a candidate seminar.
“It’s open to any registered student at the University of Georgia at the Athens campus,” Paul said. “Candidates don’t have to have previous SGA involvement in order to run.”",Kendall Trammell,uganews,https://www.redandblack.com/uganews/organizations/sga-now-springing-into-election-season/article_c1b5b1a6-7b08-11e2-b701-001a4bcf6878.html
21-Feb-13,UGA grad receives fellowship from national sea grant college program,"University of Georgia graduate Carrie Givens will represent the Georgia Sea Grant Program as a recipient of the prestigious Dean John A. Knauss Marine Policy Fellowship. The fellowship is given by the National Sea Grant College Program and is a one year paid program that will allow Givens to work in Washington D.C. with national policy decision makers that regulate marine environments.
“The Knauss scholarship is very much about the opportunity for students to go work in the regulatory environment and see what that’s like,” said Dr. James Hollibaugh, a research professor in the school of marine programs. “So she’s been interested in this as a grad student and getting the Knauss scholarship gave her the opportunity to go to Washington and work with the various agencies that do things in the marine environment and see how she liked it and how she fit in with it.”
The program consists of 30 to 40 participants each year and Hollibaugh considers Givens a qualified recipient of the fellowship.


 


“She was very good, she was enthusiastic, she was interested in the health sciences aspect of the ocean environment, which is why she was in the oceans and human health program here at the University,” he said.
Givens’ research and focus in her field will mainly revolve around invasive species in the U.S. With the fellowship, she will be working with the policies that keep the intruding species out of the waters of the U.S.
“Invasive species are an important part of marine science or any type of science if you’re looking at ecosystem management and conservation because invasive species can come into an environment and change the environment for the native population,” Givens said.
Her time studying at UGA has given her a foundation through her work with other scientists and the tools she needs to present her research.
“I did a very challenging dissertation that required me to work with different federal agencies and collaborations, so I think, you know, knowing how to work with a team and also being able to do research and go through the scientific literature, make decisions, understand the reasons behind those decisions that you have to make,” Givens said.
The Georgia Sea Grant program itself gives students the opportunities to do research and give it back to the city governments of coastal areas. The research that Givens and her fellow grad students did at UGA was used to protect coastal marine fisheries and to learn how to be better prepared for coastal hazards, for a couple of examples.
“We work with coastal communities so that new development has minimal impacts on the environment,” said Charles Hopkinson, a professor in the marine sciences department and the director of the Georgia Sea Grant. “So we get money and that money goes to University scientists and the scientists do research on questions and issues that are problem areas in the coast.”
Givens will have opportunities to land a government job after the fellowship program ends next year since she will have the “inside track,” Hopkinson said. With the credibility of the training that she will receive and the prestige of the program, she could work in departments such as the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service or other offices that sponsor the program.

24-Feb-13,'Everything must go': Vision Video closes after 26 years,"Vision Video employees spent Sunday afternoon tearing displays from the wall and selling what was left of the store’s movie collection, which after 26 years in business had reached about 65,000 titles.
 
Today would be the store’s last.


 



“I actually thought it would bring on quicker than it did,” owner Hank Seward said. “I think there’s a place for [video stores]. But whether or not they’ll survive is another issue.”
The West Broad Street location was emptier than usual as some final customers picked through the empty shelves. “Everything must go” the sign read, and they meant it. New releases: $3.99, DVDs: $1.50, TV shows: $1, movie posters: make an offer. Even an end-table that used to sit by the door sold for $5.
The only consolation: “Well, we lasted longer than Blockbuster,” Seward joked.
Vision Video’s Barnett Shoals Road and Jefferson Road stores will stay open for now, but the same can’t be said for the location that started it all in 1987. It will be the company’s first casualty in an industry that has been limping along since the rise of Internet streaming sites such as Netflix.
“When it opened most people didn’t even have computers, much less Internet,” Seward said with a hint of nostalgia in his voice.
He remembers the days when the store felt like it had its own “club.”
“There were always 50 people in here standing around talking, not even looking at movies,” manager Jeremy Long said. “It felt like you were at a bar, but nobody was drinking. For 10 years, I couldn’t go anywhere. I felt like I was the most famous person in town. ‘Oh my God, hey. I have late movies. Can you return my movies for me?’ It almost drove me underground.”
When the industry started changing, Vision Video stayed afloat with its cult following and an indie vibe that found itself right at home in Athens. The store distinguished itself by carrying the usual new releases, but also filling in Netflix’s gaps with lesser-known titles like documentaries, foreign films and classics.
UGA students comprised most of the Broad Street location’s business, but Seward said they were also the first to make the switch to online.
“[The closing is] surprising because it’s a really good video store, but it’s unsurprising because everyone does Netflix now,” customer Dan Horgan said. “It’s sad but true, video stores just can’t compete with that.”
The remaining Vision Video stores have seen dips in sales, but Seward said it has been less severe since those locations rely less on young customers.
“Hopefully these customers will go to another location and kind of help keep the vibe going,” he said.",JACOB DEMMITT,uganews,https://www.redandblack.com/uganews/athens/everything-must-go-vision-video-closes-after-years/article_09ecacbe-7edc-11e2-8c95-0019bb30f31a.html
24-Feb-13,'Twilight' can't corrupt classic lit,"“What’s in a name?” Shakespeare wrote, “That which we call a rose by any other name would smell as sweet.” Ideally, the same would be said about book covers, but in a world where people do judge books by their covers, it’s simply not true. While I understand the critique outlined by Kayla Quinton in her column regarding the “rebranding” of classic literature with covers that mimic Stephanie Meyer’s Twilight Saga, I fail to see any negative value in the association.
Sure, the decision by HarperCollins’ teen division to redesign covers for classic works by William Shakespeare, Jane Austen and the Brontë sisters was likely a financial one to piggyback off the success of the teen novels. The fact remains the exterior of the book does not change the text within. What it does do is attract a reader’s attention long enough to give the works a second look.
And supposing a reader chooses to purchase Wuthering Heights simply because it’s Edward and Bella’s favorite book, does this motivation make the experience any different? True, these “classics” as we call them do require a bit more “struggle” for a modern reader to understand, but is that an altogether bad thing? They require the same effort in their new hip covers as they would clad in leather backing.


 


The argument that authors such as Shakespeare, Jane Austin and the Brontë sisters shouldn’t be associated with “popular dribble of the day” fails to acknowledge the fact that at one time these authors’ writings were the popular drivel of the day. Shakespeare wasn’t writing for the intelligentsia, he was writing for the masses. His plays were intense and funny and crude and horrifying — they weren’t literature, they were entertainment. Austin published her popular novels under the pseudonym “A Lady,” and each of the Brontë sisters chose to publish under male names to varying levels of success. What, then, about being linked with one of the most widely-read books of the past decade would lead any one of these authors to roll over in their graves?
As an aspiring playwright, I’m inclined to believe each of them would be less concerned with their relationship with Twilight than with the astonishing realization that their work has endured so long. We shouldn’t think of these writers as otherworldly, because they aren’t. It’s the unparalleled genius that we associate with their names that scares readers away from the “classics.” Shakespeare and Austen and each of the Brontës were humans just like us. It’s the human observations in their work that gives them relevance today.
So what makes these Twilight-inspired covers any different from the equally generic artwork these stories have undoubtedly endured in their lifetimes? Their covers are constantly reimagined in hopes of finding new readers. In my mind, if these new book covers introduce even one of Twilight’s largely adolescent readership to the work of William, Jane, Charlotte, Emily or Anne, then they’ve done their job.
And for those avid Twilight readers who set aside their nifty new edition of Pride and Prejudice when they realized they won’t be getting any hot, glittering vampire action, well, at the very least they’ve opened themselves up to a few pages of writing that have outlived generations of readers.
Let’s just hope they understand the greatness that is Harry Potter.

25-Feb-13,"South African educates on reality in Africa with music, speech","A South African DJ will come to Athens to spread good knowledge and good music.
Ntone Edjabe, also known as DJ Ntone, will be playing a set at 40 Watt Club. This is Edjabe’s first time here.
That isn’t his only mission in town. He will also be speaking at the University of Georgia the same day at 4 p.m.


 


As a journalist and a musician, Edjabe has set out to explore more than one aspect of the arts. He has taken up supporting the visual arts and has even started his own Pan-African literary journal, Chimurenga magazine, which features the African student works of poems, short stories and essays relating to culture and politics.
“I work to try to change perspectives that people outside the continent, as well as people on the continent too, that have culture misinformation,” Edjabe said. “I am well aware of this representation that Africans need help generally, and I want to try and show what we do to help ourselves.""
His lecture will focus not only on the highlights of his journal but also correcting some misconceptions, touching on the pressing issue of immigration discrimination in South Africa.
“We don’t need to be in isolation with the rest of the world,” Edjabe said.
Edjabe is an immigrant himself and has personally been affected by this civil crisis. He came to South Africa from Cameroon for schooling. He wishes to inform students not only what is going on in the outside world from a first-person perspective, but to also show how we all connect to each other, just as he does in his work.
Aside from his lecture, Edjabe believes his music can also convey a message.
“It is a lot of music that tries to reach out other places,” Edjabe said. “Music is a different mode, it’s a different medium. It’s less cerebral but there is a certainly a lot of knowledge and very consciously written text in music.”
His music will feature a mixture of, well, everything. From salsa to reggae, jazz, Afro-pop and many others, Edjabe’s goal is to blend as much into one as he possibly can.


 


“Music that tries to move outside of what will be possible because it’s home,” Edjabe said. “I try to find those links in music, just as I do in my writing.”
Edjabe believes growing up in Cameroon, a country with many languages commonly spoken, gave him the cultural inspiration and drive to link everything together in the things that he loves to do.
“One sense of culture, one relationship to the world is very different when you end up in a mono-linguistic part of the world.” Edjabe said. “There really is no such thing as purity because we are too close.”
At the moment Edjabe does not have any albums available as his literary journal is his first and foremost priority, but he does plan to perform occasional shows in Europe in the near future.

28-Feb-13,20 or under: UGA student employees face cut-back on hours,"Students of the University of Georgia have a foothold in the operation of the university. Campus Transit — a majority of its employees being enrolled at UGA — transports students to the dining halls, whose main employment is found through undergraduates. From there, students may head over to the Zell B. Miller Learning Center, yet another student employment oriented entity.
But this system faces possible disruption as a result of new guidelines which may create jobs and opportunities for some students, but at the cost of cutting the weekly hours of other students in a down economy.
Students, who were previously called temporary employees, are now deemed “student employees,” according to a source familiar with the inner structure of Campus Transit.


 


The source has asked to remain anonymous in order to protect their job status.
The number of students eligible to work for UGA will decrease because of new rules governing the employment of students who might not be enrolled in classes, even if they have been enrolled previously during the traditional spring and fall semesters.
“You must be enrolled in and actively attending classes every single semester you work including summer. Your enrollment status must be at least half time (6 hours during fall/semester session),” said an email sent to student employees from UGA Food Services. “This means there is no grace period for working after graduating or withdrawing.”
Many students questioned the motives for the change and wondered why it was made.
Students in areas other than food services — such as campus transit — were also informed of the hour limits, but were still left in the dark
“They just kind of said ‘it’s what the Board of Regents wants,’ so nobody really knows,” an anonymous source said. “Obviously, people higher up know, but they don’t want to tell us. There is still a lot that we are unsure of.”
The Red & Black attempted to contact Ron Hamlin, the University Campus Transit manager, but was unable to reach him as of press time.
Some student employees were not even informed of the changes.


 


“I haven’t heard anything about [new guidelines],” said Katey Black, a junior student employee at the UGA Tate Student Center. “My boss has actually been asking us to pick up more hours.”
Students in almost every major department of UGA’s labor force express doubt about the new limits.
“The limit on hours is really going to hurt a lot of students who have bills and tuition to pay,” said Sarah Warren, a junior student employee at The Village Summit Dining Commons. “I know a lot of people are quitting because they can’t afford to lose those hours. And the changes to summer employment are just ridiculous.”
But these rules concerning hour limits and being enrolled in classes have been in place since 2004, according to the department of Finance and Administration.
“To be a student employee...[you] can work no more than 20 hours a week,” said Toby Graham, the deputy university librarian and director. “There are exceptions to that, but for a basic student employee that’s enrolled full-time, they can work a maximum of 20 hours per week.”
While it may not affect the majority of student workers, those “exceptions” who work more than 20 hours a week face drastic cuts. One student worker said he was expected to cut his hours from 37 hours to 18-and-a-half hours.
Full time adult employees have expressed concern and frustration along with the student workers, even if they won’t be affected by the changes.
While some students have decided to cease being a student employee in search of a better job, others in need of work have decided to take on a second job.


TNCMS.AdManager.render({region: 'fixed-big-ad-bottom-asset', slot: 1, fold: ""below""});


Jeanne Fry, the executive director of food service, said the newly-established guidelines were the most beneficial course of action.
“It will have minimal negative impact because the vast majority of our students work 20 hours or less,” Fry said.
Fry said the “very, very few” students that do work more than 20 hours “will be graduating.” Therefore, the change will have a marginal effect, at most.
“We just picked the University classification that...covered the majority that was easy for us to track and monitor so we are in compliance, and that’s what we went with,” Fry said.
Fry said she was not aware of health care laws which have been purported by some students as the reason for the guidelines.
“We take our direction from the University’s human resources,” Fry said, “and nothing has come down to us [saying] we’re going to have changes in health care and who’s qualified and who needs it.”
With these new guidelines, Fry said the benefits greatly outweigh the penalties.
“This benefits the majority of the students because their tax rate [that gets deducted from their check] is different, and they don’t have to contribute to the GDCP,” Fry said. “The majority of the students are going to be having more money in their check every pay period. Plus, it might provide some other students opportunities to have jobs.”

Michael Floyd, the associate vice president for auxiliary services at UGA, also said jobs were the main cause — not health care.
“Food Services made this management decision in order to create more job opportunities for student employees in the division,” Floyd said.
“The decision was not made in association with any new health care policies. Food Services currently has 450 students who have applied for a job and been added to a waiting list. Less than 15 percent of the students in Food Services will be affected as the average student works 13.6 hours per week. Therefore, the vast majority of our student employees will not experience any negative impact from the change.”
While the number of student employees increases, so does the cost of training new employees.
“Students who worked more than 20 hours a week are typically the ones who have the most experience and know how to do everything,” Warren said. “Now they will have to hire and train a lot of new people, and it will take them longer to gain experience.”
For food service employees, the time required for training employees is about two weeks.
But for students working in campus transit — including the estimated 50 new student employees to be added in June — training requires a minimum of two months of practice. This allows drivers to learn the routes without passengers, earned their commercial driver’s license, follow routes while picking up passengers and eventually graduating from training.
Universities across the country, such as Vanderbilt and Baylor universities, partially follow these guidelines, with students not being able to work more than 20 hours while enrolled in classes.

But over the summer — when students are not enrolled — they may work free of this restriction. Whether or not this rule will change for Campus Transit, as it did for Food Services, is yet to be determined.",Brad Mannion,uganews,https://www.redandblack.com/uganews/campus/or-under-uga-student-employees-face-cut-back-on-hours/article_c7a558a2-815a-11e2-8790-001a4bcf6878.html
4-Mar-13,Sustainable energy infrastructure a winning investment,"There’s been a lot of philosophical and theoretical talk about fossil fuel divestment lately. As an investor, I don’t care for philosophical debates, and I don’t like getting bogged down in abstract concepts. I like money. I like account numbers that get bigger. I like putting my money where my mouth is and winning. It seems fitting, then, that one consider the investment side of the issue.
For those of you who don’t know: the University of Georgia has an endowment of around $550 million. Donors give the University big checks, the checks turn into big numbers in the endowment fund and smart guys and gals at the Board of Trustees use those funds to build an investment portfolio — think hedge funds, stocks, bonds, et cetera. Simply put, the name of the game is to make money.
Taking a quick look at the breakdown of the endowment portfolio, I can make a safe bet that UGA has a decent position in a notorious fossil fuel corporation: Southern Company (SO). To be honest, SO is a great investment: the stock price doesn’t change much, the company has the Southeast on lock and they pay you 4.4 percent a year on your holdings in the form of a dividend.


 


Now let’s say, hypothetically, UGA has $10 million invested in Southern Company common stock. Keeping the stock price constant and reinvesting the dividends, over the course of the next ten years that holding will yield us about 54 percent, or $5.4 million. This is assuming no major stock crash in the next ten years, which, let’s face it, is highly improbable.
The question now is: can we find an alternative investment with a risk level equal to SO stock that can beat the 54 percent return on investment? The magic total to beat here is $15.4 million.
If I were investing my own money, I would reinvest that $10 million in sustainable energy infrastructure on campus. By overhauling old building AC/ventilation systems, replacing old light fixtures with cutting-edge new ones, installing solar thermal water heating units on residence halls and educating the campus about smart energy practices, we can obtain a six-year payback on our initial investment, according to findings from the National Renewable Energy Lab. Returns would come in the form of decreased electricity, natural gas and coal purchases.
At the end of that same ten-year period, we would end up with $16.7 million. In other words, we would outperform the fossil fuel stock by more than $1.2 million with less risky investments.
I urge the University administration, chiefly President Michael Adams, Provost Jere Morehead and Vice President of Finance Tim Burgess, to consider the above scenario. As a land-grant university, we have an obligation to invest morally. As a taxpayer-supported institution, we have the need to be as capital-efficient as possible. As Bulldogs, we have the obligation to invest in ourselves and in each other.
Though it will take considerable political pressure and some clever legal maneuvers, fossil fuel divestment should play an important role in UGA’s brighter future.

5-Mar-13,Malcolm Mitchell dives into charity off field,"Community service is not just a requirement for Malcolm Mitchell — it’s a genuine passion.
On Feb. 16, Georgia wide receiver Malcolm Mitchell visited Emory University and spoke to high school students involved in Usher’s New Look Foundation, which prepares youth for success as service-oriented leaders on a global scale.
Malia Hibbler, a senior marketing major from Decatur, has been involved with New Look since 2005. She arranged for Mitchell to speak during a weekly meeting for the Leadership Academy, knowing he could be an inspiration to the students in the program as well as others around him.


 


“He really takes pride in being someone somebody can look up to,” she said. “He’s changing for good, and I want more people to be like him, so that’s why I got him out there doing all this and speaking to people, because I want this to have an effect on people — his friends and the people who watch him on TV.”
Mitchell revealed details about his past he had never shared publicly and candidly discussed the struggles he experienced. His story emphasized that regardless of their circumstances, if the students worked hard in school, they too could enhance their talents and achieve their dreams.
“I know growing up, that motivation can mean a lot,” Mitchell said. “I took the opportunity to just see if I could be one of those people out there in the world who could motivate kids to do much more than what they were doing.”
Tramel Terry, an early enrollee football recruit from Charleston, S.C., also shared personal stories. He talked about the trouble he got into when he was younger and how he maintained focus in order to gain acceptance into UGA.
The students were energetic after hearing Terry and Mitchell speak and asked plenty of questions. Mitchell’s presence, in particular, was important because he epitomized New Look’s model.
“Malcolm essentially represents our program model of using your talent, education, career and service,” said Vanecia Thompson, a National New Look Mogul in Training and senior journalism major from Lithonia. “I think Malcolm was setting a great example for the younger generation who want to be in his position athletically, but also to know that they need to give back to their community.”
Word spread on social media about Mitchell’s visit with the New Look participants. A video of his speech has more than 2,000 views.
Although this was his first experience speaking up as a role model, Mitchell has participated in community service projects with his teammates and on his own with organizations such as the Boys & Girls Club of Athens.


 


Mitchell intends to continue giving back and empowering youth. In his hometown of Valdosta, he plans to launch a program called STAND, which stands for Start Taking a New Direction, in collaboration with the YMCA.
“In my hometown, the kids have lost, I feel, have lost a lot of motivation, and I think that’s because [of] the lack of role models we have in the community,” Mitchell said.
Mitchell, who enjoys reading, will start a book club through STAND for kids of all ages. He will also continue sharing his story with students across Georgia.
Hibbler gave Mitchell credit for stepping up and becoming more active in the community, but he insisted he could not be successful without the support of his family and friends.
“I did take the initiative to try to step out beyond, I guess, the limits that some people give us as athletes or us as people as far as helping out others,” he said. “But I also do have a great support team as far as Malia [Hibbler], my mom, her mom. I have like two or three really close friends who ride with me the whole way with anything that I’m trying to do.”",Amanda Dixon,variety,https://www.redandblack.com/variety/malcolm-mitchell-dives-into-charity-off-field/article_ae3503dc-850f-11e2-8d01-0019bb30f31a.html
5-Mar-13,Eat To Your Health: Indulge in sweets for sugar high,"One more week until spring break and you’ve done a stellar job at turning away sweets and indulgences — it’s no science, just mere mind over matter.
There’s a huge difference between rewarding yourself with one small, decadent double chocolate chip cookie rather than downing three at the dining hall.
Think quality over quantity. Quality, fresh, homemade baked goods in smaller portions over a spaced amount of time can actually develop more discipline in that the occasional indulgence will become more of treat rather than a trial.


 


Thus began my search for some unique, yummy and portioned sweets around town.
Macaroon:
My personal favorite, and available to gluten-free foodies, macaroons, which come in varieties. Macaroons are made in all sorts of colors and flavors and closely resemble a miniature sandwich.
With almond meal, egg whites and sugar forming the crackers, a complimentary meringue fills the middle for a crunchy, chewy and creamy texture all in one bite.
Thank goodness for Ike & Jane Cafe and Bakery and Lisa Lansing, who specially prepared a dozen lavender macaroons for me. Lansing used the recipe prepared by world famous top chef Thomas Keller of Bouchon Bakery.
“Baking macaroons is tricky and definitely a science. You have to get everything right or else you end up messing them up with the slightest mistake in temperature or measurement. I had to prepare a practice batch yesterday just to make sure I’d get them right,” Lansing said.
You can either pop one of these bad boys freshly after it’s been baked or you can store it in the fridge to allow the flavors to concentrate as well as the texture to harden. Careful while eating these though, crumbs are inevitable.
Mayan Spice Cookie:


 


Head toward downtown Watkinsville and you’ll find this little treasure at Kumquat Mae.
It's a crossbreed of a snickerdoodle and your average chocolate chip cookie, and it's a game changer. With a dry, chewy bite, the Mayan Spice Cookie will leave you guessing as to what its mystery ingredients are.
Though it’s not gluten-free, the dry texture suggests that it has less butter than most cookies and eating just one won’t kill your diet. Also available at Kumquat Mae are gluten-free chocolate chip cookies that taste just as good as the regular ones.
Vanilla Gooey Bar:
Enter into Bee’s Knees Bakery & Gifts with extra caution or you might cave under the tantalizing, sugary aroma. Known for its exquisite cakes, baker Linda Chambers takes a lot of pride in small business and homemade goodies that give back to the community.
“I only buy locally, meaning I only buy my ingredients from within the area so that the tax dollars stay inside the community. I’m all about the free entrepreneurial spirit,” Chambers said.
Looking at the menu, I went with my gut and ordered a Vanilla Gooey Bar with the crust.
A key ingredient to the gooey bar is cream cheese, which makes for a lot of the gooeyness. This treat is heavily sweetened and creamy, so I suggest breaking it in half first and pairing it with a bottle of water to balance out the sugar.

A crispy, strudel-like top with a creamy inside and a cookie base, this sweet might put you into a sugar coma if eaten in one sitting. If vanilla doesn’t quite satisfy all, these bars come in red velvet and double chocolate.
Shortbread and Double Chocolate Chip Cookie Combo:
Though it might not be known for its sweets, Big City Bread Cafe is no stranger to the science of baking.
If you’re not craving something very sweet, just something that will still hit the spot, try the simple and traditional shortbread cookie.
Unlike the store-bought ones, Big City Bread Cafe’s shortbread cookie practically melts in your mouth while crumbling to perfection. With a dome-like shape and a tad of jelly in the center, it’s the perfect example of quality over quantity.
If you’re still hungry, the double chocolate chip cookie is to die for. These small cookies come moist, semisweet and baked to perfection. With powdered sugar lightly drizzled over its crackled top, I recommend pairing it with a small coffee and/or the shortbread cookie.
All treats mentioned above cost no more than $4 with the exception of the macaroons, which are sometimes baked to sell seasonally, but go for $14 for a dozen when specially ordered.",Sara Delgado,variety,https://www.redandblack.com/variety/eat-to-your-health-indulge-in-sweets-for-sugar-high/article_ee6ea67c-851b-11e2-98fc-0019bb30f31a.html
6-Mar-13,On the Road: Writer's journey to SXSW begins,"Editor's Note: Red & Black music beat writer will travel to Austin, Texas over the next few days to cover the music festival South by Southwest. Look for his musical coverage, including concert reviews and interviews, next week.
March 6, 2013 8:57 a.m.
I am already behind schedule.


 


The plan was to pack everything last night and leave after my 1:20 p.m. photojournalism class. Not a single thing is packed.
Today is the easiest driving portion of my trip. I leave Athens, Ga. for Athens, Ala. — the city in which Philip Rivers played high school football and the city Alabama Shakes [who performed at SXSW last year] call home.
It’s also where I have family. But getting to the Huntsville, Ala. area can be hard when you’re leaving at 3:30 p.m.
First off, you usually have to go through one of three cities to get there: Atlanta, Birmingham, Ala. or Chattanooga, Tenn.
Not bad, except I’d hit Atlanta during rush hour, you can never trust Chattanooga’s roads and I-20 in Alabama is something you want to avoid right now.
Wil Petty travel tip: If you can help it do not take I-20 through Alabama. There is road construction from the Georgia border until Birmingham. Alternate route to Austin: Take I-85 to Montgomery, Ala. and hit I-10 in Mobile, Ala.
Somehow in my trek I have managed to avoid all of those cities, instead opting for a back road that takes me through Cumming, Rome and Fort Payne, Ala.
On country roads and heading west, I almost feel like Jack Kerouac.


 


If you are packing for this year’s festival though, here are the crucial things that you need to have while at SXSW.
1. Swimming gear
I know, it is less than a week into March. Austin, though, is a much warmer city than Athens, but that is to be expected. The thing is, if you are going to SXSW, then you’re going to the parties and those are everything. We’re talking free alcohol, free food, free music all for a RSVP.
What does that have to do with swimming gear? Let’s just say some of the parties have pools, or you might want to take a break from the festival and go to Lake Travis. Either way it’s spring break. You need a swimsuit.
2. Multiple forms of identification
Yes, Athens and Austin are a lot alike. In fact they are so alike it is scary for those who visit for the first time. When it comes to underage drinking, not so much, Texas will lock you up for anything.
At many Austin bars, your out-of-state driver’s license won’t do. The last time I went, multiple bars turned me down for only showing one form of identification. Your best bet is to bring your UGACard as well as your license.
3. First aid kit


TNCMS.AdManager.render({region: 'fixed-big-ad-bottom-asset', slot: 1, fold: ""below""});


Not to get all Beaver Cleaver on you, but safety in Austin is pretty important. We’re 1,000 miles away from home and at a festival. Yes, there will be safety areas at SXSW, but if you have your own, you can fix the problem fast and if the injury is serious it can buy you some time.
They sell first aid kits everywhere. The one I bought was $10 at Kroger and has everything from alcohol swabs and band aids to eye patches.
4. Shorts
I hate wearing shorts. You have no idea how much I hate wearing shorts.
But once again Austin is warmer than Athens. You’re looking at a 10-20 degree difference in temperatures this time of the year, usually. Believe it or not, Austin can also be more humid than Athens. The humidity combined with being at a festival surrounded by thousands of people can be uncomfortable in jeans or pants.
I’m not saying to pack shorts exclusively, but I would bring at least one pair.
5. Shampoo/towels
Finally, never, ever go anywhere when you are traveling without your own shampoo, or your own towels. You never know what situation you are getting into when you stop off the interstate for a night in a hotel.

Most hotels usually will have some kind of soap, shampoo and will provide you towels. I've had the pleasure of being at hotels that didn't though. When I finally got the towels, I did notice how disgusting they were, because they had been used so many times.
Really this is a sanitary issue. Even if you don’t use your towels, I would definitely bring them in case of a dirty mattress. My point is, don’t expect the best out of hotel rooms.
Until tonight.",Wil Petty,variety,https://www.redandblack.com/variety/on-the-road-writer-s-journey-to-sxsw-begins/article_ff863b20-8672-11e2-862f-0019bb30f31a.html
7-Mar-13,Athens Slingshot celebrates multitude of arts with technology,"The ultimate combination — music, art and technology — is in Athens Slingshot.
Saturday, March 9, Athens Slingshot will take over three blocks of downtown Athens for a full day of festivities that will center around technology and related connections in art and music for the first time.
In collaboration with the University of Georgia, directors Kai Riedl, musician, and Eric Marty, composer and sound artist, will be hosting the event.


 


The festival will occupy most of the west end of downtown, starting at Prince Avenue and continuing to West Washington Street. Local clubs and bars such as New Earth Music Hall, 40 Watt Club and Farm 225 have been more than eager to support the event and act as a medium to harbor the art and concerts that will be held throughout the day.
Riedl, a graduate research assistant for Ideas for Creative Exploration, met Marty while he was taking one of his classes for interactive art.
“There’s been a lot of us who’s been in town for a while that wanted to create a national, an international intersection for creative enterprise,” Riedl said. “We want to create a platform where UGA, music, art and technology can interface and we believe Athens is an ideal environment to do that.”
The festival will begin with “Tech Shots,” a panel that will allow the digital media minds from respected universities such as New York University, Georgia Institute of Technology and University of Denver. A recommended part of these series is one that will feature locative media called “Darkness Map,” which will give participants a chance to create an app in real time by building a map of Athens displaying the light levels in town.
“We’re trying to harmonize music, innovative art and technology that’s going on here in Athens,” Riedl said.
Like most colleges, UGA is tech, music, and art savvy. Riedl and Marty have been here long enough to observe three of the things that Athenians held dear and seek a fun connection between all three.
Musicians from all over the nation and artists from all over the world will occupy various spaces in the Slingshot buildings. Marty, who has been the art curator for the event has managed to find artists from more than 20 countries including Germany and France, where he has spent some time as an artist.
“We’re looking for works that pushes boundaries in some sense or another,” Marty said.


 


To name a couple, Conor McGarrigle of Ireland who specializes in digital and media art and Alessandro Perini, an Italian who will be coming from Sweden will present a sculptural installation with choreographed lighting.
Athens Slingshot will be an opportunity to experience unique approaches to art when merged with technology from an international perspective.
Riedl and Marty would above all highly recommend listening to as many of the bands as possible. The musicians playing are a wide variety such as DJ MK Ultra, Baby Baby and The Suzan, an all-girl band from Japan.
“There are not a lot of events that people put this much thought behind,” Rachel Bailey, head of press relations said. “When you try to create an experience for people in this town, I mean we have a lot of live music, a ton of art and all this stuff, but rarely are there so many people working so hard to make it cohesive.”
Riedl and Marty already have plans for next year’s Slingshot Athens.

10-Mar-13,Alumni brew southern comfort for Athens,"Correction appended.
As it turns out, the easiest way to Athens’ heart is through its liver.
Two University of Georgia alumni handed out free beer on Saturday as they gave a group of locals a sneak peek at what will become a downtown brewery.


 


David Stein and Adam Beauchamp will convert the former Snow Tire building on West Hancock Avenue into the headquarters for Creature Comforts Brewing Co. The startup will release its first beer around August.
“The beer is in its pilot test-batch phase. We’re brewing a lot of beer right now to perfect our recipe,” Stein said. “We’ll be super local-focused for the first many years. We’re going to saturate Athens, then into Atlanta. We want to stay in Georgia for as long as we can.”
The soon-to-be brew masters went to UGA together in 2005, but realized their real passion had little to do with their degrees. Stein was an international affairs and religion major but got his start as a home brewer. He eventually landed a job as head brewer at Twain's Billiards & Tap in Decatur. Beauchamp studied genetics and ecology but ended up working for SweetWater Brewing Company.
“We knew each other professionally in some regard and knew we had complimentary skills and that we really collaborate well,” Beauchamp said. “I’ve been looking for a way to come back here for a long time. I couldn’t be more excited to move into this community and become a part of it.”
The pair teamed up with a third founder to handle the financial side of the business. They plan to make most their money off keg and bottled beer distribution but will also offer tours similar to those at Terrapin Beer Company. For $10, visitors will get a tour of the facility, a souvenir pint glass and about two hours of beer sampling.
“We’re doing our own thing,” Stein said. “I love those guys [at Terrapin], I love their beer. But we’re definitely going for our own unique vibe.”
With a prime downtown location, they hope Creature Comforts will become more than just a place where beer is made.
“We’re definitely going to try to push the envelope and try new things that are going to draw people in,” Beauchamp said. “We want to have a community focus. We want people to gather here, not just to drink beer like a bar, but when you show up here, you know your friends are here. You know the people pouring your beer, you know the guy that’s brewing your beer. It’s going to be a real focal point for this part of town.”


 


They plan to preserve as much of the historic Snow Tire building as possible. The glass storefront will stay, and left-behind mementos will become decorations. Comfortable seating and two bars will also be installed in what used to be the lobby of the tire shop.
“It’s awesome. Times morph things,” said David Lester, who remembers shopping at Snow Tire in '70s. “It’s great that these guys are coming and wanting to save the bones and integrity of the building. They really almost want to pay respect to Snow Tire. I think it’s a great way to repurpose the existing structure and go forward. It’s neat for downtown.”
With the renovation underway, the only thing left is the beer. Creature Comforts will pull influences from European, German and Belgian roots, as well as the American craft brewery movement. They said they’re “throwing off the reins of stylistic guidelines” as they try to answer the most important question: What do we like to drink?
“We’re going to blow you away with hops from time to time, but it’s going to be in a significant beer,” Beauchamp said. “It’s not just going to be 10 handfuls of hops in a two-pound sack. It’s going to be something that is substantial and has balance. That’s what beer is all about at the end of the day. You get the bitter with the sweet or the sour with the sweet. It’s balance. That’s absolutely critical.”

22-Mar-13,"Our Take: New dean, new media tricks for Grady?","The oldest school of journalism in the world may have a chance to teach us something new.
The newly named dean of the Grady School of Journalism and Mass Communication, Charles Davis, is a professor at the University of Missouri School of Journalism. But, even at this historic institution of journalism knowledge, Davis is a facilitator of the Future Initiative for Mizzou Advantage.
Davis has said it is his goal to create well-rounded journalism students — ones who look a little more like computer science majors. He wants to incorporate new media and elements of multimedia into standard teaching at Grady.


 


As Grady students, this sounds uplifting — but we're a little skeptical. We've heard it before.
Anyone pursuing a career in the media has long heard rumors that you're only going to be hired if you know more than journalism. It might be shooting and editing video or audio clips or it might be knowing enough HTML to design your own website, but these little bits of new media knowledge are often what make or break it in today's job climate.
Over the past few years Grady has taken initiative to provide opportunities for its students to learn the intricacies of evolving forms of media in its certificate program at the New Media Institute. Participants learn detailed and practical skills.
The downsides to the classes in the New Media Program are that space is limited and they are extremely specialized.
In another effort to more widely distribute media knowledge to Grady students, in fall semester the school offered weekly workshops to anyone interested.
Each class covered a different topic, which included the basics of photography, video recording and HTML all taught by Grady senior photojournalism lecturer Mark E. Johnson. Unfortunately, these classes were not well-attended. Around five people made it to each one, even after many persistent Grady listserv emails.
After all of these efforts, Grady still hasn't managed to teach us many new tricks.
Now, as Dean Davis enters the picture, we can only hope he has some new ideas.

23-Mar-13,"Minority religious group shows outreach, seeks growth","Adventist Christian Fellowship is a small, little-known group of Seventh-day Adventists on campus, with hopes to grow larger.
Elaine Ngwenya, the president of ACF, said the Christian group focuses on group activities and Bible study. Its goal is to reach out to more University of Georgia students.
“Most of the people in the group are Seventh-day Adventist and we try to get together and have a friendship, as well as know that we are not alone on this campus,” said the senior advertising major from Lithonia.


 


Ngwenya said the group is all about outreach.
“We do outreach and let the students of UGA know that we are here for them if they need someone to speak to. We pass out food and cards at Tate during the semester so people can know more about us,” Ngwenya said. “We also have a weekly Bible study and meet with other ACF chapters across the state.”
She said the group has on-campus church services once a month. The next service is April 20 at 10 a.m.
Chenee Tracey, a freshman Spanish and international affairs major from Lawrenceville, said she likes the company of the people in the ACF group.  
“It’s nice to have a group on campus that shares the same religious beliefs as I do,” Tracey said. “I also like the fact that we get free dinner every Tuesday for Bible study.”
Tracey said she wished the ACF group was bigger than it is.
“We are a minority religious group on campus and I know there are some other Adventists here who we don’t know about yet and may not know about our group as well,” Tracey said.
Krista Williams, the secretary of ACF, said she enjoys the fellowship in the group.


 


“I choose to be an active member in the group and my spiritual life has been better because of it,” said the junior French and international affairs major from Douglasville. “I have been secretary for two years now and participation in the group is pretty low. It’s hard to bring in new people since we don’t have a large group. That’s one thing we are trying to improve with ACF.”
Ngwenya said being Adventist is to be a follower of the Bible and Jesus Christ, as well as trying to live life as close as possible to the rules of the Bible.
“The difference between Adventist and other Christian denominations is our lifestyle. We are more conservative due to the fact that we try to live so close to the Bible and avoid a lot of the worldly things,” Ngwenya said.
Another difference with the Adventist denomination is the time that they worship.
“One of the reasons we are called Seventh-day Adventists is because we go to church on the Sabbath day, which is Saturday and the seventh day of the week,” Ngywenya said. “The Sabbath day is basically a day of rest and one of the Ten Commandments in Exodus 20. God created the heavens and the earth in six days and on the seventh day he rested, and that’s what we do as well. So we have our campus church services on Saturdays at 10 a.m.”
Ngwenya said the group also has socials throughout the year such as going to the corn maze, ice skating and enjoying a good movie together on Saturday nights.
“The friends I have made in ACF understand what I go through and it’s good to know that someone always understands where you’re coming from,” Ngwenya said.",Helena Joseph,uganews,https://www.redandblack.com/uganews/organizations/minority-religious-group-shows-outreach-seeks-growth/article_53388c68-927c-11e2-8729-001a4bcf6878.html
25-Mar-13,Gym Dogs earn No. 1 seed in Oregon State region,"The Georgia gymnastics team is going to Corvallis, Ore. as the No. 1 seed for this year’s NCAA Regional Championships.
“I love going [to Oregon State],” Georgia head coach Danna Durante said. “The crowd is educated, they appreciate great gymnastics and they always are very gracious hosts.”
This year NCAA Regionals will be held at six separate universities — Florida, Oklahoma, Alabama, Oregon State, West Virginia and Ohio State.


 


Joining the Gym Dogs alongside No. 2 seed Oregon State will be No. 3 seed Arkansas, No. 4 seed Boise State, No. 5 seed Arizona State and No. 6 seed California.
“Obviously, going in as the No. 1 seed is a great thing for us,” Durante said. “We’re excited about that. We’ve worked very hard to get to that point. It’s been kind of our focal point for the past several weeks, so we’re glad that we have that behind us.”
At regionals, the top-two teams will qualify to the NCAA National Championships along with the top-two all-around competitors and any event winners not on a qualifying team.
However, it’s not going to be an easy task qualifying to the NCAA National Championships.
“Oregon State is a great team and they’re well coached, as is Arkansas who we’ve seen several times this season,” Durante said. “It’s going to be a good meet all the way around. We need to go in and take care of business just like we have been the last four weeks because it is going to be a good meet with some good teams.”
Like always, the Gym Dogs are unfazed by which teams will be sharing the gym with them during the meet.
“We’ve been saying that all year,” sophomore Sarah Persinger said. “No matter how the regionals go for every other team in the country, we have our mind-set that we’re going to go out to Oregon State, and we are going to get our job done. Then we’re going to go to LA and put out the absolute best meet that we possibly can. We’re training for a national championship — that’s all that’s on our minds.”
Georgia competed with Oregon State last year at the Auburn regional where the Bulldogs finished first ahead of the Beavers, but this year they will be in Oregon State’s home gym instead of a neutral site.


 


“It reminds me a lot of NC State, which we went to just a few weeks ago and had an incredible performance,” Durante said. “It’s kind of the same set-up where the fans are up high and the equipment is down low. It’s a very intimate setting. It’s a great program — well coached, well taken care of — so it’s just the best of everything.”
But junior Kaylan Earls said it doesn’t matter where the team goes as long as it gets the job done.
“We’re ready for anything,” Earls said. “It doesn’t really matter where we go. We’ve seen Oregon State and Arkansas before, so there’s really nothing that we shouldn’t be prepared to do.”
At the competition, the Gym Dogs will start on vault followed by bye, bars, beam, bye and then finishing off on floor.
“I think it’ll be very familiar for us in that respect,” Durante said. “We get to start on vault, which is a great rotation for us, so we’re excited about that.”
Generally at postseason competitions, the judging is more strict, so the Gym Dogs will have to be in peak form if they want to do well.
“It comes down to those landings and those handstands and little execution points to close out regionals,” Earls said. “They get so strict about those little things. It’s really who’s going to be on their game that day.”
Another positive about having to go all the way out to the west coast is that the team will get accustomed to travel before having to do it for NCAAs at UCLA, assuming the team qualifies.


TNCMS.AdManager.render({region: 'fixed-big-ad-bottom-asset', slot: 1, fold: ""below""});


“I think it’s going to be an advantage for us, actually,” Persinger said. “It’s just the mindset that we’re going to have the advantage. We’re going to be able to get used to the time change and get used to being on that side of the country, so when nationals comes, we’re going to already have done that.”
Placement for the top-18 teams in the country follows a certain formula.
The Nos. 1, 12 and 13 teams are grouped together, Nos. 2, 11 and 14 travel to the same site, Nos. 3, 10 and 15 will compete against each other, Nos. 4, 9 and 16 will go to the same location, Nos. 5, 8 and 17 are in the same group, and Nos. 6, 7 and 18 are matched together.
Then the remaining teams ranked No. 19-36 are evenly distributed throughout the six locations geographically.
However, this year the Alabama and Oregon State regionals had to be switched up slightly.
No. 3 Alabama and No. 10 Oregon State were supposed to be paired together, but with both teams hosting a regional championship this year, the NCAA decided to switch Oregon State and Utah so that everything worked out.
This means that No. 3 Alabama will be paired with No. 9 Utah and No. 4 Georgia will be paired with No. 10 Oregon State.
The other regionals played out as follows:

Florida, Minnesota, Auburn, Maryland, Bridgeport and Pittsburgh will compete at Florida.
Oklahoma, Stanford, Penn State, Washington, Iowa and Southern Utah will compete at Oklahoma.
Alabama, Utah, Denver, Kent State, BYU and Iowa State will compete at Alabama.
Michigan, Nebraska, Illinois, Kentucky, West Virginia and North Carolina will compete at West Virginia.
And finally, UCLA, LSU, Arizona, Ohio state, Central Michigan and N.C. State will compete at Ohio State.
The individual competitors at the Oregon State regional who will compete alongside Georgia and the five other teams include Sacramento State’s Kalliah McCartney, Nicole Meiller and Kailey Hansen; UC Davis’ Katie Yamamura, Anna Schumaker and Michelle Ho; San Jose State’s Bekah Gher and Cassandra Harrison; and Alaska Anchorage’s M’rcy Matsunami.

26-Mar-13,Football position breakdown: RB/FBs,"Editor's note: Staff writer Connor Smolensky is going to give a daily breakdown of each position group leading up to Georgia G-Day spring game on April 6.
Returning starters: Todd Gurley (sophomore), Keith Marshall (sophomore), Merritt Hall (redshirt sophomore)
Biggest losses: Alexander Ogletree


 


Returning players: Brandon Harton (senior), Quayvon Hicks (sophomore)
Key additions: J.J. Green, A.J. Turman
One of the most anticipated things for Georgia fans heading into next season will be what the running back tandem of Todd Gurley and Keith Marshall, “Gurshall”, can accomplish in its second year between the hedges. The two backs combined for 2,144 yards and 25 touchdowns in 2012 on 339 carries, and will be running behind the same line from a season ago. Gurley made the most of his freshman season running for 1,385 yards, ranking sixth in school history, as well as recording 17 rushing touchdowns, which is tied for third overall at Georgia. The freshman from Tarboro, N.C. had nine 100-yard rushing games, and joined the beloved Herschel Walker, becoming only the second true freshman to run for more than 1,000 yards. Gurley earned himself nationwide recognition with his impressive numbers and received Associated Press All-SEC First Team, All-SEC Coaches' Second Team and SEC Coaches' All-Freshman honors.
Marshall, who is known as more of a speed back, played in all 14 games, rushing for 759 yards and eight touchdowns behind 117 carries. Marshall’s biggest game came against Tennessee where he totaled 164 yards, while busting out a 75-yard touchdown run. Marshall is known most for his big-play capability and blazing speed, but struggled to fight off defenders, often going down on first contact. With another year to bulk up, “Gurshall” could be one of the best two-back tandems in the nation.
Yet, where would these two be without the man who does all the dirty work— Merritt Hall. Hall appeared in 12 games last season, making six starts, but injured his ankle in the Florida game, forcing him to miss the next two matchups. Following Hall’s injury, Alexander Ogletree took over the reigns for the rest of the season, but hung up his cleats after the season due to medical reasons. Hall will look to pave the way for “Gurshall”, but if an injury were to occur again, Hicks would be the man to step in. Hicks appeared in 12 games last season, mostly on special teams, but is a load of a man, listed at 6-foot-2, 262 pounds.
As far as what is behind Gurley and Marshall in the running back rotation, there’s not much — yet. Harton has not seen much time in his three years at Georgia, collecting just one 100-yard game, and appeared in only four games last season, averaging one carry in each of those. The Bulldogs look to add some depth with early enrollee Green, out of Camden County High School. Green played on both sides of the ball during high school, but has been used as a running back in spring practices. Green is comfortable in this spot as he rushed for 919 yards and 16 total touchdowns in his senior year, earning him the ranking of the No. 50 athlete in the nation by Rivals.com. Green will most likely be battling with incoming recruit, Turman, for the Bulldogs’ third running back spot. The four-star recruit has about four inches and 20 pounds on Green, and ran for 1,245 yards and 15 touchdowns during his senior year as the No. 37 running back in the nation, as ranked by Rivals.com.",CONNOR SMOLENSKY,sports,https://www.redandblack.com/sports/football-position-breakdown-rb-fbs/article_8e7ab7f6-9628-11e2-bcae-0019bb30f31a.html
29-Mar-13,Football notebook: Defensive line adjusting,"Following the SEC Championship game, Georgia defensive line coach Rodney Garner decided to leave the Bulldogs staff after 15 seasons for his alma mater Auburn.
The man chosen to replace him was Chris Wilson, a former Oklahoma linebacker who has been coaching defensive linemen at Illinois State, Army, Colorado, Oklahoma and Mississippi State since 1998.
The transition from Garner to Wilson has not necessarily been the smoothest for those players who had been under Garner for a few years.


 


“My past three years, I’ve been up under coach Garner and I literally tried to perfect the way he was teaching me,” junior defensive end Garrison Smith said. “Now that I have a new coach I’m learning a whole new way of trying to do it so even though I’m a veteran, I’m kind of like a freshman all over again.”
Wilson has the right intentions, however, and it will be more natural to the returning players once it gets closer to game time.
“He’s just simplifying the defense so everybody can learn it at the same pace since it’s just the beginning of spring,” Smith said. “I guess as we go on further, closer to the season, he’ll get more advanced. Right now it’s just real simple and elementary, just go, don’t really think. It’s just simple but because I’ve been so developed and taught by Coach Garner to look for different things, it’s hard for me to do that because when I see certain things, I know certain things are coming so it’s just hard for me to ignore those things now.”
In wake of the transition, Wilson has been understanding of those players who are working on changing things.
“The new coach understands I’ve been under another coach for three years,” Smith said. “He works with me, he talks to me, he doesn’t curse me out. He gets on the younger guys but I like him because he’s working with me and he understands. He’s not going to expect you to just pick it up overnight.”
Wilson’s understanding and charisma has created a great rapport with his players.
“You get something different every day with Coach Wilson,” redshirt sophomore nose tackle Mike Thornton said. “It’s really just comical stuff. He’s very positive. Every day is something, a new joke or a new story that he has to tell. I say this out of love, but he really pushes us. He’s just a cool guy to be around.”
Fights happen, but not a concern for Bulldogs


 


In the heat of the moment, tensions can spill over into pushing and shoving during practice.
“Fights happen every day,” Smith said. “We all fight the offense. We know they’re our teammates but if one of us fights, we’ve all got to fight.”
Center David Andrews and linebackers Josh Dawson and Amarlo Herrera were players Smith identified as being involved in a lot of the extracurricular behavior.
“David Andrews, he tries being a tough guy,” Smith said. “Josh Dawson causes a lot of fights too…and [Amarlo Herrera] too, he beat up the quarterback, we know he’s a hot head. With a black jersey we’re not even supposed to touch [the quarterback].”
Thornton, who deals with Andrews and the rest of the offensive line a lot at the nose tackle position, admitted that he had not had any issues with Andrews but that he was not innocent by any means.
“We’ve never had a scuffle so far but I’m pretty sure I’ve caused him to have scuffles with other people,” Thornton said.
Regardless, Smith stressed that these fights don’t carry into the locker room or disrupt team chemistry.
“It’s funny. Where I come from, I like to fight, fighting is fun for me,” Smith said. “At the same time, at the end of the day I just want everyone to realize, when we go into the locker room, we’re all a family and we’re all laugh about it. We don’t take personal grudges and fights that happen on the field into the locker room. With the high intensity and physicality of this football game, fights are going to happen and that’s just part of the game.”

1-Apr-13,Finding Fashion: New trends of 2013,"The storefronts of Athens have officially been stocked for spring.
On a campus of more than 30,000 students — and seemingly more than 30,000 weather patterns — many different styles, trends and looks are constantly competing for attention. Individuals get their style inspiration from everywhere—magazines, runways, and even bygone decades.
“There’s kind of this dichotomy in the South about wanting to be this sweet Southern belle and wanting to be on-trend,” said Katie Jacobs, owner of Cheeky Peach boutique. “I think there is a little bit of fear, because trends can make you stand out.”


 


Emily Blalock, a lecturer at the department of textiles, merchandising and interiors at the UGA college of family and consumer sciences, echoed Jacobs’ statements.
“Many college students wait and let retailers tell them what’s cool,” Blalock said. “The fashion public typically waits and lets H&M, Forever21, Zara tell them what’s cool.”
Whether it was scary-skinny Kate Moss or Kate Upton bringing curves back, one thing magazines have always been able to dictate is shape and silhouette.
“Women are back. Curves are back,” Blalock said, of this spring’s popular silhouette. “Women want to be women, and I think we want to look curvy in our clothes. Even jackets, shirts, everything is focusing on the waist, trying to get that hourglass.”
While a shape is important, the whole fashion industry — from runways to local boutiques — are most focused on what goes over it.
And though it may sound cliché, this spring is all about color.
The on-trend palette sounds more like something out of a candy store than a New York runway show.
“We’re seeing lots of pastels, lots of florals, and lots of neons,” said Emily Srygley, the store manager of Red Dress Boutique.


 


That’s right—neon isn’t just for highlighters anymore.
“Some of the bright neons that were around last spring, they’re still back,” said Carol White, a sales associate at Heery’s.
For those who might not be comfortable with head-to-toe neon, subtle accents are also an option.
“We have wedges with neon pink embroidering on the sides,” said Kaycee Reed, a sales associate at Encore.
For shoppers who find the '90s-eque hues too intense altogether, a different color scheme is gaining momentum—one that may be more inspired by the freshness of spring than “The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air.”
“We’re going either really, really neon or really pastel. I’m really drawn to pale lavender right now,” Jacobs said.
While black and white is eternally popular, as showcased by Beyoncé on the March cover of Vogue, the same months’ cover of Instyle looked more like an Easter egg than the dramatic fashion statement most are accustomed to seeing.
“The color mint is really good in ready-to-wear, as well as shoes and handbags, and there’s a lot of corals and tangerines and cantaloupes,” White said.

The ubiquitous ads for Gap’s pastel line of skinny jeans are a great place to go for color inspiration, but Gap isn’t the only company giving denim a makeover this spring.
The wardrobe staple is no longer confined to the leash of light wash versus dark wash.
“Printed jeans and colored jeans have been huge recently,” Reed said.
Red Dress Boutique has also recently stocked up on “colored shorts and skinny jeans,” according to Srygley.
Prints will also be popular as the weather warms up, but instead of heavy, geometric patterns, most will be more eco-inspired.
“The floral prints are really what we’ve seen the most of,” Srygley said.
While some may want to confine their usage of prints to one item per ensemble, others say the standard print-plus-neutral convention may soon go the way of the no-white-after-Labor-Day rule.
“I’m really into bright, bold patterns,” Jacobs said. “We’re trying to break people out of the idea that if you wear a print you have to wear a solid.”

Jacobs said maxi-dresses and blazers will also be crowding shelves and closets in the next few months.
“Maxis are across the board one piece you’re going to see on everyone,” she said. “More casual fabrics for blazers instead of the structure blazer is kind of where it’s going.”
And as anyone who lived through the ombré invasion knows, not all fashion is about what goes on your body.
“Red lips have been around for four years and they’re still fashionable,” Blalock said.
Regardless of whether or not you pay attention to trends, from the pleasant pastels and delicate corals of Milledge to the high-waisted shorts and trendy prints on Prince, fashion in Athens is thrillingly diverse.
“Spring in Athens is a fashion show,” Jacobs said

2-Apr-13,Gym Dogs prepare for unfamiliar rotation,"The No. 4 Georgia gymnastics team is within three days of traveling to Corvallis, Ore. to compete at NCAA Regionals for the chance to go to the national championships.
However, there are still a few obstacles — besides the five other competing teams — in the Gym Dogs' way that they have to overcome before they step onto the competition floor Saturday.
This will be the first meet of the postseason that includes byes, which are rotations built into the format of the meet where a team isn’t on an event but in the locker room.


 


“We just insert [the byes] after vault and after beam in practice,” Georgia head coach Danna Durante said. “We’ll come in [the locker room] for even 10 minutes although they typically last longer — more like 20 minutes — but we’ll take a 10 minute break to put grips on and kind of sit around.”
The team first practiced with byes during a practice last week, and many of the athletes were thankful for that opportunity.
“It’s hard at first,” junior Cat Hires said. “It was a bit of a struggle [last week] — more so than we usually have. Just practicing it with the mental breaks just gets you mentally prepared for it because it is different, sitting there waiting and getting cold and then having to go out and be on. It’s definitely different.”
Hires and most of the other Gym Dogs have had to deal with byes before, but for freshman Brittany Rogers, this will be one of her first times.
“It’s hard getting yourself up and going again especially mentally,” Rogers said. “Physically you can run around for a little bit and get warm, but it’s hard to flip your brain around. We’re practicing that again this week. It was a bit of a struggle for me when we first did it last week because I’ve never done it before. I think practice will make perfect, and hopefully it’ll carry to the meet.”
Besides working in bye rotations into practice, Georgia will be having light workouts before it leaves for Oregon on Thursday.
“We’ve done a lot of gymnastics over the last six or seven months, so we feel like they’re prepared,” Durante said. “We’ll just be doing more of simulating the meet. Tomorrow will be an intrasquad day, and Wednesday we’ll just be working on details before we hit the road to go out of town.”
The Gym Dogs will also continue to work on simulating the feel of regionals in their own gym.


 


“We’re focusing on pressured situations like situations as if it were regionals and hitting on the first one and making sure execution is there,” Rogers said. “Because we’re not going to be high on numbers but high on quality not quantity.”
Once practice is complete for the week, the Gym Dogs will have another obstacle to get past with a full day of travel on Thursday.
“We’ve said all along that it’s a three-hour time change and it’s all the way across the country — big deal,” Durante said. “We’re going to do it again in two weeks. If you make it a big deal and you make it hard and you make it challenging, it absolutely is going to be. They’re all coming to the end of the semester, they’ve all got work that they need to do.”
Hires’ strategy is to start pretending she’s on West Coast time even before she steps foot in the Atlanta airport.
“I’m going to start the night before acting like it’s the time that it is in Oregon,” Hires said. “That’ll help me get on the right time zone. It’ll help make it easier to adjust once we get there.”
For Rogers, there will be something extra waiting for her when she gets to the West Coast.
“For me, it’s going to be nice because I’m going to see my family on the other side of it,” Rogers said. “It’s my sister and grandparents’ first meet, but my parents came to the first home meet because they helped move me down here in January.”",ELIZABETH GRIMSLEY,sports,https://www.redandblack.com/sports/gym-dogs-prepare-for-unfamiliar-rotation/article_7796d3b6-9bd3-11e2-8f49-0019bb30f31a.html
2-Apr-13,"Football notebook: Leaders emerging on defense, offensive line continuing to change","With the talent exodus that took place on Georgia’s defense this offseason, one of the biggest questions facing the unit is who will emerge as a leader.
In most cases, it falls on the shoulders of the most experienced and the senior-most players, and this year it has been no different.
Rising senior defensive end Garrison Smith benefits from both of those categories as he earned his third varsity letter last fall.


 


Smith said he’s not the type to get in the faces of his teammates or give that award-winning speech. Instead, he lets his on-field performance do the talking.
“I just try to lead by example,” he said. “That’s what I have been trying to do ever since I started playing football. I don’t like to be a cheerleader or a hype man or a motivational speaker, that’s not really my role. I just try to lead by example and show my play and my effort, and show guys how to do it the right way.”
Whenever he does decide to let his opinion fly, it bears much more weight since he is a man of few words.
“When I finally do have to speak, it’s going to be important and it’s going to be like the law when I do say it because I really don’t talk much,” Smith said. “That’s how I try to put my influence on the team.”
In the heart the defense is where inside linebacker Amarlo Herrera plays, and his role as the signal-caller forces him to be one of the voices that gets heard regularly by his teammates.
Georgia head coach Mark Richt said that he has nailed down that role, but as far as being a complete linebacker, the rising junior still has some work to do.
“Not only do you have to get everybody lined up, but you still have to do your job and do it well to keep a starting position or have that role as a leader, but I like what I’m seeing in regard to that,” Richt said. “He’s still got a ways to go to be a dominant football player. You want your middle backers to be real physical and dominating in the way they go about their business, but he’s still got some work to do in my opinion on that area. As far as knowing what to do and getting people lined up, he’s certainly doing a good job of that.”
Offensive line continuing the spring shuffle


 


Injuries in different spots at different times on Georgia’s offensive line this spring has led to some experimentation according to Richt.
“We’re trying to find who our best five is for next year,” he said. “So we’re rolling ‘em around a little bit more.”
The loss of guard Chris Burnette and tackle Austin Long to injury has opened up opportunities for younger guys like Xzavier Ward and Mark Beard to assert themselves in the lineup.
“It’s just an on-going rotation,” quarterback Aaron Murray said. “We have a lot of depth, and we’re still missing Chris Burnette and Austin Long who’s been playing great. I think we have around eight guys that are going to be able to rotate though camp, and really push each other to compete for those starting five positions.”
Tackle John Theus has returned to practice, but has been spotted getting reps at left tackle after playing on the right side all of last season.
The man who played left tackle last year in Kenarious Gates has played nearly every position on the line at some point, and Murray joked that he had one more position left to try.
“Kenarious I think has played every position but center,” he said. “I told him the other day he should probably start working on that.”
Left guard Dallas Lee and center David Andrews have been the only linemen to remain in the same spot this spring, but Richt thinks the shuffling of the other three spots has translated into a greater daily effort from Beard and Ward.


TNCMS.AdManager.render({region: 'fixed-big-ad-bottom-asset', slot: 1, fold: ""below""});


“What’s happening is we’re beginning to get some of the younger linemen that are beginning to understand more, getting better, and being in a better position to compete,” he said.
Richt open to possibility of J.J. Green as kick returner
Early enrollee J.J. Green has had to become a jack-of-all-trades since arriving in January, and has been getting the majority of his reps at tailback.
“We really weren’t sure how he was going to respond to it, but so far, he’s learned extremely well and he’s competing hard,” Richt said. “He’s got a long way to go, but he’s making some headway. Whether or not that’ll be his final destination, I don’t know. We made this decision based on need, and also based on that we think he can eventually get out of the backfield and become a receiver and do some things there.”
Tailback Kieth Marshall said he’s been most impressed with Green’s ability to hit the gap when nothing else opens up.
“He’s not trying to balance everything or hesitating,” Marshall said. “If it’s not there, he’s hitting the hole and getting everything he can from it, which is one of the things that the coaches teach us. I think he’s done very well.”
During Tuesday G-Day press conference, Richt was said he was open to the idea of Green lending his 5-foot-8, 171-pound frame to special teams as a kick returner.
“We definitely would like to see what he can do as a return man,” he said. “He’s got great change in direction, and got good speed. As a runner, he’s really got a little toughness about him.”

Georgia’s starting quarterback said it wasn’t too difficult to envision that role for the young Bulldog.
“I think he can be real special in the return game,” Murray said. “He’s very quick, fast and I could definitely see him back there catching some kickoffs.”",YOUSEF BAIG,sports,https://www.redandblack.com/sports/football-notebook-leaders-emerging-on-defense-offensive-line-continuing-to/article_8e31af84-9bf0-11e2-a17d-0019bb30f31a.html
2-Apr-13,G-Day countdown: Bulldogs' deepest position?,"Editor's note: In G-Day countdown, football writers Yousef Baig, Connor Smolensky and Cody Pace will be making daily predictions about the 2013-2014 Georgia football team before Saturday's spring scrimmage.
Today's question: What will be Georgia's deepest position in the 2013-2014 football season?
Yousef Baig: Wide receivers


 


It’s pretty obvious that the wide receiver position is going to be the deepest next season.
You take out seniors Tavarres King and Marlon Brown, and you return a complement that’s been as good as any quarterback Aaron Murray has gotten to throw to.
Opposing defenses will get the privilege to the pick their poison. If they want to lock down Malcolm Mitchell — who averaged 44 yards per game last year — then you’ve got to deal with a healthy Michael Bennett in the slot who averaged 69 yards per contest in the five games he played.
If offensive coordinator Mike Bobo is feeling froggy, he might toss four or five wide receiver sets and then defenses either take the risk of sitting back in a zone or playing man-to-man with a possibility that the second-leading end zone target on the team in Chris Conley is matched up with a linebacker or safety. Let’s not forget about Justin-Scott Wesley who has learned how to play every receiver spot during his redshirt season and, in my opinion, going to have a breakout year.
And those are just the first team guys. There’s also Rhett McGowan who has been showered with praise this spring, and Rantavious Wooten whose deceptive size allows him to sneak behind defenses. Throw into the mix some of the newcomers like the freakish Jonathan Rumph who’s coming in with junior college experience under his belt, or the electrifying Uriah LeMay who will join the team in June.
It doesn’t matter where Murray’s progression takes him on passing plays because wherever he goes, he’s got sure hands and speed waiting for a chance to make a play.
Connor Smolensky: Wide receivers
Hands down, no doubt about it, the deepest position on Georgia’s roster next season will be at wide receiver.


 


The Bulldogs return six pass catchers from a year ago that combined for 117 catches, 1,731 yards and 18 touchdowns. Even with the losses of Tavarres King and Marlon Brown the Bulldogs have various receivers that can bust a big play at any moment. Junior Malcolm Mitchell will be the big-play threat for Georgia with his blazing speed, and will return as the Bulldogs’ leading pass catcher (40) and leader in receiving yards (572). Michael Bennett will be coming back off a five-game season due to an ACL tear where he put up 345 yards on 24 catches.
Chris Conley will return leading the team in touchdown receptions (6). Rhett McGowan and Rantavious Wooten played in all 14 games and combined for 337 yards and three touchdowns on 27 grabs. Justin Scott-Wesley came on toward the end of last season and had three catches for 67 yards in the Capital One Bowl against then-No. 16 Nebraska. I know what you’re thinking, is there more? And the answer to that question is absolutely. The Bulldogs also brought in Tramel Terry in their 2012 recruiting class who was a four-star recruit after catching 48 passes for 792 yards and five touchdowns in his senior year, and has enrolled early at Georgia.
Jonathon Rumph already has two years of college experience under his belt after he spent two years at Holmes Community College in Goodman, Miss. Rumph was regarded as the No. 7 JUCO prospect by ESPN.com, and has also enrolled early. On top of these two recruits, Uriah LeMay put up 842 yards and 14 touchdowns on 43 receptions in his senior year. Bulldog Nation should not worry about a lack of production from its receivers, but some of these receivers may be worried about getting a chance to produce with all the talent that Georgia holds. 
Cody Pace: Running backs
It's hard to argue with Georgia's depth at running back. Georgia's everyday backfield features arguably two of the top five running backs in the SEC, Todd Gurley and Keith Marshall, with either one being able to carry the workload if the other were to suffer an injury. Outside of Gurley and Marshall, the Bulldogs have Kyle Karempelis and Brandon Harton who both have over 4 yards per carry in limited action. Behind Karempelis and Harton is recruit A.J. Turman, a four-star recruit who was ranked the No. 22 running back by ESPN.",YOUSEF BAIG & CODY PACE & CONNOR SMOLENSKY,sports,https://www.redandblack.com/sports/g-day-countdown-bulldogs-deepest-position/article_76a8a9e6-9bb2-11e2-90bb-0019bb30f31a.html
3-Apr-13,Committing to marriage heightens maturity,"The saying goes that age is nothing but a number. 
The median age at first marriage in 2012 was 28.6 for men and 26.6 for women, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.
Reasons for marrying in college range from personal volition to religious beliefs.


 


“The reason I wanted to get married was because of my religion. Religiously, it’s better for us to get married,” said Saba Saleh, a second-year pharmacy student from Suwanee and member of the Muslim Student Association.
Saleh, 22, and her husband married seven months ago. Saleh’s sister knew her husband’s sister-in-law, and they began talking to each other after their families met.
Although her parents were involved, Saleh emphasized that she chose to get married on her own.
“It wasn’t fully arranged, it was semi-arranged,” she said. “I played a big role in it. I wanted to get married. My parents wouldn’t force me to get married to anyone that I didn’t want to get married to.”
Zeeshan Rizvi, another member of the Muslim Student Association, said that marriage is an important aspect of all Abrahamic religions, but for Muslims in particular, getting married at a younger age is valued.
“The earlier, the better,” Rizvi, a Ph.D. student in the engineering department from Karachi, Pakistan, said. “Marriage is considered a very beautiful thing in my faith. [It’s] God’s way of keeping a society more clean. If you’re married, you’re more responsible because you have to provide for your spouse, you have to provide for your children.”
Muhammad, the founder of Islam, understood the important link between religion and marriage.
“There’s a saying of the prophet Mohammed,” Rizvi said. “He says that, ‘getting married completes half your religion.’ If you have a good spouse and a righteous religiously good spouse, then he or she will encourage you to do good things and you’ll do the same.”


 


Within the Christian faith, George Carlton, a senior marketing and finance major from Kennesaw, said there could be a significant number of Christian couples at UGA marrying early based on their religious creeds.
“It is kind of in the Bible to reserve some things for marriage and to not date around just to date,” he said.
The religion discourages premarital sexual relations, and Carlton theorized that for some young Christian couples, marrying at an early age permits them to remain in accordance with their belief system.
“It seems like young Christian couples want to hurry up and get married,” he said. “They don’t like to be intimate, I guess, with each other before they’re married, and so a lot of them just want to buckle down and get somebody.”
Although her religion did not directly impact her decision to get married, Tori Blankenship, a senior psychology major from Kennesaw, plans to respect its teachings by living separately from her fiance, Lee Bailey, who will begin attending UGA this fall as a graduate student.
“We’re both Christian, and we don’t want to live together until we’re married,” she said.
Blankenship, 20, has been engaged since December 2011, but she and Bailey won’t tie the knot for at least another two years. They intend to stay engaged until they both finish school and can afford the wedding they want to have on Herty Field.
Even with the wedding being years away, Blankenship and Bailey felt that it was necessary to officially pledge to get married.


TNCMS.AdManager.render({region: 'fixed-big-ad-bottom-asset', slot: 1, fold: ""below""});


“We just wanted to have that commitment to each other, so that’s really all it had to do with,” she said.
Adrionna Carter and her fiance, Ronnie Williams, Jr., got engaged on March 8, but similarly, they have opted to wait until they have their masters degrees and are financially stable before they get married.
“We want to make sure the foundation is straight,” said Carter, a senior human development and family science major from Decatur.
Carter and Williams, both 22, were together for three years before getting engaged. Although their parents thought the engagement was slightly rushed, they wanted to take their relationship to the next level.
“If you find that one person, then, I mean why not get engaged early and just take your time doing everything else?” Carter said. “We felt like it was right, but we understood what our parents were saying.”
Although Carlton, 21, faced some resistance from his grandmother when he proposed to his fiancee, Kala Adams, he too knew he was ready for marriage. The couple, whose wedding is set for Aug. 3, dated for five years and has survived several challenges in college.
“Coming to college was a big transition for us, being on our own,” he said. “I was in a major I didn’t like at the time, science, and she was doing that too, and it was tough and got between us and we fought a lot. At that point in my life, that’d been the hardest thing I had done and if I could get through [that] with her then as things get harder, I’ll be better at handling them.”
Other young Christians at Carlton’s church have gotten married and have even been encouraged by their family members to do so.

“The people I know, at least in my church, they’re fine getting married early and their parents support it, mainly because their parents had done it themselves, gotten married early and had very happy families,” he said.
Beyond religion, culture also affects whether some individuals choose to marry early. In her Pakistani culture, Saleh said that females generally marry by age 21 or 22.
“Culturally, we’re just used to getting married at a younger age, so a lot of the girls of my culture, just feel ready at that point,” she said.
Regardless of their reasons for marrying as young adults, Carter argues that it is someone’s psychological state, rather than their age, that matters most.
“When it comes to getting engaged and married,"" she said, ""it’s more so based off your mentality and maturity versus your age.""",Amanda Dixon,variety,https://www.redandblack.com/variety/committing-to-marriage-heightens-maturity/article_0313c2d2-9b1b-11e2-9d2c-001a4bcf6878.html
3-Apr-13,Track team to build off early season success,"As the Georgia track and field team prepares to compete in the Florida Relays in Gainesville, Fla. this weekend, its early success so far in the outdoor season serves as a slight indicator of how the team will do going forward.
After a long and cold winter, the tone of the outdoor season is finally being set as the team has excelled on both the men’s and women’s sides in the first three meets.
During practice on Tuesday, men’s sprints and hurdles coach Jon Stuart noted how easy it is for certain athletes to stand out early in the season.


 


“With it being this early in the season, the most talented rise faster than others,” Stuart said. “We have a great team across the board. Shaunae Miller is having a great season, and she just won the 400-meter finals in the Carifta Games in the Bahamas this past weekend. Morgan Leleux is in great shape, and the high jumpers are doing well. We’re trying to get everyone to qualify for regionals in Greensboro, N.C.”
Also among the standouts so far is junior and national leader in the 200-meter, Johnathan Smith, who transferred to Georgia from Guilford College this season.
“Johnathan Smith has been a little surprise,” Stuart said. “He’s having a fabulous season. He’s been our bright spot.”
Smith has remained humble throughout the season.
“It’s been a pretty successful season,” Smith said. “I want to finish off strong, and get ready for regionals, then nationals.”
As the season progresses, Stuart mentions the freshman runners’ adjustment to change as a key factor in the improvement of this year’s young team.
“[The main thing we need to work on is] just race experience,” Stuart said. “We have a lot of freshmen on the team that are not used to running hard every weekend. They still have to get used to having no down time, which can wear them down physically and mentally.”
The team also sees areas that it can improve on as the season goes forward.


 


“We need to work on handoffs in relays,” Smith said. “We just need to practice running in meets and get focused for the rest of the season. The Florida Relays is a big meet. How well we do in Florida will determine the rest.”
The team is expecting new additions once spring football is complete.
“The football players that also run track will be joining us after G-Day,” Stuart said. “They’ll definitely give us a boost.
After two top-20 finishes in the indoor season, the Bulldogs are hoping to mirror that success in the outdoor season.
“It’s hard to predict how the season will end, but we have excellent men’s and women’s teams,” Stuart said. “We had top-10 women’s indoor and top-20 men’s. In the outdoor season we hope to reach the top-20, at least. It’s too early to tell, but we’re hoping to keep getting better. We’d definitely like to finish top-5 in the SEC, which is such a tough conference.”
Smith also expressed his optimism about what the remainder of the season will hold.
“The goal is for a lot of us to go to regionals,” Smith said. “Doing well at the SEC [Championships] is most important. I believe we’ll be top three.”
The Bulldogs will travel to Gainesville, Fla. for the Florida Relays April 5-6.

3-Apr-13,Returning players on defense help mentor early enrollees,"Although Georgia’s defensive early enrollees may be in their first semester of college, they’re already learning one of their most difficult subjects.
“We’ve got a sophisticated defense,” senior defensive end Garrison Smith said. “Young guys like Johnathon Taylor, Chris Mayes, John Atkins, they’re kind of like, like right now our defense is calculus for them.”
The defensive scheme is not just foreign to the defensive linemen, but to every new member of the defense.


 


“Ask Reggie Carter and Ryne Rankin about the defense because it’s rocket science for them too,” Smith said. “That’s just part of the game. When you’re a young freshman, they don’t expect you to know everything like a senior would.”
Because of this, guys like Smith have to do their part to help develop the newcomers.
“I’m just trying hard as I can and just bring these young guys up,” Smith said. “It’s like basically addition and subtraction for me, but for them right now it’s like they’re doing rocket science. If y’all would watch some of the film, it would be a funny sight. You’d think we’ve created some type of new defense.”
The Bulldogs’ defense is looking to replace members at every level after losing seven starters to the NFL Draft, meaning the returning players will be charged with helping the young guys when necessary.
In the secondary, Damian Swann is the only returning player who has started a game.
“It’s a communication thing and it’s me being a leader,” Swann said. “I think I have to take charge out there. When guys are kind of confused I have to tell it to them on the fly … We’ve just got to get everybody on the same page so everybody can play fast.”
Part of being the leader in the secondary will mean learning everyone’s assignments, not just his own, Swann said.
“I think if I know more, I can teach more,” Swann said. “Me being here, my third year, I know exactly what to do at all three corners. It wouldn’t hurt me to try and learn safety, strong or free, it doesn’t matter, to try and learn either one of them so I can be more helpful and more beneficial to the guys that are going to be playing with me.”


 


This will be crucial for Swann more than any other veteran because he will likely be playing with at least one freshman, with Tray Matthews having seemingly locked down the free safety spot.
“[Matthews is] hungry. He wants to play,” Swann said. “Aug. 31 in Death Valley, I think he’s going to be one of the guys that’s going to be there. He’s going to be a guy that makes plays for us, he’s fast, and he just has a knack for the ball.”
The struggle learning the defense for Matthews and the other defensive backs comes with the shift from high school to college, which may be steeper in the secondary than at other defensive positions.
“The terminology is crazy and trying to adjust the formation and motion and all that, it’s kind of fast for those guys coming out of high schools that are only running cover three and cover one,” Swann said. “We do so much in this NFL system that it’s crazy, but once they learn that some words mean the same thing and this means the same thing as that. Once they learn the small things, the rest of it’s going to come.”
The most difficult guy for the secondary to replace may be safety Shawn Williams, who became the leader of the defense following his calling out of the defense after the Kentucky game last season.
“I feel like last year with the Shawn situation, it took him to go to the media for guys to really open their eyes and to realize what he was saying,” Swann said. “That’s when the defense turned around.”
Swann believes linebacker Amarlo Herrera will step into that leadership role, especially now that he will also see more playing time this year.
“I feel like Amarlo is a guy that everybody’s going to listen to regardless, and that’s what Shawn was,” Swann said. “I think Amarlo is going to be the emotional leader, he’s going to be a leader period, emotionally, on the field, off the field, that’s just him.”


TNCMS.AdManager.render({region: 'fixed-big-ad-bottom-asset', slot: 1, fold: ""below""});


As far as linebackers are concerned, Herrera will have some help from sophomore Jordan Jenkins, who started six games at outside linebacker for the Bulldogs last season.
The duo of Jenkins and Herrera will have the task of helping replace Jarvis Jones and Alec Ogletree, two likely first round picks in the 2013 NFL draft.
Those voids may not be filled by freshmen, like in the secondary, with Ramik Wilson moving to inside linebacker and Sheldon Dawson having a stellar spring thus far.
However, Carter and Rankin, both freshmen, are developing well with the guidance of veterans like Herrera and Jenkins.
“I notice that Rankin and Reggie, I like to call them tweedle dum and tweedle dee — they’re coming along,” Jenkins said. “I know the struggle of that playbook first hand, during camp I got cussed out during every other play. It’s hard learning it but once you learn it and once you get a grasp of that, everything gets easier from that point on.”
Because the Bulldogs defense is short on veterans and has a large group of defensive recruits, coaching will be crucial in the early development of these players.
“The coaches hold you to a higher standard [as a freshman],” Smith said. “They get on you, but that’s just to make you better. They don’t want you to get complacent with not knowing enough. They want to push you as far as you can so you can learn it.”
One benefit the early enrollees will have over players joining the team in the fall, outside of the extra semester of learning the playbook, is the in-game experience they receive through the scrimmage.

“A lot of guys learn different,” sophomore safety Josh Harvey-Clemons said. “That’s how I learn is doing it rather than just seeing it in a playbook and trying to study it. The scrimmages really help that.”
For the early enrollees, the key will be to study the playbook as much as possible between now and the start of the season. For the guys coming in, it will be a mad rush to learn as much as possible in a short amount of time.
“They better study over these next couple months or they’ll forget it,” Jenkins said. “Come fall it’ll be something new every week so they better learn it quick.”",CODY PACE,sports,https://www.redandblack.com/sports/returning-players-on-defense-help-mentor-early-enrollees/article_7d58f86e-9be8-11e2-be54-0019bb30f31a.html
3-Apr-13,Football position breakdown: DL,"Editor's note: Staff writer Connor Smolensky is going to give a daily breakdown of each position group leading up to Georgia G-Day spring game on April 6.
Returning starters: Garrison Smith (senior)
Key losses: John Jenkins, Kwame Geathers, Abry Jones, Cornelius Washington


 


Returning players: Ray Drew (junior), Sterling Bailey (redshirt sophomore), John Taylor (redshirt freshman)
Key additions: John Atkins, De’Andre Johnson, Chris Mayes
Georgia’s defensive line could be the biggest question mark heading into this season. With the losses of Jenkins, Geathers, Jones and Washington, the Bulldogs will be losing four players who combined for 129 tackles, 3.5 sacks and 42 quarterback hurries from a year ago. Needless to say, some players are going to have to step up. Smith is the only returning starter for Georgia heading into 2013, and will have to be a leader for the line. Smith appeared in 14 games last season, making eight starts, and collected 57 tackles, including two for a loss, as well as one fumble recovery.
Smith has explained that it has been difficult adjusting to new defensive line coach Chris Wilson’s style of teaching after spending three years with former defensive line coach Rodney Garner, who left Georgia to coach at Auburn. Smith remains confident in his ability to learn the system come the fall.
Drew and Bailey will most likely be battling for the other starting end spot opposite of Smith, and have both drawn praise from coaches throughout spring practices. Drew, who was a former five-star recruit, has underperformed in his two years with Georgia. Drew appeared in 13 games last season, gathering 23 tackles and six quarterback pressures, and has his best game of the year against Georgia Tech where he had a career-high eight tackles. In the team’s first scrimmage this spring, Drew sacked the quarterback two times and had one tackle for a loss. Bailey hasn’t really gotten a chance to show his talents thus far at Georgia, as he redshirted his freshman year due to a high-school shoulder injury, and suffered a foot injury during that redshirt year. Bailey appeared in just three games last year, only assisting on one tackle. Coming into this season, Bailey has lost some weight and has drawn praise from teammates, as linebacker Jordan Jenkins told Red & Black reporter Yousef Baig. “ I feel like this is a whole new Sterling I’ve never seen before.”
Georgia will get its first look at Taylor this season, as he redshirted a year ago. Taylor is a big boy, weighing in at 6-foot-4 and 335 pounds, and was highly recruited out of high school. 24/7sports.com rated Taylor as a four-start recruit, the No. 63 ranked prospect in the nation and No. 8 defensive tackle in the country. It will be interesting to see what Taylor brings to the table come the fall.
Atkins will also be fighting for some time at the defensive tackle position, and has enrolled at Georgia early in January. Rivals.com slotted Atkins at a three-star prospect and the No. 40 defensive tackle nationally. Atkins has shown signs of potential during spring practices, but continues to learn the playbook. Johnson will also try to make a case at defensive tackle, and was seen as a three-star prospect and No. 41 prospect in the nation by Rivals.com. Rounding out the new faces will be Mayes, who spent two years at Mississippi Gulf Coast Community College before transferring to Georgia. In his first year Mayes collected 17 tackles, one forced fumble and a fumble recovery, but redshirted his sophomore year. Mayes is garnered as three-star prospect and the No. 111 junior college player nationally.",CONNOR SMOLENSKY,sports,https://www.redandblack.com/sports/football-position-breakdown-dl/article_32c5384c-9be0-11e2-b982-0019bb30f31a.html
4-Apr-13,After Adams: A delicate balance sought between UGA and Athens-Clarke County,"On his first day as president of the University of Georgia, Michael Adams left North Campus and walked to City Hall. He met with then-mayor Gwen O’Looney.
Pat Allen, director of community relations at UGA, said that action was a testament to the importance of UGA’s relationship with Athens-Clarke County to Adams.
“So that to me, you know, that someone at that level would go to that extent on day one, that’s pretty impressive,” he said. “It shows how real of a priority this is to President Adams.”


 


The town and gown relationship isn’t always perfect, though it’s better than it has ever been thanks to Adams, ACC Mayor Nancy Denson said.
But sometimes, Denson said a little disagreement can be a good thing.
“When everything runs perfectly smooth, it’s not really the best environment,” she said. “That tug and pull between different interests makes us arrive at the best interests for everybody, because if you’re just running along smooth and everything’s going great, you don’t look at your processes very closely. But when you’ve got a little bit of a tug between two areas, you’ve got to look and say, ‘Well how can we make it work for both of these groups to the best interest of both of them?’”
Allen said the help of a community is important to UGA.
“So we know that for us to be able to attract the type of students we want to attract these days, and the level of faculty that we need at the university now, we have to have a solid town,” he said. “So I guess we have a self interest in ensuring that we have a vibrant economy in our community, that it’s a safe place, and it’s a place that people will want to come for four years or for 40 years.”
He said UGA also has a responsibility to the state.
“And of course as a state institution we have a commitment to the state of Georgia, including Athens-Clarke County, to bring the resources of the University to bear on the biggest problems in the community,” he said.
Building a relationship


 


Adams has fostered the relationship with the local community on a variety of levels.
“We’ve given them land for the fire station out East,” he told The Red & Black. “We contributed a sizeable amount of money to the new water treatment plant, a.k.a. sewage. We’ve helped on a number of projects. We’ve scaled ridership on the city bus system, where we now pay them, I think it’s 86 cents a rider. We pay them $850,000 a year, which is what’s kept this city bus system alive. We’ve helped in a lot of ways.”
Though Adams has championed a better relationship, he’s spent time recently urging UGA to stick to its core functions due to tough economic times.
“We would like to help in more,” he said. “But there’s just not been that much venture capital over the last three to four years to do anything new. We’ve had to do the best we could to protect core functions. Well, what are core functions? Teaching, research and public service. And probably in that order, if you look at the budget.”
In his State of the University address this year, he said, “some have forgotten that the University of Georgia is a charity, not a donor.”
While he praised the collaboration on “mutually beneficial” projects in the past, he reminded the audience that UGA is “a nonprofit educational institution” whose “resources have been more limited in the past three years than at any other period in my 16 years here.”
Denson and Adams both acknowledged that they encounter Athens residents who bemoan the amount of land UGA owns but doesn’t pay taxes on. Both, coincidentally, used the term “short-sighted” to describe this complaint.
Adams, in his State of the University address, pointed out that comments of this type are “potentially harmful to our state support base.”


TNCMS.AdManager.render({region: 'fixed-big-ad-bottom-asset', slot: 1, fold: ""below""});


“They contribute to a negative feeling in Atlanta, not widely shared by our funding partners, who still believe that sending some $400 million of taxpayer money every year to Athens is a pretty strong level of commitment,” he said.
Denson disagreed on an even more fundamental level.
“It’s important to note that the University wasn’t just plopped in the middle of town. The town and the University grew together. And basically, without the University, Athens would just be a sleepy little village,” she said. “If we didn’t have all those taxes in property taken by the University, there would probably be just raw land sitting there and it would not have much tax value to it.”
Instead of “raw land,” she said having UGA in her city brings a variety of positives — including a more “cosmopolitan” attitude and business growth.
“The University is more of an asset than anything else to the community, but it’s not a uniform asset to every member of the community,” she said.
Allen said this mind-set is another reason for his job.
Pat Allen and Athens
“These comments from Dr. Adams’ State of the University Address underscore my responsibility to communicate regularly with community leaders on issues critical to the University,” he said. “Many persons in the community who are not directly connected to the University are unaware of the budget cuts we’ve taken over previous years. They see a steady enrollment but do not realize we are serving those students with shrinking resources.”

Allen’s job was actually created by Adams in 2003.
“It’s called a liaison, it’s called a lot of things, but my role is to assure that we communicate with local government and community groups on issues and opportunities for us on issues that we might be having,” he said. “As self-serving as it may sound to you, him recognizing that we needed someone focused on this every day, that’s a commitment of the University’s resources to the issue.”
Even before the job was created, Adams committed UGA’s time and resources to working with ACC.
“Since the mid-90s, a group of University administrators and the senior staff for Athens-Clarke County have breakfast once a month, and we talk about those very types of things,” Allen said. “So we look for things, and communicate openly about what projects that each of us have and how me might compliment each other with those.”
Allen described two types of partnerships between ACC and UGA. One, he said, is project-based. When the city or UGA needs help with something, the two come together to make it happen. The other is long-term and issues-based. This type of partnership deals with the broader relationship between the town and UGA.
UGA gave $3.6 million to ACC’s new water treatment plant for odor control in 2011.
“You remember the terrible smell over on East Campus? That impacted the University and our quality of life,” Allen said. “So we recognized first that a lot of the products they processed in that plant comes from campus, so we partnered with them and helped them with some odor-control technology.”
Part of that contract also dedicated UGA resources to helping expand the College Station Road bridge. The bridge expansion will also provide better access to UGA’s Veterinary Medicine Learning Center that will be built beyond it.

UGA also gave the city land for a fire station adjacent to the plot of land designated for the new Veterinary Medicine Learning Center. Allen said these are mutually beneficial exchanges.
Another prominent collaboration between the city and UGA was made over a building built two decades before the Civil War. The Wray-Nicholson House has flipped between UGA, city and private ownership over its long history. The antebellum home traces its roots with UGA back to 1825, when it served as the dining hall. It then returned to private ownership in 1845.
ACC saved the house from demolition in 1994 as part of a $64 million sales tax referendum vote. The house took up $4.4 million of that referendum. The city bought the property for $860,000 and spent the rest of the money to renovate the house and the four smaller buildings nearby.
UGA, with approval from the Board of Regents, bought the house in 2000 for $2.3 million. It is now the home of the UGA Alumni Association.
Working in the community
On a more systemic level, the University has a neighborhood relations roundtable, composed of “of Athens-Clarke County elected officials, Athens-Clarke County staff, neighborhood leaders and University folks,” Allen said.
The committee used to meet regularly to address issues of ACC citizen concern. A neighborhood leader chaired the group. Allen said the chair eventually told the group that the major issues had been addressed. The neighborhood leaders suggested meeting on an as-needed basis.
“To me, that is a very good example of improving town and gown relations,” he said. “We have the group that was formed to fix the problems saying we’ve come so far that we can just meet on-call. And there hasn’t been a meeting in several years.”

Denson and Allen individually lauded the UGA College of Education partnership with ACC schools.
“We’ve really invested our faculty and staff in assisting the Clarke County school system,” Allen said. “And we help them operate what we call professional development schools, every school now has some type of relationship with the University, though at different levels, some have on-site faculty some have more of a consultative relationship.”
This collaboration began in 2007, but Denson said she hopes to see even more done to solidify the partnership.
“It’s something that has begun to happen but I’d like to see it happen to a much larger degree,” she said. “So it’s a great benefit to those student-teachers that are coming in because they’re getting hands-on, real world experience with students, but it’s also expanding the faculty of the school because you’ve got more people working with those students. So that’s a perfect example of how you mutually help each other. I think it’s just as beneficial to the university as it is to the elementary schools.”
Allen also noted UGA’s involvement in Partners for a Prosperous Athens, an organization that broke ground in 2005 to address poverty issues in Athens. The organization was a collaborative effort on the part of UGA, ACC government, the Clarke County School District, the Athens Chamber of Commerce, and various local nonprofits.
“We formed a group called Partners for a Prosperous Athens where we had a major initiative to identify and address poverty issues here and develop strategies to try to deal with that, understanding that the poverty level of this county, being whatever the numbers show now, is just an embarrassment to a county with the flagship institution of the university system located within it” he said.
He said the University’s ability to collaborate is important to ventures like this one.
“We got involved and partnered with these other people,” he said. “We didn’t come in and say we’re the university we can fix this for you, what we said is let’s work together and we’ll bring our resources in terms of facilitators and office space and back-room support to help our community address what we think is the major social problem here.”

PPA spent time and resources fact-finding and adopting an action plan to address poverty in Athens. It then transferred their findings to a nonprofit called OneAthens. This organization has addressed a variety of needs in the community — most recently helping to develop the Athens Health Network.
Sharing responsibility
Adams said working with Athens is only a part of a greater responsibility to the state.
“I get up every morning thinking, ‘OK, how do I serve the state of Georgia?’ I don’t ignore Athens, I love Athens, I live in Athens, I’m going to continue to be in Athens going forward, but my job is a statewide mission,” he said. “So sometimes I have to balance what’s the request from Athens versus what does the whole state need. And that’s not always a perfect answer.”
Denson said there’s a fundamental imbalance, but the right attitude helps maintain a good relationship.
“Of course the University’s core responsibility is educating its students, and our core responsibility is providing for the safety and welfare of everyone here, including the students,” she said. “So when money gets tighter, that gets to be harder for both of us. But I think that we can make that easier to both groups by having an attitude that we are responsible for each other.”
Resolving conflicts
The positive relationship has had its bumps along the way.

A highly publicized scuffle occurred at Sanford Stadium beginning in 1999. The teams weren’t composed of athletes, but rather of administrators — UGA versus ACC.
Before the 1999 football season, UGA workers noticed a brown liquid that looked and smelled like sewage bubbling up from that sacred piece of grass between the hedges and causing patches of grass to die.
UGA brought in the company that installed the field to determine the cause of the problem. That company brought in an environmental consulting firm, which concluded that leaking sewage from an ACC line was the crux of the problem.
The cost of repair to the field, UGA said, could have been in excess of $1 million.
UGA took the report to ACC officials and indicated they may be at fault and liable to pay for repairs to the field. ACC responded by hiring their own consulting firm.
This firm’s report concluded that the smells and liquid could not be sewage due to the depth of the line beneath the field.
A third report concluded that the smells and liquids were indeed sewage, though the leaks weren’t as bad as in the past. It said the death of the grass was due to old age.
UGA and ACC retained lawyers. The threat of a lawsuit was eminent. But Adams and then-mayor Doc Eldridge announced a solution to the problem in April 2000.

The city agreed to remove a discontinued sewer line discovered beneath the field during investigation.
The project cost approximately $40,000. UGA agreed to bear the cost of installing new turf and restoring the field before the 2000 football season began.
The relationship has eased since.
Allen said community relations is about bigger questions than periodic projects.
“It’s not just helping build a bridge or a fire station, but it’s helping to address issues that are more long-term and not project related, and might have a long-term impact to the University and the community,” he said.",Megan Ernst,uganews,https://www.redandblack.com/uganews/after-adams-a-delicate-balance-sought-between-uga-and-athens/article_3f89dec2-9cce-11e2-b709-001a4bcf6878.html
4-Apr-13,UGA President Michael Adams addresses student concerns in Snell-A-Bration,"At his final Open Mic with Mike forum Wednesday night at Snelling Dining Commons, University of Georgia President Michael Adams “Snell-A-Brated” with students.
To ""Snell-A-Brate"" means to eat at Snelling after midnight on any given day. Adams arrived at 11:30 p.m. and stayed until 1 a.m. Thursday.
He opened the floor for questions, which included topics on parking services, energy alternatives and the power of the Student Government Association.


 


A question was raised, asking Adams what he thought about the displacement of campus parking for the anticipated Jason Aldean concert that Adams said will bring in about 74,000 visitors.
Adams said this burden is an opportunity cost to this new prospect.
“It’s one of those things you don’t like to do but you have to do,” Adams said. ”We know it’s an imposition. I don’t like impositions on students, but it’s one of those trade-off issues.”
Adams said he and the administration are open to listening to students’ thoughts on the management of the concert preparations.
“If the imposition is greater than the benefit then we probably won’t do it again,” Adams said.
The topic of UGA’s coal boiler made its way into the discussion again after previously being addressed at last semester’s forum.
A student representing the student organization Beyond Coal said a letter regarding future of on campus coal boiler was dropped off this afternoon for Adams.
“We’ve heard the students on this one,” Adams said. “I am appreciative of the letter, and I’m appreciative of the sentiment which seemed to indicate that we’re all trying to get to the same spot.”


 


Adams said UGA operates on four boilers – three on natural gas and one on coal that is used on a backup mode.
Despite students’ demands for cleaner energy options, Adams said the administration still has restraints keeping it from resolving this issue.
“One of the things that we have to decide, and we’ve not made a decision yet because we don’t have the money which I wish we had to make a decision on how we replace that fourth boiler,” Adams said.
Adams said that this issue will be a tough decision and it may not have a solution at the end of his term.
“What that fourth boiler becomes will be based off of study and that decision frankly will be left up to the next president,” Adams said. 
A student from SGA asked Adams what ways the organized body could undertake more responsibilities on campus.
Being present for 16 different SGA presidencies at UGA, Adams said SGA has made exceptional strides on campus after its disbandment in the ’80s.
“I think I’ve made 16 lifelong friends through that process,” Adams said. “A lot of things I think get done based on relationships. It takes time.”


TNCMS.AdManager.render({region: 'fixed-big-ad-bottom-asset', slot: 1, fold: ""below""});


Adams also said SGA should take pride in its accomplishments so far.
“I think you guys are as influential as they [other student governments] are just about as anywhere,” Adams said. “I think you guys get listened to. If I started making a list of all of things that we changed at UGA because of student input, it’d be a pretty long list.”
Adams said one piece of advice he would like to leave with students is to explore opportunities that they are most passionate about.
“Be straight with people,” Adams said. “Don’t think that what you see in front of you is the only opportunity you’ll ever have.”
Adams also said students should not underestimate their abilities.
“It’s not always the smartest person, but it’s the person people trust,” Adams said. “Do what your momma told you and keep your nose clean.”
Jim Thompson, a sophomore psychology and public relations major from Evans, said this Open Mic with Mike was interesting to him, but he said he wished more discussion could have been devoted to the transition of administration.
“I know there’s a lot of mention about there’s a transition, and President[-Elect] Morehead is really equipped to handle this phase,” Thompson said. “But I guess I wish there had been a few more comments on exactly what we can expect in the next few months - not even with the transition from President Adams to President[-Elect] Morehead but also with the new appointments that have to be made.”

SGA President Elect, Austin Laufersweiler, a junior communication studies and political science major said Adams’ discussion has left him motivated to begin his duties as SGA president next year.
“Jere Morehead will have huge shoes to fill, but I am excited to see what we can accomplish and I’m ready to begin new work with the new president,” Laufersweiler said.",Kendall Trammell,uganews,https://www.redandblack.com/uganews/uga-president-michael-adams-addresses-student-concerns-in-snell-a/article_295512fa-9d39-11e2-bacb-0019bb30f31a.html
4-Apr-13,Football position breakdown: Safeties,"Editor's note: Staff writer Connor Smolensky is going to give a daily breakdown of each position group leading up to Georgia G-Day spring game on April 6.
Returning starters: None
Key losses: Bacarri Rambo, Shawn Williams


 


Returning players: Josh Harvey-Clemons (sophomore), Connor Norman (senior), Marc Deas (redshirt junior), Corey Moore (junior)
Key additions: Tray Matthews, Shaquille Fluker
The losses of Rambo and Williams will definitely hurt the Bulldogs, but I’m not sure it will be that significant. What Georgia will lose in these two former starters is experience, but as far as talent goes, there is plenty of it at the safety position heading into 2013. There was some question as to where Harvey-Clemons would be playing this season, whether at linebacker or safety, but the former five-star recruit has been holding down the safety position in spring practices. Harvey-Clemons is undersized for a linebacker, weighing in at 207 lbs., but has great size for a safety with his 6’5 frame. Harvey-Clemons is expected to start at one of the safety positions this season following a year where he appeared in all 14 games while collecting 14 tackles and one pass break-up. Norman, a former walk-on who earned a scholarship last August, could make a case for the other starting spot after making two starts last season, and appearing in all 14 games. Norman racked up 18 tackles, but also made his presence known on special teams where he was named one of the team’s most valuable players.
As of right now it’s looking like Norman will be battling with freshman Tray Matthews for that starting spot. Matthews enrolled early in Georgia in January and has received the most praise from coaches of any early enrollees. The freshman from Newnan has also drawn praise from his teammates as Georgia quarterback Aaron Murray said on Tuesday.
“I’ve never seen anyone with that type of closing speed,"" Murray said. ""He’s had some hits I’ve never seen before in my life these past couple scrimmages. I thought he killed [Justin] Scott-Wesley the other day, I really thought he was dead.”
Murray explained that it looks like Matthews has a good grasp of the defense, and he could be a real weapon for the Georgia defense this year.
While nothing is set in stone as far as starters go, Deas will look to make a name for himself coming off a year where he played in 14 games, recording three tackles and a blocked punt against Tennessee. Moore will most likely be battling for a back-up spot, but has showed signs of progress, as he was the recipient of Georgia Most Improved Player Award.
The last player in line will be Fluker, who will have to make a case for himself come fall. Fluker has spent the last two seasons at East Mississippi Community College where he recorded 106 tackles and seven interceptions in his junior college days.",CONNOR SMOLENSKY,sports,https://www.redandblack.com/sports/football/football-position-breakdown-safeties/article_0d6b34fe-9c97-11e2-b8a2-0019bb30f31a.html
6-Apr-13,Young defense resilient after opening-drive score on G-Day,"Georgia’s first-team offense opened the the annual G-Day game in an unconventional way on Saturday.
The first play from scrimmage was a pass attempt by wide receiver Rantavious Wooten to tight end Arthur Lynch after a backward pass from quarterback Aaron Murray.
The trick play, though resulting in an incomplete pass, was enough to shake up the defense for the first drive.


 


“Our offense doesn’t normally run that so we didn’t know what to call,” outside linebacker Jordan Jenkins said. “We got messed up on our alignments and it just sort of threw us off. They threw a lot of surprises at us in that first series.”
However, following that drive, the first-team defense dominated the game, inducing four consecutive three-and-outs and no points surrendered in the remainder of the first quarter.
During that span, the defense recorded three sacks and allowed just 15 total yards.
“The defense did a great job adjusting today,” wide receiver Chris Conley said. “They go up against us every day so it’s hard sometimes to get a jump on people you play against so much… They made some plays, they read some things that we were doing and the defense made it rough on us today.”
A lot of the problems the defense had early can be chalked up to youth and inexperience.
“[It was] just a couple miscommunications,” defensive end Garrison Smith said. “Beginning jitters, if that’s what you can call it. Once everyone settled down we played well…everybody just had to get the nervousness out and just continue to play.”
For a lot of the players involved, this was the first time playing in front of a crowd in a Georgia uniform.
“I guess they might have got their heads caught in the lights a little bit,” Jenkins said. “I know that experience is going to prepare them for when they’ve got the whole stadium filled and everybody cheering and all that.”


 


Following that first drive, coaching played a big role in getting the players back in the right frame of mind.
“Coach just told us to settle down, come out the next drive and get a shutout,” strong safety Josh Harvey-Clemons said. “We already knew that once they got in their offense, our defense is confident enough to know that we can stop it.”
In the long run, the early struggle for the defense could benefit the young guys who will see playing time this season.
“I feel like they definitely recognized that they got a good feel for what it was like scrimmaging,” Jenkins said. “They got a little bit of an early taste of what it’s like playing in the SEC. I feel like after that, after they got cooled down, mentally they were ready for whatever the offense was going to bring to them.”
Overall, the team handled the situation well, Harvey-Clemons said.
“Nobody panicked, nobody was arguing or anything,” he said. “We just came to the sideline, talked to coach Grantham, he showed us what we were doing wrong and we went back out and got a stop the next drive.” 
Following the game, head coach Mark Richt was happy with the rebound of his defense.
“That’s the hardest thing about defense, it’s tough to prepare for things you haven’t seen all spring long,” Richt said. “I think a couple of those plays were plays we hadn’t run much, but we executed well. I thought they settled down pretty good for the most part.”


TNCMS.AdManager.render({region: 'fixed-big-ad-bottom-asset', slot: 1, fold: ""below""});


His one problem was with the defense was their handling of the last drive in the first half, which resulted in a 33-second touchdown.
However, he did provide an excuse for the quick score by the first-team offense.
“We don’t spend a lot of time working on the one-minute, two-minute drills in the spring,” Richt said. “We do it a little bit, one scrimmage, but we don’t do it a lot. We do it a lot more in the fall.”
In general, the defense struggled with the fast-paced series, like those that opened and closed the first half. Part of that, according to inside linebacker Amarlo Herrera, is just communication.
“It’s pretty much just calling the plays on time,” Herrera said. “When the offense starts going fast and we’ve got to call plays from the sideline, we sometimes get the signal a little late.”",CODY PACE,sports,https://www.redandblack.com/sports/young-defense-resilient-after-opening-drive-score-on-g-day/article_59c1e22e-9f0f-11e2-98d7-0019bb30f31a.html
6-Apr-13,Hispanic Student Association hosts field day for Relay for Life,"Students can come out and play games while giving back to Relay for Life.
The Hispanic Student Association Freshman Board will have its HSA Field Day on April 7 from 3:30 p.m. to 7 p.m. on Reed Quad.
Isabel Yanes, a freshman mass media major from Acworth, said there will be plenty of fun games at Field Day.


 


“We will have double dutch, soccer and volleyball tournaments, water balloon competitions, tug of war and three-legged races,” Yanes said. “So there will be a lot of activities for the students to do.”
Natalia Montalvo Ayala, a freshman genetics major from Sugar Hill, said all the proceeds raised go to Relay For Life.
“We have been getting food donations and drinks for the event, and the tickets we sell will go towards Relay,” said. “It’s one of our biggest fundraisers this semester.”
Some of the businesses donating food include Chick-fil-A, Barberitos and Jimmy John's Gourmet Sandwiches.
Anita Guevara, a freshman social work major from Cumming, said Relay For Life helps people who are suffering from cancer.
“It cost $5 to play the games and $1.50 for hot dogs and chips,” Guevara said. “We will have a ticket table and students will get a bracelet to play the games.”
Guevara said seeing everyone come together for a good cause is the best part of the day.
“Some people have never had their loved ones deal with cancer but they come out to support the cause, and some have seen their family members struggle with cancer and can come out and help Relay,” Guevara said.


 


Yanes said every year the freshman board tries to give back to the community.
“We know that Relay for Life is big on this campus and we want to help out with that organization also,” Yanes said.
She said the best part about the field day will be all the games the students can play.
“We’ll be filling up over 1,000 water balloons for the water balloon fight, and soccer tournaments are usually pretty big,” Yanes said. “And the tug of war will be enjoyable also because I lot of people haven’t had the chance to play tug of war since middle school.”
Montalvo Ayala said everyone is welcome at the event.
“There will be no Sunday dinners at the dining hall so why not come out to the field day and get some food that goes towards Relay For Life,” Montalvo Ayala said.",Helena Joseph,uganews,https://www.redandblack.com/uganews/organizations/hispanic-student-association-hosts-field-day-for-relay-for-life/article_0a1738e8-9e6d-11e2-b7e9-0019bb30f31a.html
7-Apr-13,Magician Mat LaVore puts audience members in trance,"My hands and arms were stuck together like glue and I couldn’t release them.
Because of that, I found myself in one of six chairs on stage at The World Famous. Mat LaVore was going to be performing hypnosis on five other audience members and myself.
Earlier tricks in the night had been impressive. In a tribute to Harry Houdini, we watched LaVore swallow needles and thread, while regurgitating it into one piece.


 


Other tricks had the Charlotte, N.C. magician picking the correct word out of an old Time magazine and making every combination in a 4x4 “magic square” equal 35 — a random number an audience member told him to use.
Back to the hypnosis, from a countdown to five, I would be in a sleep. You learn quickly it’s a different type of sleep and LaVore expresses that to the audience. It’s more of a daydream, really.
Basic visualizations quickly came into play. He had all of us imagining that we were on the beach in the Caribbean, then in the desert with a dessert. Finally he had us freezing cold, I was shivering worse than how my skinny frame reacts on a windy January morning.
Keep in mind, I’m freezing my ass off in what has been our warmest day in months.
While continuing to be mildly skeptical, LaVore’s hypnosis did a number on me. It’s weird, because you are completely aware of your surroundings; you are aware that you are on stage and the things that are going occurring in your head are nonexistent and false.
That doesn’t stop you from believing it though.
Such as telling me the number seven no longer existed. Yet when I was asked how many days in a week there were I responded with eight, and said I had 11 fingers. I am saying all of this with the utmost conviction, as though it is common sense.
I even remember thinking to myself “Why is the audience laughing at me? What am I doing?”


 


At other points, I no longer had a name. After 24 years of living, LaVore was able to, in 30 seconds, get me to forget the most basic of facts. Another person three seats down was renamed Jenny Camelhumper III.
He believed his name to be true, to the point of disagreeing with his driver’s license. And since the Camelhumpers are a proud family with a legacy, he was upset when the audience laughed.
Effect-wise, it was all temporary. By the time I was off the stage, I knew my name was Wil and “Eight Days a Week” is a song by The Beatles as opposed to fact.
I have no idea how the mind works or what the systematic process is to make that happen to me so easily. There’s me having a “creative” and “open-minded” personality, but I don’t know where that falls in this scenario.
To be honest, I’m just hoping that we do not enter some weird society where conspiracy theorists are actually right and mind control is a reality.
Because truth be told, I’d be the first one out.",Wil Petty,variety,https://www.redandblack.com/variety/magician-mat-lavore-puts-audience-members-in-trance/article_dfd8c28e-9fbd-11e2-9489-0019bb30f31a.html
8-Apr-13,UGA employee reports car stolen by friend,"A UGA employee reported a theft by conversion after a friend took his car to pick someone up from a club and never brought it back.
The victim told police that he was at his friend’s house and let her borrow his car at 12:55 a.m. on Sunday and that she was supposed to be back by 3 a.m. He woke up around 5 a.m., but the driver hadn’t returned. At 10:30 a.m., he was still at his friend’s house when he called police to report the car stolen. Police said that would mean the driver would be arrested and they would have to go to court, but he said “several times” that he wanted his car back. The car is a green 1997 Toyota Camry valued at $2,700.
Two other reported thefts


 


A University of Georgia student reported her that her wallet was stolen downtown and reportedly suspects two men that were following her and her friends.
The victim was downtown at the Pub at Gameday and had her wallet in her friend’s purse. Between midnight and 2 a.m. Sunday, the wallet went missing. The wallet contained an insurance card, two $100 gift cards, her and a friend’s driver’s licenses and her and her friend’s debit cards. Another friend’s driver’s license was also stolen out of the purse. The victims told police that they suspected “two white males that were following them through the night.”
A UGA student reported a theft by taking after his bicycle was stolen from a bike rack at Ramsey Student Center.
The student told police that he parked the bike Friday at 2:40 p.m., and when he came back at 2:52 p.m. the bike was missing. The bike is a black Hyper Havoc with a front mountain bike tire and a smooth back tire. The bike is valued at $130.
Student arrested for driving without a valid license
A University of Georgia student was arrested after getting into a wreck on the corner of Riverbend and College Station roads.
The officer responded to the wreck Friday at 6 p.m. and found that one of the drivers, Jing Hong, 23, only had a learner’s permit and did not have a licensed driver riding with her. She was arrested and charged with failure to maintain lane or improper driving and driving without a valid license, and then taken to Clarke County Jail.
She was unable to be reached for comment by The Red & Black.

10-Apr-13,Gym Dogs back to work after two days rest,"The No. 4 Georgia gymnastics team has less than two weeks left before it heads to Los Angeles for the NCAA National Championships, which is just enough time to iron out the last of the little details before it’s time to perform.
“We finally, in the last however many meets, put it together, and that’s just a great feeling,” freshman Brandie Jay said. “Now we’ve got to focus on our landings because we can make it better and make our score go up.”
At the last meet, the Gym Dogs still left the door open in terms of landing deductions on vault and bars — two events that they were strongest on at the beginning of the season.


 


“[The landings] eluded us still a little bit,” head coach Danna Durante said. “The vaults were better though, which we were excited about. They were bigger; they were better. We’re working on continuing that ‘go big’ mindset, but we’ve also got to get the landings.”
Besides working on details, this week in practice is just about getting back into the swing of things on Wednesday after having two days off to rest.
“That was really nice to kind of let our bodies recover and recover from the travel a little bit,” sophomore Chelsea Davis said. “Today we’re just getting back into it with individual practice. I think it’ll be a little different for everyone today, working back up tot those routines. We’ll get a lot of numbers in this week.”
Next week the team will start to focus on simulating the situations it will be in come time for nationals.
“Next week we’ll simulate the practice day, the intrasquad day,” Durante said. “Tuesday before we leave, we’ll do some touch up and final detail things. It’s more keeping them light, keeping them loose and keeping them sharp. They don’t need a ton of numbers at this time of the year. If they do, we haven’t been doing our job very well.”
One of the things the Gym Dogs will simulate will be starting on a bye, which is different than marching out and getting onto the equipment right away.
“The coaches do a really good job preparing us in practice for what it’s going to be like in competition,” Jay said. “All last week and even the week before, we practiced for the order that we had for regionals. It’s really paid off, and there’s no surprises.”
Davis is excited for the extra time before she goes up to compete.


 


“I’m going to like it, I think, because it takes me probably at least 10 minutes to put my grips on,” Davis said. “So that’s just going to be just enough time for me to get ready.”
Durante said that having a bye at the beginning of the competition just meant that the team would have one less break to deal with in the middle of the meet.
“We’ll march in and then we get to come back and sort of just stay light,” Durante said. “Then as that bye winds down we’ll click in and only have the one between beam and floor to deal with, which is good. We like this rotation. Bars has been a strong event for us all year, so we feel like the idea of being able to start on nice and strong there and being able to keep that momentum going throughout the meet.”
The Gym Dogs will also have the daunting task of qualifying to the Super Six finals for the first time since 2009.
“We really feel good about it,” Durante said. “We’re going in the second seed in that subdivision. The other teams are strong, but when we do our job and keep the consistency and focus that we’ve had the last several weeks, our plan and our intention is to be going on Saturday [for finals].”
They may be the No. 2 seed in the session, but the Gym Dogs know they will have to be at their best.
“The session that we’re in is really good and we feel good about it,” Davis said. “We know we’re going to have to be on the top of our game both days. We’re planning on qualifying.”",ELIZABETH GRIMSLEY,sports,https://www.redandblack.com/sports/gym-dogs-back-to-work-after-two-days-rest/article_8429115e-a202-11e2-a4f2-0019bb30f31a.html
11-Apr-13,Sexual encounters proven to be less prevalent than peers’ perceptions,"Sex is everywhere.
Sex is on our TVs and in our books, it’s all over the Internet, we talk about it at lunch, and we even discuss it in classes. Sex is a part of life, but when and how sex is incorporated into your life as a college student is a personal choice.
With everything that goes on at college, abstinence may seem like an outdated concept, but if you happen to fall in with the 33.5 percent of college students that U Magazine found in its poll are not sexually active, you are most definitely not alone.


 


""Some people think it's weird and they are alone in being abstinent, but they’re not,"" said Danielle Duncan, a third-year marketing major from Pittsburgh, Pa., and public relations director for Sexual Health Helpers at UGA.
Duncan also noted that among those students who have been sexually active, not all of them are right now.
“Some people are having sex once a year, some people are having it once a month, there are people that are having it three times a day,” Duncan said. “It’s something to keep in mind.”
Abstinence is perceived as being uncommon on campus, and while it’s true that the majority of students have had some form of sexual experience, it’s also true that most students think their classmates are a lot busier in the bedroom than they really are. Abstinence doesn’t seem to be considered normal.
“I think there are a lot of people who have been taught abstinence, but not very many that I have encountered who practice it,” Lauren Berry, a fourth-year English major from Morrow, said.
And there are a ton of other students who feel the same way.
“It’s probably not that prominent on campus,” Sarah Leifeld, a first-year biology major from Canton, said. “I haven’t run into that many people that are like gung-ho waiting.”
According to the American College Health Association, on average, other students tend to think female college students have had about two more partners than they actually have had in the last year, and they tend to think male college students have had an average of 1.5 more partners than they have.


 


Britt Lynch, a first-year communications studies major from Monroe, is one of the students on campus abstaining from sex, but even she feels as if she keeps sparse company in her decision.
“I feel like as a whole, UGA is probably not abstinent,” Lynch said. “I know that a lot of my friends have told me, ‘Oh Brittany, it’s very admirable. I can respect you for being abstinent and being willing to wait, but it’s just something I don’t really see myself doing.'”
Lynch doesn't maintain abstinence for herself though.
“I’m abstinent. I’ve made the commitment to stay abstinent until I’m married, and that’s completely because I feel led as a Christian and what Christ calls us to do, like to live pure lives,” she said.
Even though our views on who is actually doing what are skewed, that’s not to say there aren’t those on campus who really do think abstinence is outdated or unnecessary.
“My personal belief is that if you want to love someone, you should share your whole self with them, — sex is part of understanding someone completely,” Berry said.
With more than 30,000 students on campus, there are bound to be some differences in the way people conduct their sex lives or lack thereof.
“Of course, it is a college campus, so there are going to be people who don’t abstain,” Samantha Meyer, a member of the executive board of the Women’s Studies Student Organization and a fourth-year public relations and women’s studies major from Villa Rica, said. “I do know I personally have encountered people who think that’s silly and it’s not something that they do, but then I know people who are waiting until they’re married.”


TNCMS.AdManager.render({region: 'fixed-big-ad-bottom-asset', slot: 1, fold: ""below""});


Some who abstain don't feel as if they're missing out on anything.
“Some people really don’t treat the concept of sex as something that should be protected or something very special,” Lynch said. “It’s not that you’re keeping yourself from someone when you’re dating them, but it's just that you’re really emphasizing the relational part of it, not the physical part of it.”
Further confusion about abstinence is fueled by the fact that it is defined by different people in different ways.
“When we go run programming out in Tate or for a sorority or for a fraternity, we get asked questions all the time about it,” Duncan said.
Duncan said that Katy Janousek, the adviser of SHHUGA and the sexual health coordinator at the University Health Center, gets questions frequently as well.
“People ask things like ‘If I have this specific type of sex, am I still a virgin? What is virginity?’” Duncan said. “These are questions that we are asked all the time, and those all deal with abstinence.”
If nothing else, this curiosity shows that abstinence is on people’s minds.
Abstinence may not be the prevailing choice on campus, but it’s most definitely here. It’s an option, and if it happens to be your choice, you aren’t alone.

15-Apr-13,NCAA Gymnastics Championships Preview: Illinois and Stanford,"Editor's note: Gymnastics beat writer Elizabeth Grimsley will analyze the potential each team in section one of the national championships — the Gym Dogs' section — has of reaching the Super Six finals.
In the words of UCLA head coach Valorie Kondos Field, “This year’s NCAA National Championships is going to be a blood bath.” Realistically, all 12 of the qualifying teams have the potential of making the Super Six finals, and anything can happen on any given night. Although the teams in the second session — Oklahoma, Alabama, UCLA, Michigan, Utah and Arkansas — are considered to be in the more difficult subdivision, it’s not going to be easy for the first session teams — Florida, Georgia, LSU, Minnesota, Stanford and Illinois — either. This will be one of the most exciting national championships in years with so many teams capable of taking the title.
Illinois:


 


The Illini are another one of this year’s Cinderella teams. On any given night, any team can have the meet of its life and win a competition, but this Illinois team is mainly here to have fun. After shocking gymnastics fans at regionals when they knocked Big Ten champion Nebraska out of contention, the Illini booked their ticket to only their third NCAAs since the program started. After making the trip in 2009 and 2011, the Illini are ready to get back to the big show and demonstrate to every fan in the stands that they deserve to be there.
During the season, Illinois was consistently ranked in the top 25 on three of the four events with beam and floor being its best where Illinois sat at No. 13. Since the Illini start on vault and close out their competition on beam and floor, this should bode well and fans should expect a strong finish from the team. Their season-high team score was only a 196.475, so they aren’t expected to challenge for the top spot in the session or even the second or third. However, they have performed well under pressure situations. It will take a lot of mistakes from the other teams for Illinois to advance to finals, but the Illini have shown before that they know how to take advantage of other teams’ downfalls.
Although the team may not have a very good chance of advancing to the Super Six, there are a lot of very talented gymnasts on the Illini squad capable of making it to event finals. Senior Alina Weinstein is No. 11 in the all around and No. 4 on floor where she scored a career-high 9.975 this season on the event. She should most likely make the floor finals if she hits. Weinstein also earned a perfect 10 on vault earlier in the season and has the potential of doing very well on that event should she make the final.
“We are very excited about qualifying for the NCAA Championships at UCLA,” Illinois head coach Kim Landrus said. “Our team looks at this as a great opportunity. The Morgantown regional was very exciting, and to advance to the NCAA National Championships for the third time in school history was an experience that our girls will always remember. In 2009 and 2011 when we made NCAA nationals, it was a remarkable experience for the athletes. Going into NCAA Nationals, we’re not going to change anything because that’s what got us to where we are today.”
Stanford:
Stanford was the shock of the six qualifying teams to finals in 2012. This year, the Cardinal have had to overcome some obstacles to even make it to the big show. The No. 9 Stanford team is better than its ranking and could easily make finals if other teams falter.
Of the 15 gymnasts on their roster this season, 10 of them are underclassmen. A young and inexperienced team could potentially spell downfall for most teams, but this year’s Stanford squad is anything but inexperienced. Sophomores Ivana Hong, Sami Shapiro, Kristina Vaculik and Becky Wing were all elite level gymnasts competing in international competitions around the world. Hong was the alternate to the 2008 US Olympic team, Vaculik represented Canada at the 2012 Games and Wing represented Great Britain in 2008 in Beijing. With experience not a problem, Stanford will need to focus on consistency and hitting perfect routines if they want to outscore Georgia, LSU or Minnesota for one of the top three spots. With Florida pretty much untouchable — at least during prelims — there are still two spots up for grabs, and Stanford will be fighting for one of them. The Cardinal will start on floor, on of their weaker events, and ending on beam, which could potentially be a problem. However, it is the team’s best event, so ending there could pose less of a threat to Stanford than to other teams.
In terms of any Stanford gymnasts making it to event finals, Amanda Spinner is a regular season All-American on beam and was ranked No. 4 on the event during the last week of the season. Hong is also superb on the event, and Ashley Morgan has the potential of making floor finals. Nicole Dayton also boasts a finals-worthy vault but with so many good vaulters in the session, only a perfect stick will send her to finals.


 


“It gets tougher every year to qualify to this meet,” Stanford head coach Kristen Smith said. “It’s a deep and talented field, and it will be a battle for sure. I really enjoyed watching my team over the course of the year really grow. We’ve had some bumps in the road this year, but I guess that’s what’s expected when you have 10 underclassmen. We are definitely looking great. We’re mentally and physically and emotionally peaking at the right time, so we’re very excited about the opportunity.”",ELIZABETH GRIMSLEY,sports,https://www.redandblack.com/sports/ncaa-gymnastics-championships-preview-illinois-and-stanford/article_0aa0a5be-a5cb-11e2-9839-0019bb30f31a.html
16-Apr-13,Band Turf War gains fan in 'Portlandia' cast member,"Turf War isn't pure country, but it still embraces its Southern roots.
Turf War formed in Augusta during the summer of 2008, a creation of lead singer and guitarist John Robinson's solo project of the same name.
The band has described itself as Southern-tinged indie punk rock, but in light of its return to the studio, it has changed how it views itself.


 


""It's really just the roots of rock and roll with a more modern sensibility. It's rock and roll for people that have time to want to take the time enjoy it,"" Robinson said.
The band consists of John Robinson, Cecil Moss, Brian McGrath, Brad Morris and Ian McDonald. Its debut album ""Years of Living Dangerously"" was produced by Ian St. Pe of the Black Lips and released in October 2011. Almost two years later, the band is hard at work in preparing to tour the Southeast this spring and summer with stops that include Athens on April 16, Summerfest in Milwaukee, Wis., and the Hopscotch Music Festival in Raleigh, N.C., to promote its upcoming EP ""The Great Escape.""
Turf War even had an interesting run-in with Fred Armisen, from ""Saturday Night Live"" and ""Portlandia,"" while recording at the Converse Rubber Tracks studio.
""When we were in the studio, Fred Armisen came by and popped his head through the door while we were mixing the EP ,and he asked us to turn the bass up. That was pretty weird,"" Robinson said.
When the band returned to the studio, it overhauled its previous sound by going so far as to change its lineup.
""We have a new lineup now, everyone in the band switched their instruments, so it still sounds similar to the old music but more fresh and a lot tighter,"" Robinson said.
Through that the band has proven it isn't complacent with keeping things the same and is likely to evolve in the future as well.
""I think it would be interesting to work with Steve Albini to produce a song or an EP of ours. I really don't know if he'd be interested in our sound at all, but I'd like to see what he could create with our band,"" Robinson said.

25-Apr-13,"At farewell reception, thanks given to faculty, staff for success","As the University of Georgia Alma Mater echoed through the Tate Student Center Grand Hall, attendees at the farewell reception for University President Michael Adams and his wife, Mary Adams, were eager to share thanks for the couple’s hard work and dedication of the last 16 years.
“I think he was a very good administrator. Of course, not everyone would like what he would say, but that goes for every administration. The most important thing is, ‘Are you doing the right thing for interest of the Georgia community?’” said Casimir Akoh, a food science and technology research professor.
Will Burgess, former SGA president and senior political science major from Woodstock, said Adams has consistently worked for the good of the UGA community.


 


“The proof really is in the numbers,” Burgess said. “The increasing quality of the student body are both measurable and intangible terms, the large growth in research dollars brought in by UGA faculty, the number of the new buildings that have transformed this campus — one of which, the Terry College, will have its groundbreaking on Friday — [and] the unprecedented growth of the University’s endowment.”
But Burgess said Adams’ integrity was the “real” proof of growth at UGA.
“We will be seeing the fruits of [Adams’] labor in years to come,” Burgess said.
Nelson Hilton, chair of the executive committee of the University Council said Adams has been exceptionally supportive in regards to faculty members at UGA.
“As the etymology of the word ‘faculty’ suggests, my colleagues and I are here to facilitate learning,” Hilton said.
Hilton said faculty would not be able to successfully perform their main tasks as facilitators without Adams’ endeavors throughout the years.
“Faculty today require and expect facilities for our facilitation, and, in that, we depend on — more than any are aware — on someone who can make those expected and required facilities appear,” Hilton said.
Jerry Daniel, chair of the Staff Council, said a leader like Adams faces many challenges and choices during his term.


 


“A leader is going to face tough decisions,” Daniel said. “A leader’s job is to make those tough decisions.”
To make a good decision, Daniel said a leader must research all possibilities.
“I feel that Dr. Adams has done a good job in this area,” Daniels said. “He’s always asked for staff input.”
Paraphrasing a common saying by Adams, Daniels said Athens is not the only group which benefits from UGA’s success.
“If UGA does well, then the state of Georgia does well,” Daniels said.
Looking out into the audience filled with familiar faces, Mrs. Adams said she was proud of the accomplishments of UGA.
“What a great, great institution,” Mrs. Adams said. “One day, Mike asked you to step up and give excellence, and you did.”
Mrs. Adams said the success of UGA should not only be accredited to Adams and herself.

26-Apr-13,UGA welcomes first Terry dean candidate,"When it comes to dean candidates for the Terry College of Business at the University of Georgia, Matthew Myers means business.
Myers, associate dean of the Center for Executive Education and Nestlé USA Professor in marketing at the College of Business Administration at the University of Tennessee, visited UGA this Wednesday to meet with campus affiliates and present the intentions he would have for the school if he were chosen as dean.
“Largely we discussed the challenges facing business schools today, including increased competition from other institutions, the need to develop innovative programs, and funding issues,” Myers wrote in an email sent to The Red & Black.


 


Having visited UGA long ago, Myers said he is still captivated by the overall beauty of the campus.
“I came to campus many years ago to visit friends, and remember it as being one of the prettiest campuses I had seen,” Myers wrote.
The people and overall southern hospitality also lends to UGA’s esteemed reputation, Myers wrote.
“It is very clear that people here care tremendously about their university and the pride really shows through. And the hospitality is just extraordinary,” Myers wrote.
Speaking specifically on Terry, Myers expressed his appreciation for both the more than 140 faculty members and student body – with approximately 3,200 undergraduates – as a source of success.
“The Terry College has a reputation for excellent students, and for a faculty that works very hard to provide those students with the best classroom experiences possible,” Myers wrote.
After graduation, the school even receives much support from its alumni.
“In addition, the college has a very supportive alumni base which is very important in today's educational environment,” Myers wrote.


 


Myers said that if he is selected, he hopes to uphold the legacy Robert Sumichrast, dean of Terry, will leave behind.
“Dean Sumichrast and his team have done a terrific job of making the college stronger over the last few years, which makes Terry one of the rising stars in business education today,” Myers wrote. “It would be a real pleasure to work with the college and the University.”",Brad Mannion,uganews,https://www.redandblack.com/uganews/uga-welcomes-first-terry-dean-candidate/article_501ab57e-ae2e-11e2-8f6f-001a4bcf6878.html

Anna Elizabeth Walls
Anna Elizabeth Walls, a freshman pre-journalism major from Johns Creek, passed away on Nov. 15 at the age of 18. Anna was an avid UGA fan who loved her time as a student, attending football games and spending time with her friends in Myers Hall. She suffered from cystic fibrosis, a chronic condition that affected her lungs, but did not let it stop her from soaking up life at the UGA.
“She recognized the difficulties that she had, and she had a dream and she went for it,” said Kaly Royster, a freshman special education major from Stone Mountain and friend of Anna’s since high school. “For me, that was a big moment in my friendship with her. I wanted to emulate that in her because I saw that and I was like, ‘Wow, she is really driven and she has something that she has to overcome and every day she’s able to do it.’” 
In high school, Anna was the senior editor Providence Christian Academy’s award winning yearbook, which inspired her to pursue journalism as a career. She was rarely seen without a camera in hand to capture the unexpected moments between her and her friends. She had aspirations to become an editor of a magazine, or a photographer for National Geographic. 

Anna was known to form fast friendships during her time at UGA and was eager to spend time with other freshmen. 
“She was just always so sweet and so happy and willing to talk to other people,” said Meera Desai, a freshman management major from Johns Creek and one of Anna’s former hallmates. “She always wanted to be with other people and meet other people and get close to everyone, which I thought was really awesome.” 
Desai said that her willingness to get involved led her to offer paper editing help to anyone who saw the sign outside her door. 
Royster remembered Anna for her sense of humor and the joy she was constantly radiating. 
“She knew how to make you laugh,” Royster said. “She knew how to make things light and funny, and those were great qualities of her too.”

30-Apr-13,Oconee Street church members determined to 'keep on keeping on',"When the Oconee Street United Methodist Church went up in flames on the evening of April 15, the fire took down more than just the building. Without a building, the congregation and programs held by the church have been forced to move.
Oconee Street United Methodist Church stood for over a century and has about 100 members. 
Though the building is beyond repair, members of the church are holding together.


 


“We’re trying to be as normal as we can be in our abnormal circumstance. So we’re having our worship services ... Sunday school for our kids, choir practice and those things that you normally associate with church life,” said Reverend Lisa Caine. “We’re doing our best to keep on keeping on.”
Members of the church have been holding services in the indoor basketball court at Young Harris Memorial United Methodist Church.
“We have been so fortunate that Young Harris Church, and some other facilities around as well have offered space to us, really from less than 24 hours Young Harris offered us space at their church, and we really appreciate them,” Caine said. “So we’re just taking it a week at a time right now, but they have been very generous to us.”
Members of the Oconee Street Church and Athens community held a vigil in April to honor the church. 
Caine said that the helpfulness of the community has meant a lot to her and the church. She said the support came from community members, other churches and former members of the church.
“The community has really been overwhelming. I can’t even tell you how many emails and notes and phone calls that I have received, and not only I’ve received but other members of our congregation have received from people,” Caine said. “I talked today to the widow of a former pastor, who was pastor in the 1960s, so it’s just been amazing all the folks who have reached out to us.”
Caine said that the church plans to rebuild on the same property, but that could take up to a year. She also said that she would like to see the church modernize without sacrificing its history.
“I guess what I’d like to have would be the best of the old and the best of the new. The church is 143 years old, and so, parts of the church are very traditional and they have been on that hill for a very long time ... so I’m not too interested in changing the outside,” Caine said. “But of course, we want as many of the new innovations and comforts and facilities as we can fit into that space.”


 


Besides the regular church services, Oconee Street was home to Our Daily Bread, a program by Action Ministries Athens that provides breakfast, lunch and weekend sack lunches seven days a week to Athens’ homeless, hungry and working poor. 
The program has been in town since 1989 and serves more than 60,000 meals a year.
“They have moved that function now over to First Baptist Church. First Baptist was very gracious in offering space,” Caine said. “So, all of the meals — the whole feeding program — will be located at First Baptist for the interim until [the church is] rebuilt.”
Action Ministries Athens could not be reached for comment, but Caine said the church is moving along with its other programs as well.
“All of their other programs are continuing ... not inside the church but in other buildings,” Caine said. “They’re continuing GED classes, computer literacy and financial literacy and individual case management.”
Church trustee Rick Alpaugh said he sees the tragedy as an opportunity to promote closeness among the church members and affiliates of the church.
“They’re in the transition of the recovery where they’re going to rebuild and it’s almost like a new beginning where they are looking into themselves” Alpaugh said. 
He also noted the strength and sense of community among the displaced church members.

“It’s a devastation that they’ve lost their house of worship,” Alpaugh said, “but they have moved to a temporary facility. It is devastating and heart breaking, but they will recover.”",Kelly Whitmire,uganews,https://www.redandblack.com/uganews/athens/oconee-street-church-members-determined-to-keep-on-keeping-on/article_d1665bec-b1b2-11e2-8c2f-0019bb30f31a.html
2-May-13,"UGA Relay for Life brings in success of $237,000","The University of Georgia Relay for Life held its annual event on April 29 and totaled $237,000 in fundraising for the year.  
“It is our night to celebrate a year of fundraising and to have fun with each other and to really honor cancer survivors and remember people,” said Chief Office of UGA’s Relay for Life Katherine Plumblee, a junior health promotions major from Atlanta.
Outside, there were numerous food booths—one was a pancake grill that made pancakes and bacon while others sold Chick-fil-A or baked goods, said Relay for Life Development Director Savannah Grow, a sophomore risk management service major from Marietta. Indoors, many people sold different things like paintings and other crafted items.


 


Different bands played at the event, and cancer survivors told their stories, Plumblee said.
The event had to make some fast changes though— as it was originally scheduled to be at the Intramural Fields but had to move to the Ramsey Student Center due to inclement weather.
“The executive board started to set up at 7 a.m. that Friday,” Grow said. “This year it was really stressful because we didn’t find out from the UGA Athletic Association until around 5 p.m. that we had to move it indoors and it was going to start at 7 p.m. We kind of scrambled the set, but it actually turned out really well.”
Overall, the event turned drew in approximately 1,000 people, Plumblee said.
“It was students, community members, and parents of UGA students, some staff and faculty even were there. It’s a whole array of people,” she said.
Of the $237,000 total, $23,000 came from the event night, Plumblee said. The organizations First Data and the Arnold Foundation each donated $10,000 for the cause.
The sorority Alpha Chi Omega also donated around $35,000 to Relay for Life, which is their national philanthropy, said Alexis Victor, vice president of philanthropy for UGA’s chapter of Alpha Chi Omega.
“[Alpha Chi Omega] has been fundraising all second semester for Relay. We held a basketball tournament called AChiO King of the Court on March 23, and it was for Greek and non-Greek guys to come and play a 3 on 3 basketball tournament, and we sold t-shirts and everything, so that was our big fundraiser for Relay this year,” she said.


 


The sorority also participates in letter writing along with individual fundraising around the year, she said.
“We hosted the Relay event, so all of the AChiOs were required to go. We all just hung out for the night, and we sold food the night of it — like Chick-fil-A and some hot meals — and had a really fun booth and raised some money to help out as well,” Victor said.
The booth had a basketball theme with a “Space Jam” cutout board for pictures and basketball T-shirts for sale, she said. Alpha Chi Omega also worked with Torch Fundraising who created a “Downtown coupon” card which some of the proceeds went to Relay in the sorority's name.
Even with the inclement weather, all three girls agreed that the event turned out really well.
“I think the night went spectacularly, especially since we had to move inside. I couldn’t have imagined a better event even though our plans had to be changed,” Plumblee said. “I think that it worked out in our favor, and everyone enjoyed it.”",Marena Galluccio,uganews,https://www.redandblack.com/uganews/greeklife/uga-relay-for-life-brings-in-success-of/article_ba9a43e0-b1eb-11e2-b522-001a4bcf6878.html

Leo is a professor of mechanical engineering and vice president and executive director of the National Capital Region operations of Virginia Tech. He previously served as associate dean for research and graduate studies at the Virginia Tech College of Engineering.
The appointment was announced by Jere Morehead, senior vice president for academic affairs and provost. The deans of the 17 schools and colleges at UGA report to the provost.


 


“This is a critically important position, not only for the University of Georgia but for the state of Georgia,” said UGA President Michael F. Adams. “The College of Engineering at UGA was established last year to meet the clear need for more Georgia-trained engineers. I am confident that Dr. Leo is the right leader at this time for our engineering program.”
Leo’s appointment is effective July 1.
“Dr. Leo’s experience as an associate dean of one of the nation’s largest and most well-regarded engineering programs makes him well-positioned to lead the UGA College of Engineering,” Morehead said. “His success in growing the research enterprise at Virginia Tech while creating partnerships with government and industry underscores the institution’s land-grant mission of service to the state, and he will play a similar role in enhancing UGA’s research and outreach as a land-grant institution.”
The search committee was chaired by Svein Oie, dean of the College of Pharmacy, and was assisted by the search firm Witt/Kieffer.
As vice president and executive director of the National Capital Region operations of Virginia Tech, Leo integrates and coordinates the activities of Virginia Tech in the greater Washington, D.C. area. From 2007-2011, he served as associate dean for research and graduate studies for the Virginia Tech College of Engineering, which has approximately 8,000 students and whose undergraduate program is ranked 15th in the nation by U.S. News and World Report.
As associate dean, he led Virginia Tech in its collaboration with the University of Virginia and the government of the Commonwealth of Virginia in the founding of the Commonwealth Center for Advanced Manufacturing. The applied research center accelerates the transition of research from the laboratory to commercial use by pooling resources to pursue university research authorized by member companies. The public-private partnership is an important economic development activity in the state and currently has 15 corporate members from five nations.
From 2005-2007 and in conjunction with his position at Virginia Tech, Leo served as a program manager for the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, a unit of the Department of Defense, where he created programs in the field of biologically inspired materials and systems and managed a portfolio of approximately $50 million in interdisciplinary research.
Leo joined the faculty of Virginia Tech in 1998. His research focuses on so-called “smart materials” that respond to external stimuli, and he has served as principal investigator on 50 research grants and contracts with approximately $12 million in extramural funding. He has authored or co-authored more than 200 research publications and recently founded the Biomolecular Materials and Systems Laboratory, which explores how biological materials and signaling processes can be used to develop engineering devices.


 


He is the author of the textbook “Engineering Analysis of Smart Material Systems” (John Wiley and Sons, 2007), which is used at the senior undergraduate and graduate level at several colleges and universities. He created a course on active materials and smart structures that is based on his textbook and continues to be taught at Virginia Tech.
Leo is a Fellow of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers, a recipient of the Virginia Tech Dean’s Award for Excellence in Research and in 2004 was named Outstanding Recent Alumnus of the highly ranked University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign Aerospace Engineering Department.
He earned a master’s degree and a doctoral degree in mechanical and aerospace engineering from the University of Buffalo. He earned his bachelor’s degree in aeronautics and astronautics engineering from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.
“I would like to thank President Adams and Provost Morehead for the unique opportunity to be the first permanent dean of the College of Engineering,” Leo said. “It will be a privilege to lead the development of a new engineering college at a top-ranked public institution, and I look forward to working with the students, staff and faculty to grow the college and build upon the considerable strengths of the University of Georgia.”",UGA News Services,uganews,https://www.redandblack.com/uganews/campus/donald-leo-named-new-dean-of-uga-college-of-engineering/article_e0eea01e-b8b6-11e2-927b-0019bb30f31a.html
11-May-13,Graduates and UGA President Adams say farewell to their school,"Sanford Stadium was nearly half full Friday evening as friends and family gathered to celebrate Commencement for the spring 2013 graduating class. 
With ""Pomp and Circumstance"" being played by the University Symphony Orchestra, approximately 5,255 students eligible for graduation — 4,164 undergraduates and 1,091 graduate students — filed into their seats between the hedges to be recognized one last time by the University of Georgia. 
UGA President Michael Adams congratulated the grads on their accomplishments, detailing to them all of the changes they have seen across the campus in their tenure as bulldogs.  He used this opportunity to bid the student body and the University farewell, telling the crowd that he cherishes his time at UGA, and is sad to say goodbye. 


 


“For my wife and I,” Adams said, “This has been a labor of love for 16 years.” 
He also conferred the 79th honorary doctoral degree in the UGA’s history.  It was presented to Mary Frances Early, the first African American to earn a degree from UGA.  She spoke briefly, thanking UGA and its students. 
“I say to you, class of 2013,” Early said, “I share in your joy tonight.” 
Early, who has served as a music teacher, a planning and development coordinator and an elementary division curriculum specialist throughout her career, was awarded with an Honorary Doctor of Law Degree. 
Senior Vice President for Academic Affairs and Provost Jere Morehead honored 13 First Honor Graduates for maintaining a 4.0 cumulative grade point average throughout their college career. Morehead will assume the position as UGA president after Adams' departure this June. 
United States Senator Saxby Chambliss (R-Ga) delivered the commencement address Friday night, congratulating the graduates and offering them a challenge as they enter the world. 
“The things you have learned here at UGA, and how you build on those experiences, will have a direct impact on America’s national interests, and on our place in this shifting world,” Chambliss told the grads.  “No matter what career you embrace, or how you decide to fit into this changing world, do it with dignity, do it with passion, with a spirit of community and, most of all, do it with excellence.” 
Chambliss is an alumnus of the University of Georgia, first elected to Congress in 1994 as representative of Georgia’s 8th District, and elected to the U.S. Senate in 2002.  As vice chairman of the Senate Selection Committee on Intelligence, he oversees the programs and activities of the country’s intelligence community.  He will retire in 2014, after his term has concluded.


 


Kaitlin Miller spoke as the representative of the graduating class.  From Stone Mountain, Miller graduated as an honors student with degrees in Economics, International Affairs, and Public Relations.  She charged her class with the tasks of accepting life’s challenges, making personal sacrifices for the good of others, and getting out their comfort zones. 
“UGA has been a harbor for us,” Miller said.  “We have been challenged here, built up here, but harbors are easy. 
“We weren’t made to live in harbors,” Miller continued.  “It is time for us to sail the seas.”",Zach Parker,uganews,https://www.redandblack.com/uganews/campus/graduates-and-uga-president-adams-say-farewell-to-their-school/article_4f8c67de-b9f4-11e2-aa65-001a4bcf6878.html
13-May-13,UGA President-elect Morehead announces administrative restructuring,"University of Georgia President-elect Jere Morehead has announced a restructuring of the university’s senior administration that creates a flatter organizational structure designed to maximize the amount of communication between the president and leaders of major campus units.
The realignment, which is effective July 1, increases the number of people who directly report to the president and is consistent with an organizational structure used at many peer and aspirational institutions.
“The purpose of this reorganization is to create more opportunities for information to flow directly to and from the president,” Morehead said. “We have an outstanding leadership team on this campus, and I plan to meet with them on a regular basis so that I can make decisions that reflect their input as well as the input of those who report to them.”


 


Under the reorganization, the university’s sole senior vice president is the senior vice president for academic affairs and provost. The vice presidents for instruction, research, public service and outreach, student affairs, and information technology will continue to report to the provost. The deans of the schools and colleges also will continue to report to the provost.
The positions of vice president for finance and administration (formerly a senior vice presidential position) and vice president for development and alumni relations (formerly senior vice president for external affairs) will report to the president, as will the vice president for government relations and vice president for public affairs.
The president will have a close working relationship with the vice president for research in recognition of the administration’s emphasis on building the research enterprise and Morehead’s role as president and board chair of the UGA Research Foundation. Morehead also will work closely with the vice president for development and alumni relations and the UGA Foundation in preparation for the upcoming capital campaign.
In conjunction with the reorganization, Morehead is developing a schedule of regular meetings with vice presidents and deans as well as with faculty, staff and student representatives.
“In addition to maintaining an active schedule with external constituents related to our upcoming capital campaign, I intend to engage on a regular basis with members of the campus community to ensure that a diversity of voices is heard,” Morehead said. “My goal is to maintain an environment that encourages open communication with the shared goal of enhancing the University of Georgia’s role as one of the nation’s great public universities.”",UGA News Service,uganews,https://www.redandblack.com/uganews/uga-president-elect-morehead-announces-administrative-restructuring/article_6657a118-bbf2-11e2-b00f-0019bb30f31a.html

21-May-13,UGA receives $15 million grant for peanut research,"A $15 million grant from the U.S. Agency on International Development is giving a boost in funds to international peanut research at the University of Georgia.
The USAID grant awarded to the UGA College of Agricultural and Environmental Sciences will go toward management of the Peanut and Mycotoxin Innovation Lab, formerly known as the Peanut Collaborative Research Support Programs, or Peanut CRSP. One of 10 innovation labs in existence, the lab is designed to help provide essential research for impoverished countries where people suffer from malnutrition.
“I think the peanut industry has always had an interest in helping humanitarian situations,” said the grant’s principal investigator Steve Brown, who is the college’s assistant dean for extension. “The University of Georgia and the peanut industry are proud to have this program centered out of the state of Georgia. It means a lot to us.”


 


Brown also will serve as interim director of the Peanut and Mycotoxin Innovation Lab.
The newly funded program will be anchored at UGA and over the next four years will focus the on helping five countries: Haiti, Ghana, Mozambique, Malawi and Zambia. During their time in these countries, UGA researchers and collaborators from other universities and organizations will help local farmers and work to improve the entire peanut value chain from production to product development.
One project already in the works will look at mycotoxins, which are potent toxins produced by fungi and found in several staple food products. Their goal will be to look for ways to eliminate the toxic problem, which can be a major health issue in some developing countries.
Other projects will be selected over the next several weeks.
“The countries we are going to be working in are not and will never be competitors of the U.S. peanut industry,” Brown said. “We’re trying to help them crawl their way out of poverty and, if peanuts can help them do that, then we’re the logical ones to lead the effort.”
Scott Angle, dean and director of the College of Agricultural and Environmental Sciences, said the Peanut and Mycotoxin Innovation Lab’s research also will be applied in Georgia.

25-May-13,UGA faculty awarded innovative instruction grants,"Twenty-six University of Georgia faculty projects designed to improve teaching were recently funded through grants provided by the Office of the Vice President for Instruction, in collaboration with the Office of the Senior Vice President for Academic Affairs and Provost.
Each of the Summer 2013 Innovative Instruction Faculty Grants provides $5,000 for faculty to improve teaching and learning through innovative instructional projects, such as redesign of course curricula and materials, integration of new techniques or pedagogical strategies for a course, or exploration of a new instructional technique.
The projects also focus on faculty improving instruction in high-demand courses (large lecture classes, courses involving multiple sections, general education courses, etc.), as well as those that integrate instructional technology.


 


“This is the second year these instruction grants have been funded to faculty, and once again, the selection process was extremely difficult, due in large part to the overwhelming number of submissions and the overall quality of the proposals,” said Laura Jolly, vice president for instruction.
“This year’s submissions demonstrated further interest in technology to enhance the student learning experience, as well as interests in supporting current campus initiatives. This is strong evidence of the faculty’s commitment to improving teaching and learning and expanding beyond traditional instruction methods.”
Each of the 92 proposals was reviewed by three faculty members outside the college from which the proposals were submitted. The 26 projects, which included 40 faculty across the university, receiving grants were:

30-May-13,UGA research uncovers cost of resiliency in kids,"Children living in poverty who appear to succeed socially may be failing biologically. Students able to overcome the stress of growing up poor are labeled “resilient” because of their ability to overcome adversity, but University of Georgia researchers found this resiliency has health costs that last well into adulthood.“Exposure to stress over time gets under the skin of children and adolescents, which makes them more vulnerable to disease later in life,” said Gene Brody, founder and director of the UGA Center for Family Research.Looking at a sample of 489 African-American youths from working poor families in south Georgia, Brody evaluated the overall poverty-related risks experienced by children annually at ages 11 to 13 as well as teacher-reported competence. Allostatic load, a measure of wear and tear on the body, was taken for each child at age 19. Allostatic load is a measure of stress hormones, blood pressure and body mass index.


 


The results, which were published May 30 in the journal Psychological Science, found kids 11 to 13 who experienced high levels of stress and whose teachers evaluated them as performing well emotionally, academically and socially had a high allostatic load at age 19.“The children who are doing good at school, playing well with friends, have high self-esteem and don’t have behavior problems are often thought of as beating the odds or being resilient in the face of adversity,” said Brody. “We hypothesized maybe at one level they are resilient, but looking at their biology and asking what is the cost, we find a physiologic toll to attaining behavior resilience.”The body adapts to stressful situations through the activation of neural mechanisms, including the release of stress hormones cortisol and epinephrine, which have both protective and damaging effects on the body. Short-term, these hormones are important for adapting to stress, particularly stress associated with financial hardship. When used frequently over time, stress hormones can compromise immune system functions and other bodily systems, potentially speeding up disease processes—meaning that they can end up with chronic diseases at a much younger age.“We used to assume that cardiovascular disease, stroke, diabetes and cancer just happen to people as they get older,” Brody said. “But, we see the success-oriented, highly active coping style these youth employed in the presence of high risk is associated with cumulative wear and tear on their bodies that increases the risk for these young adults for the chronic diseases of aging.”The findings support the suggestion that poor health and health disparities during adulthood are tied to earlier experiences. Youths who don’t cope as well, have low self-esteem and struggle in school and with friends show elevated levels of stress hormones, blood pressure and body mass index, or BMI, as well.About 10 percent of the population surveyed in Brody’s research fell into this category. These health markers are risk factors for early onset diabetes, cardiovascular disease, stroke, hypertension and cancer.“For kids who are doing well and have outwardly beaten the odds, it is very important for them to be monitored and have yearly checkups so that if they have elevations in these risk factors they can be attended to,” he said.  Consistent with the research at the Center for Family Research, Brody is now researching the impact of prevention programs on at-risk youth. Tianyi Yu, Edith Chen, Gregory Miller, Steven Kogan and Steven Beach co-authored this paper.

7-Jun-13,UGA students resigned as interest rates on loans set to double,"If nothing is resolved on Capitol Hill by July 1, students may want to rethink their financial aid plans.
The interest rates for federally subsidized loans is set to double from 3.4 percent to 6.8, which makes applying for loans a more delicate process.
“I’m an independent student,” said 18-year-old sophomore Melissa Lehman. “I realize that graduating school debt-free is not really possible now … and I know that more than half of everybody that went to college has debt.”


 


On May 31, President Obama urged students to keep a watchful eye on their state representatives during a press conference. And he criticized members of Congress, in hopes they’ll rectify House Resolution 119, which was drafted to combat the imminent interest hike.
In the midst of the political turmoil over the resolution, the president acknowledges the severity of student debt.
“Since most of today’s college students were born, tuition and fees at public universities have more than doubled,” Obama said. “And these days, the average student who takes out loans to pay for four years of college graduates owing more than $26,000.”
And Lehman is no different. Even with two grants and a part-time job, she is already $8,000 in debt after her first year of accepting subsidized loans — and she expects to be $35,000 in debt by graduation.
From fiscal year 2007-2008 until 2011-2012, the amount of UGA undergraduate subsidized loans has almost doubled from 4,420 to 8,059, with an increase of $16,112,750 in loans to nearly 32 million.
“Unless they make school more affordable, there’s not really a solution,” she said. “You need a college education to get a job now, it’s just not feasible.”
There is a small silver lining if the interest rate doubles: according to the Office of Student Financial Aid, the shift in interest rate only affects students taking out loans afterJuly 1. Students who have taken out loans prior to July 1 will accrue the previous 3.4 percent rate.
OSFA Coordinator of Outreach Joseph Boyles warns though, that “this increase is not a possibility, it is current regulation.”


 


But there are some students, regardless of possible interest rates changes, who expect to be drowning in debt post-graduation.
Law student Kabir Sharma is looking at $85,000 of debt — a year into his graduate program. Although he can no longer apply for subsidized loans as a graduate student, Sharma is still receiving Federal PLUS Loans and other direct unsubsidized loans.  
“Due to the Budget Control Act (BCA) of 2011, beginning with the 2012-2013 academic year graduate students are no longer eligible for a Federal Direct Subsidized Loan,” Boyles said in an e-mail interview.
Prior to the 2012-2013 year, the number of UGA graduate subsidized loans increased from 3,366 (FY 2007-2008) to 4,089 (FY 2011-2012). Although the increase is minimal compared to the undergrad numbers, the amount awarded to graduate students increased from $29,868,989 to nearly $43 million.
When Sharma attended the University of California Irvine as an undergrad, he accrued $40,000 of debt, doubling since his move to Georgia in 2011. He expects to be $120,000 in debt post-graduation.
“It’s problematic,” Sharma said. “You’ve already finished about 80 percent of your trip, you know? And loans are just the easiest way.”
He’s not scared of his future debt, but it does shape his post-collegiate decisions.
“I don’t brood over it,” Sharma said. “I’m calm, mostly because I’m in law school. And I’m hoping I will get a decent job … but what worries me is the lack of flexibility and it makes what you do very narrow with your life.”


TNCMS.AdManager.render({region: 'fixed-big-ad-bottom-asset', slot: 1, fold: ""below""});


His financial sacrifice for education may leave him pigeon-holed in the future.
“Like lenders, I’ve talked to Equifax twice,” he said. “And they’ve told me people who have education debts have a harder time getting car loans, home loans, so-on-and-so-forth. That plays a pretty big part explicitly and implicitly.”
And he debates if his choice of job will reflect his amount of debt.
“Even if I get multiple opportunities, it basically constrains me, taking me to one path, which is high-pay,” Sharma said. “Even if it’s high-pay, high-stress, or a really boring job. I’m more inclined to pursue that compared to a medium or low paying job that could be entertaining or fun.”
Lehman would likely agree.
“Obviously getting a job is going to be a little more important me than someone who hasn’t [taken out loans],” she said. “And also I’m probably not going to want to move either, because that’s just another added expense.”
Sharma believes that his post-collegiate debt will even intervene in his romantic affairs.
“When I think about my debt, I basically just have to go for money,” he said. “And it can interfere with having a family and it delays that for me.” 

As July 1 approaches, students will have to wait and wonder about their financial futures. And Lehman, only a year into her education, plans to keep working her part-time job at the UGA Call Center — and applying for scholarships.
She confides in her mother for financial advice and Lehman is skeptical if she’ll need the loans her entire collegiate career.
But for now, like many others, she has no other choice.
“It sucks,” Lehman said. “But you can’t do anything about it.”",Randy Schafer,uganews,https://www.redandblack.com/uganews/politics/uga-students-resigned-as-interest-rates-on-loans-set-to/article_a940c1b6-cfbc-11e2-98b1-001a4bcf6878.html
12-Jun-13,"Jonathan Byrd brings classic songwriting, southern twist to Hendershot's","The son of a preacher man, Jonathan Byrd is a Southerner to the bone, and his evocative folk songs speak to the South in all of us — songs he will share with Athens when he comes to Hendershot's Coffee Bar on June 12
“I was really turned onto songwriting through those traditional songs that have come down through the filter of 100, several hundred years sometimes,” Byrd said. “There’s something very basic about humanity in all of those songs.”
Born in North Carolina, Byrd’s childhood was largely spent in Germany before returning to the states at age 13. He left high school and went straight into the military, spending four years on a tank landing ship before returning to Virginia to seek his fortune. A veteran of innumerable short-lived rock bands, Byrd didn’t get into folk music until he started listening to classic folk singers.


 


Byrd’s traditional influences can be heard in his music. A combination of various Southern sensibilities, Byrd’s songwriting features tales of hard living, heavy drinking and beat-down determination.
“The sound of the band is kind of the sound of me,” Byrd said. “ I’m a North Carolina, sort of southern-style flat picker, a blue grass flat picker, but I’m more of a Texas songwriter.”
His musical approach can be heard on all five of his albums, the most recent of which, ""Cackalack,"" was released in 2011.
Byrd does his best to make songs that tell stories, but the music always comes first. He rarely writes lyrics without already knowing the music behind them.
“I think literature is a lot in my writing,” Byrd said. “When I start constructing the words I look to literary forms, creating strong characters, those things that book writers think about.”
Byrd’s biggest influences are classic songwriters. His musical style is inspired by Doc Watson, while his songwriting is inspired by the legendary Townes Van Zandt.
“[Van Zandt] is one of the brilliant people,” Byrd said. “He’s a drunk, he was a terrible, disorganized, a broken person, but his art was so strong that it still came through and people know about him.”
Byrd’s best tool in songwriting success is his longstanding involvement in the folk community.


 


“It’s amazing to be in a community like that, thinking about other communities of artists in times past and how they make each other stronger and push each other,” Byrd said. “I listen to my community probably more than I listen to anyone famous or on the radio. I listen to people I’ve met around campfires at festivals.”
Byrd is quick to point out why Athenians should come to the show.
""My band is so easy to talk about. My band is very, very good,"" Byrd said. ""They work very hard, and then there are a couple songs where they don't play anything, they just watch me play a song. Love them.""

13-Jun-13,Dean of the day: Building a ‘college without boundaries’,"The University of Georgia’s College of Engineering shines when compared to other engineering schools’ programs. Ranked as the 14th best biological and agricultural engineering graduate program in the nation, according to a U.S. News & World Report’s list, UGA has quickly built a reputation since its 2012 establishment.
Adding to this reputation is the new dean for the college, Donald Leo, a professor of mechanical engineering and vice president and executive director of the National Capital Region operations of Virginia Tech.
Having previously worked as the associate dean for research and graduate studies at the Virginia Tech College of Engineering, Leo has surrounded himself with engineering since his first day at Virginia Tech.


 


“I couldn’t imagine a more perfect candidate – he’s got the background, the experience and personality to be very, very successful,” said Beth Howell, program manager for the Center for Intelligent Material Systems.
Howell, having worked with Leo for 15 years, said he was well-received at Virginia Tech, and will exceed expectations at UGA.
“I’ve been working with him when he was a brand new assistant professor here, and it’s been an absolute pleasure to work with him all the way through his career,” Howell said. “I even continued to help him even when he wasn’t in my department anymore. He’s just been wonderful to work with over the years. He’s going to just do a great job.”
While the dean changes have instilled fear into some people, the reasoning relates to the school wanting to find the right person.
“It is a little scary that there have been so many dean changes,” said Jordan Barker, a junior environmental engineering major from Ringgold. “But I don’t think it’s tied to how long the college has existed. I think it’s older than most people realize.”
Leo agreed with this belief, saying the college, despite its short existence, has already developed an “environment” within UGA.
“There’s a long history of engineering at UGA,” Leo said. “Even though the engineering college is new, there is a history and tradition, and there is a culture that the college has developed. I’m interested on how we can build on that. One of my first initiatives is to learn and really learn about the faculty, learn about the students, learn about the environment that we already have and build on that.”  
Leo said he plans to expand the environment to reach people throughout the area and make it a “focal point,” even for people outside of UGA.


 


“I really want engineering to become a part of the UGA and Athens community,” he said. “It will be a privilege to lead the development of a new engineering college at a top-ranked public institution,” Leo said in a College of Engineering news release, “and I look forward to working with the students, staff and faculty to grow the college and build upon the considerable strengths of the University of Georgia.”
While he is nervous for his upcoming deanship, Leo said it will not stop him from expanding what he believes is a “college without boundaries.”
“Am I a little nervous? Yeah, a little nervous,” Leo said, “but that’s one nervous excitement in the sense that I know there’s going to be challenges, but I think those challenges are always occurring when you try to develop a new organization. I feel privileged to take what’s done in the past and grow a college that expands technical disciplines.”",Brad Mannion,uganews,https://www.redandblack.com/uganews/dean-of-the-day-building-a-college-without-boundaries/article_03364b64-d3a0-11e2-9175-0019bb30f31a.html
15-Jun-13,Rose of Athens' 'Tempest' puts a gender-bending twist on a Shakespeare classic,"The Rose of Athens is celebrating their seventh season of making Shakespeare accessible to all Athenians with their Shakespeare on the Lawn production of “The Tempest.""
Rose of Athens players have built a spectacular outdoor set and filled it with veterans and newcomers alike.
“All the different groups bring a different kind of joy and energy,” said T. Anthony Marotta, a University of Georgia assistant professor of theatre and film studies and the show’s director. “The biggest challenge as a director is stopping and figuring out what each production needs.”


 


“The Tempest” is considered by most to be Shakespeare’s last play, and remains one of his most vital and engaging; its magical realism, small cast, and deviation from iambic pentameter make it more active and accessible than many of The Bard’s more historically-based tales.
It’s a play that can build big, exciting set pieces while still managing to highlight Shakespeare’s characters and dialogue, a balance that’s difficult to maintain but fantastic when it works.
Marotta, a recent transplant from the Utah Shakespeare festival, built his show around the themes of power and control. Filling his stage with puppets and shadows, he’s created an environment that shows just how his characters are forever dancing on each other’s strings.
“The main idea we’re looking at is the idea of people who are in power, and the people who have power over them,” Marotta said. “The more power you have, the more you lose your humanity, and the more people who have power over you, the more you lose your humanity.”
Some of the most interesting decisions that Marotta has made are in the casting process.
Originally conceived as an all-female production, Marotta’s casting has focused on throwing off expectations for the characters. One of his biggest changes has been to the role of Caliban. Generally a male role, Marotta’s Caliban is played by UGA associate professor of theatre and film studies Kristin Kundert-Gibbs, a longtime professional who relishes playing a different, difficult role.
“It’s great fun. I am better than any Caliban ever,” Kundert-Gibbs joked. “The play’s filled with fairies and sprites and all that. In that sort of world, a female Caliban is nothing that stands out.”
Another major change has come to the character of Ariel, the sprite and minion of Prospero, the overthrown Duke of Milan-turned-sorcerer whose machinations are at the center of the play.


 


A constantly-changing role, Ariel has been interpreted in many ways over the years, but this production’s may be one of the strangest interpretations ever to reach the stage. Ariel has been divided into three parts, each representing one of the four elements.
UGA students Caleb Huett and Stephanie Ann Murphy play the fire and air versions of Ariel, respectively, while the water role has been further divided into a cluster of young girls. The fourth element, earth, is represented through Kundert-Gibbs’ Caliban.
“We’re playing with the idea of the yin and the yang of Ariel, the different sides,” said Murphy, an MFA graduate student. “We’re both very different physical types — and obviously we’re a man and the woman — but we both make similar physical choices, and we discovered a lot in the role.”
While the production may feature some unconventional choices, it’s the execution that really makes Rose of Athens’ “Tempest” shine. Fresh and new while still holding to the traditions of Shakespeare, the Rose of Athens has created a production full of interest and spectacle for audiences to enjoy.

26-Jun-13,Streets Café overcomes obstacles to bring ‘street food’ from around the world to Athens,"Local chef Ryan Morgan worked in restaurants all his life, but it wasn’t until he left the restaurant business altogether that he found his true calling.“I started in restaurants when I was 13 with my mom’s restaurant, Strutters, in Atlanta. It was a fried chicken place,” Morgan said. “I worked there through middle school and high school. I’ve been in and out of restaurants kind of across the board as far as high-end and low-end goes, for over 20 years.”Morgan’s food truck, Streets Café, is currently the only legitimate, non-restaurant-affiliated food truck in Athens.


 


Streets Café’s menu is Korean-influenced, featuring hot dogs, French fries, tacos and sliders that are all Asian-inspired, but Streets Café is really focused on “street food” that’s international.“I’m definitely more about leaning towards Asian flavors and stuff in my own home-cooking, but the truck is about just food from around the world. Big, bold, fresh flavors,” Morgan said. “I like Indian and Caribbean-style food, Latin American-style food. Anything you would consider street food is on the table.”Morgan maintains a commissary in downtown Athens where he stores and prepares food and where he parks his truck, but customers have to go mobile to get the full Streets Café experience.“The [most fun] part is actually being on the truck,” Morgan said. “Once you’re there and everything is set up and good to go, just cooking for the customers is by far — it’s hot, sweaty work — but it’s instantly gratifying, because of people liking the food.”Morgan worked in several restaurants in Athens, including Lumpkin Café and Dolce Vita, before the birth of his first child spurred his desire to open Streets Café.“I decided it was time to take the plunge because we had a child, who’s going to be 3 in July,” Morgan said. “Literally the truck was purchased and was supposed to be up and running before he was born, and it took me three years to get it legitimized in town.”Streets Café can regularly be found on Friday and Saturday nights until 2 a.m. outside places such as Little Kings Shuffle Club, Terrapin Brewing Company and Max Bar, but operating his business wasn’t always easy.“In the Caledonia lot three years ago was my first opening. I moved to 40 Watt for a small period of time, then I got a citation from the Health Department because I wasn’t legit. I backed off everything because I wasn’t legit, and that just took so long,” Morgan said. “It would be much easier to be a rogue food truck than a legitimized one, but you’re risking not working the next week.


 


According to Morgan, food-related laws passed ahead of the 1996 Summer Olympics, which are still on the books today, have made it nearly impossible for a food truck to become legitimized by the Health Department.“I’m pretty sure I’m the first one since 1996 that’s solely a truck, not connected to a restaurant,” Morgan said. “For the Olympics they rewrote the laws so people couldn’t just pull over on the side of [state route] 400 and serve food. They got rid of anything on public property, but then afterwards, they never changed anything.”Morgan aspires to possibly start bringing in “celebrity chefs” from certain Athens restaurants to sell their own menu out of the truck “one or two nights a week,” in addition to his ultimate goal: opening up an Athens-based food truck park.“I’m actively now trying to put together a food truck park with this other lady, trying to get something going to bring in more trucks,” Morgan said. “I’ve had a couple people come by the commissary to see how it’s done the way [the Health Department] wants it, so that gives them something to see what they’re up against.”Despite the odds, Morgan has high hopes for both his celebrity chef idea and an Athens food truck park.“Apparently opening the food truck wasn’t really possible,” Morgan said, “but I did it.”",Chelsey Abercrombie,variety,https://www.redandblack.com/variety/streets-caf-overcomes-obstacles-to-bring-street-food-from-around/article_a603b818-de7c-11e2-856e-001a4bcf6878.html
28-Jun-13,‘Superstar’ engineering dean retires from UGA,"After 38 years of service to the University of Georgia, Dale Threadgill finally decided to turn in his key to the dean’s office for the College of Engineering.Threadgill, interim dean for the college, was honored this Thursday with a retirement reception in the rotunda of the Coverdell Center, where more than 80 people came to recognize his near-mythical determination in all he has done for the college.“Dale must have thought he was in that Greek myth – constantly pushing the boulder up, and it was always falling back down once again,” UGA President-elect Jere Morehead said. “But he literally never gave up, and his persistence, his determination, his will that this was going to happen is the reason that all of us are here today.”


 


Threadgill, along with being the interim dean of the college since July 1, 2012, has worked with UGA on campuses other than the one located in Athens, and he has left a positive mark on all these places.“Dale’s loyalty and his devotion…to the University of Georgia have never been questioned by anyone,” Morehead said. “He had a transformative impact on this institution. You have my sincere thanks and my best wishes for a job well done.”His work with UGA, in combination with his efforts made before coming to the school, has deemed Threadgill a “superstar” in engineering, said Professor Emeritus Ron McClendon.“He’s a hard worker – I think we’ve all seen that,” McClendon said. “He’s tireless, stubborn and he doesn’t give up easy, and we’re all thankful for that.”Concluding the speakers was yet another man with few remaining days at his position, UGA President Michael Adams.Adams, who played a part in giving it the “old college try” in establishing the College of Engineering, spoke on Threadgill’s longtime commitment in making the dream of this college come to fruition.“From our first encounter,” Adams said, “Dale pushed me for a college of engineering.”David Gattie, associate professor in the College of Engineering and host of the reception, presented Threadgill with two tokens of appreciation – a watercolor painting by Jamie Calkin and an “official” UGA rocking chair.


 


“Everyone knew Dale had the most God-awful taste in chairs,” Gattie said.Speaking on his own behalf, Threadgill admired his time at UGA and told the crowd he showed no regret in coming here, despite the skepticism from his peers at Mississippi State University.“Around 38 years ago, I was considering coming over to UGA,” he said. “But everyone told me not to do so, and I’m glad I didn’t listen to them.”",Brad Mannion,uganews,https://www.redandblack.com/uganews/organizations/superstar-engineering-dean-retires-from-uga/article_58697532-e018-11e2-b4d8-001a4bcf6878.html
5-Jul-13,"Bulldogs football roundup: Clemson smack-talk, drunk boating and surgery","It's been a week full of interesting developments for Georgia's football program. Some of these have been well-received, like Kendall Baker's commitment on Wednesday night.But if your name is Marshall Morgan, this week was definitely not good.Morgan was arrested and charged with BUI (boating under the influence) on Lake Sinclair last Saturday. No suspension has been announced yet, but this type of infraction carries a mandatory 10 percent of the regular season suspension under Georgia's conduct policy.


 


So by all accounts, it looks as if the team's starting placekicker will miss at least one game, if not more, to start the 2013 season. Of course, the word ""starting"" can be used loosely because Morgan attempted all of 14 field goals in 2012 (he made eight of them).As for who could temporarily replace Morgan, sophomore Patrick Beless and redshirt freshman Thomas Pritchard are listed as the backups at kicker on Georgia's most recent depth chart.But there's another player who could have an inside track on getting the nod, and that is junior Adam Erickson, the team's second-string punter and holder last season. ""As far as the next guy in line goes, I have worked with Adam Erickson for three years and I have great confidence that he will be able to step in and do the job,"" former Bulldog kicker Blair Walsh said to the Athens Banner-Herald.Though Erickson got most of his work at punter last year, with brief appearances in the Buffalo and Florida Atlantic games, he also hit a 46-yard field goal in the 2012 G-Day game and made a 19-yard try in this year's spring game.So while the battle for fill-in kicker is still open, we're starting to get an idea of who the early favorite will be heading into the start of fall practice.Tiger wideout talks too muchClemson wide receiver Sammy Watkins caused a little bit of a stir last week in a story penned by Bart Wright of GreenvilleOnline.com. 


 


In it, Watkins claimed that the Tigers are ""championship material"" that should put up a ""11-1, 12-0"" record this season. He also called himself the best receiver in the Atlantic Coast Conference, and predicted that he would go for at least 1,400 yards and 13-16 touchdowns in 2013.Oh yeah, and he said that Clemson would ""beat the mess out of"" Georgia.None of those things are out of the question, of course. Watkins made 57 receptions for 708 yards in just seven starts last season, an impressive performance. With the relative weakness of the ACC, I suppose any halfway decent team could manage 11 wins, too. Just look at last year's Florida State squad.And the Tigers could technically come out and destroy the Bulldogs this August, which would be a very different outcome from the last time these two teams met (Georgia won 30-0 in 2003).But Watkins really didn't need to say anything, especially with the start of the season nearly two months away. And I'd bet he also just provided Georgia's coaches with some bulletin board material to feed the young secondary in the weeks leading up to week one versus Clemson.That game is on Aug. 31, by the way. At least save the smack-talk until SEC Media Days or something.Georgia's new JUCO man: healthy or unhealthy?Junior defensive tackle Toby Johnson, a 6-foot-4, 305-pound JUCO transfer, underwent surgery on Tuesday for ""a condition not related to football and he is expected to make a full recovery, according to the release.

Suffice it to say, Johnson's latest surgery does not sound serious.The real question for Johnson, however, is how he recovers from tearing his ACL and MCL last November, an injury which prematurely ended his sophomore season at Hutchinson Community College.And if what Garrison Smith says is any indication, then Johnson is doing just fine in summer workouts.""I can barely tell he ever had any problems. He looks 100 percent to me,"" said Smith, a senior defensive end. ""He's in good shape already, doing everything.""With plenty of spots up for grabs on defense, Johnson could be contributing to the Bulldogs earlier than many thought.- Alec Shirkey is a senior from Dunwoody majoring in English and Finance",ALEC SHIRKEY,sports,https://www.redandblack.com/sports/bulldogs-football-roundup-clemson-smack-talk-drunk-boating-and-surgery/article_3e5ec210-e599-11e2-8d15-0019bb30f31a.html
14-Jul-13,American Sign Language Festival to provide hands-on experience for UGA,"As a part of the Georgia Association of the Deaf’s biennial conference, there will be an American Sign Language Festival on July 20 from 1 p.m. to 5 p.m. at the Georgia Center for Continuing Education’s Mahler Hall.The event is open to everyone, even those who don’t know sign language, with an admission price of $5.All funds will go to the Georgia Association of the Deaf.


 


This will be the first time the event happens although Peterson and her husband, the other proposer of the event, hope it will become a regular tradition. “We anticipate more than 100 people in attendance,” Amy Peterson, one of the festival's proposers, said.There will be performances from a group consisting of deaf individuals from different countries that reside in Georgia, Peterson said.There will also be presentations on the history, culture and language of American Sign Language.“This is a good way for the deaf, hard of hearing, deaf/blind and hearing to be a part of the festival to get a glimpse of history, culture and language of American Sign Language within the deaf community,” Peterson said.“When this festival is over, you will learn several new signs,” Peterson said.",Stephen Mays,uganews,https://www.redandblack.com/uganews/organizations/american-sign-language-festival-to-provide-hands-on-experience-for/article_bb218c30-eca9-11e2-8fb5-0019bb30f31a.html
23-Jul-13,Chris Wilson hire paying quick dividends on recruiting trail,"When former defensive line coach Rodney Garner was hired away by Auburn, the reaction among Georgia fans was one of concern.Garner had been much more than a standout position coach for the Bulldogs – he was also the team’s recruiting ace, a man who had helped the school land top-end prospects such as John Jenkins, Damian Swann and Alec Ogletree in recent years.And while new defensive line coach Chris Wilson came in with Southeastern Conference experience after spending three years at Mississippi State, many still wondered if Wilson would be able to recruit as well as Garner had while in Athens.


 


Further questions were raised after the team missed out on five-star defensive tackle Montravius Adams, who more or less followed Garner to Auburn while Wilson was still scrambling to get settled with the Bulldogs. The loss of junior nose tackle Kwame Geathers, who somewhat surprisingly declared early for the NFL Draft, was yet another blow to a defensive front graduating two starters.But since National Signing Day, Wilson has quelled those concerns emphatically by playing an integral role in the recruitment of several big name prospects, the most notable being four-star defensive tackle Lamont Gaillard, who verbally committed to Georgia on Saturday. In addition, the Bulldogs have drawn 2014 commitments from four-star defensive tackle Kendall Baker, four-star defensive tackle Dontravius Russell and three-star linebacker Detric Dukes.Perhaps most importantly, Wilson was able to salvage missing out on Adams by swaying four-star JUCO defensive tackle Toby Johnson to sign on with Georgia. Johnson’s presence may not be a sure thing in the short term after suffering an ACL tear last November, but all signs out of summer workouts point to promising progress in his rehab efforts, and he could become a valuable contributor in the fall.It’s not just Wilson impressing in Garner’s absence, either.The entire Bulldogs coaching staff has simply killed it on the recruiting trail over the summer, picking up five verbal commitments during the Mark Richt football camps and four more over Dawg Night weekend. Two of the most impressive out of that group – four-star quarterback Jacob Park and the state’s top running back Nick Chubb – were even recruited (in part) by the oft-criticized Mike Bobo.The Bulldogs have plenty of time to make this class even better, too. Five-star Norcross defensive end Lorenzo Carter is still in play, while five-star linebacker Raekwon McMillan has Georgia on his top-five list of schools. Four-star outside linebacker Christian Miller is another high-end prospect with UGA on his list.All of a sudden, Georgia looks like it could wind up with a top-five recruiting class assuming the team doesn't lose its big-name recruits.Given how often players decommit, I’m not so sure that’s a safe assumption, and I recognize that the book is hardly even written on Wilson considering he has barely spent six months with the Bulldogs.


 


But if the past few months are any indication of future success, then both Wilson and his peers should continue to do an exceptional job in that oh-so-fickle field of recruiting.– Alec Shirkey is a senior from Dunwoody majoring in English and Finance",ALEC SHIRKEY,sports,https://www.redandblack.com/sports/chris-wilson-hire-paying-quick-dividends-on-recruiting-trail/article_a20415c0-f3bf-11e2-8b7c-0019bb30f31a.html
25-Jul-13,Fourth and goal: Murray carries lofty expectations into final season,"It is not rare to hear football players say “every yard counts.” Though not quite insightful, the phrase is considered a fairly inarguable claim, another truth in a game with many.But for Aaron Murray, “every yard counts” is a painful reminder of how close he came to finishing off Alabama in the Southeastern Conference Championship game last December. It is what he hears in his sleep. It is what drives him in the morning.It is perhaps for that final five-yard deficiency alone that Murray returns to Georgia this fall for one last crack at a national title.


 


“Every night it goes through my mind. I've watched that [game] four times now,” Murray said. ""You want to forgot the outcome and how it ended and how close you were, but we gained [experience] from that game. The thought that we’re right there, Georgia’s back.""Georgia football is back, with players reporting to practice as soon as July 30.But for Murray, the season never really ended. Even while the wounds were still fresh, he took almost no time in revisiting the C.J. Mosley tipped pass that wobbled into Chris Conley's arms as the clock expired.“Aaron watched the film the next day. He wanted to go that night,"" senior tight end Arthur Lynch said. “I’m sure the last series is what he was going to.""""[The last play] was a quick two-minute call we do every Thursday in practice,"" said Mosley, now a senior linebacker with the Crimson Tide. ""It was a big play in my career. I’ve done that plenty of times before, it was just a bigger stage of the game.""With the experience of that heartbreaking defeat in his back pocket, Murray returns to Athens as a battle-hardened veteran with three years of SEC experience, a year older and perhaps wiser, too. The Tampa, Fla. native has seen plenty of ups and downs since taking the reins of Georgia's offense, and since the season's conclusion he's become even more comfortable as a vocal leader.“I guess I’ve had my time of having fun. I’m an old man now,” Murray joked. ""If some people need some yelling, a kick in the butt, I’m there as well. Definitely have grown a lot more comfortable in that role.""Those closest to the team have seen growth in Georgia's quarterback, as well. Whether leading teammates through voluntary summer practices or spending time in the film room, Murray has taken on an expansive role in making sure the Bulldogs are prepared for the season.


 


""[He's] not just game day or even a practice quarterback. I really see him as a 365-day quarterback,""head coach Mark Richt said. ""Every single day he's got a plan to get better personally.  He has a plan to try to help his teammates get better, just how he eats, how he trains, how he rests himself.  He's a great example for our young guys the way he studies film.""Murray even took it upon himself to create a new method of organizing and leading the team through summer workouts. After collaborating with a pair of UGA professors involved in his graduate Psychology program, he devised a system of breaking the team up into several small groups, each led by an upperclassman responsible for making sure players show up.The incentive? Each member of the group with the best attendance record for the first and second halves of the summer wins a free meal at Longhorn Steakhouse.""We break up into teams and meet once a week with our teams. There’s 15 leaders, each team has about eight players. And you meet to talk about goals, talk about how you progress this week. So maybe I’m with a tight end, a linebacker, a cornerback,"" Murray said. “It’s been great. If someone in your group misses a workout, you’re hearing about it from someone else in the group because everyone wants that free Longhorn’s dinner.”Despite Murray's enthusiasm, it also seems that keeping tabs on teammates and running offseason drills was more taxing than he might have first thought.""He goes ‘I can’t wait until camp starts, I’m tired of coaching, man.’ It’s hard to coach and practice, but he does it so well,"" Richt said.While Murray has drawn rave reviews off the field, there's a strong chance he could do serious damage on game days, too.After throwing for his third straight 3,000-yard season and posting the nation's second-best passer efficiency rating at 174.82, Murray enters the season on a plethora of watch lists for honors such as the Maxwell Award and the Davey O'Brien Award. However, he was only named Third-Team Preseason All-SEC by media members behind Heisman Trophy winner Johnny Manziel and Alabama's A.J. McCarron.

A Third-Team slection certainly speaks to the impressive talent at quarterback in the SEC, but Lynch felt he had to disagree with the media's ruling.""I think [Murray] is the best quarterback in the country and in the SEC. I don’t care what the predictions say and the preseason and postseason rankings, the Heisman, whatever it is. The time that he’s put in and what our program has asked him to do is pretty impressive. I don’t think anyone else has that kind of responsibility upon their shoulders,"" he said.Both Murray and his teammates are excited to have one more year of No. 11 running the Bulldogs offense. He'll have more UGA and SEC records to break, and should go down as one of the most prolific passers in school history. But for now, the goal is singular: bring a title back to UGA.""He came back to win an SEC Championship, a national championship. That's what we all want to do as a program, and I think we will,” Lynch said.",ALEC SHIRKEY,sports,https://www.redandblack.com/sports/fourth-and-goal-murray-carries-lofty-expectations-into-final-season/article_b92dfd86-f3c6-11e2-9bc6-0019bb30f31a.html
25-Jul-13,Bluegrass superstar Claire Lynch brings glass ceiling-smashing sound to Melting Point,"Novelty act and trailblazing heroine, naïve debutante and sagely songmistress, backwoods girl and big city woman — Claire Lynch has seen it all, and done most of it twice.A longtime fixture in the bluegrass scene, Claire Lynch got her start in 1973 with a little-known band called Hickory Wind. At just 18 years-old, she was an anomaly in a field dominated by old mountain men with her striking presence and sweetly melodic voice that stood out against a field dominated by rough-edged singers with long beards and low-slung guitars.“When I started, my surroundings were fairly humble,” Lynch said. “I did get to play a lot of the festivals, which were much more sophisticated. They had beautiful lights, better stage management, were just much less countrified.”


 


After touring with Hickory Wind, the group changed its name to the Front Porch String Band in the mid-70’s, winning acclaim and awards as they became one of the key players in the rapidly evolving bluegrass scene. Retiring from the road in 1981, the group was dormant for over ten years, only to return in 1991 with “Lines and Traces,” an album that would kick off a string of well-deserved nominations and awards for the now-beloved group, including two GRAMMY nominations and a 1997 International Bluegrass Music Association win for Lynch as Female Vocalist of the Year.The Front Porch String Band retired once again in 2000, and Lynch went with them. Believing she was done with music forever, she retired to focus on her personal songwriting and spend time with her family. Luckily, she couldn’t stay away forever; reinventing herself as a solo artist, Lynch returned in 2005 as the head of the Claire Lynch Band, an ever-shifting bluegrass collective for which she sings and writes the majority of the music. Lynch saw another round of album releases and awards with her new persona, receiving multiple nominations from the IBMA and an induction into the Alabama Bluegrass Hall of Fame. Now with her ninth solo album, “Dear Sister,” under her belt and a recent $50,000 grant from the United States Artist Fellowship, Lynch is positioned to stand tall as a giant of the bluegrass field — and as a groundbreaking heroine to much of its female membership.Emerging as one of the predominant female acts in a largely male-dominated field brings its own set of challenges and barriers to break. While women in bluegrass today are treated as largely equal to their male counterparts, Lynch’s earliest days on the bluegrass circuit were categorized by a cautious acceptance, which sidelined her even as it brought her notoriety.“When I played at first, I felt like everybody liked me, and was welcoming me,” Lynch said. “I was a novelty, a little refreshing spot in the lineup.”While Lynch was never kept down or treated unfairly because of her gender, she still recognizes that the bluegrass culture of the 70’s was a somewhat sexist institution — hardly a surprise, given their longtime members’ history.“It came out of a culture. You look at the Carter family, who used to have to travel around with chaperones, and three women did most of the music,” Lynch said. “I have a friend, Robert Oermann, who wrote a book on country music, and he cited this story: In the 20’s and 30’s, if you were a woman traveling around without a chaperone, a father or a husband or an uncle, you were a hussy, basically! And when I started in 1973, a lot of those traditions were still being preserved. And I think that’s a lot of the reason why it took us women so long to move out of the mountains and into the city.”Lynch believes that while she was only a small part of the sea change that came to the bluegrass circuit, it’s hard to deny that her life and career have helped to create a culture where women are rewarded for their work, rather than shunned or set aside.“Women have really come into their own. A lot of women are headlining bands now, when that was almost unheard of when I first started out,” Lynch said. “We’ve really come a long way from that era…all that stuff’s gone now. It’s a good thing.”

28-Jul-13,"Dawgs off the leash: Rambo shines, former Bulldog named head coach","Western Carolina recently named former Bulldog standout Bryant Odom as its new men's head golf coach. Odom is leaving his old post as an assistant coach at Wisconsin.Odom previously served as a graduate assistant at Georgia during the 2010 and 2011 seasons. In 2010, the Bulldogs won the Southeastern Conference Team Championship and finished runner-up in the NCAA tournament.Odom played at Georgia from 1998 to 2002. During those years, Georgia won 13 tournaments, including the 1999 National Championship and the 1998, 2000 and 2001 SEC titles. Odom made All-SEC honors three times, and in 2001 he was an All-American.


 


Rambo continues to impress in training campSafety Baccari Rambo impressed the Washington Redskins so much in rookie minicamps this summer that he is now being considered a potential starter at free safety for the team. The former sixth-round pick spent the first day of training camp last week practicing with the first-team defense.“It’s a big opportunity. I just have to go out there and show them I know what I’m doing and make plays,” he said to the Washington Post. “They just asked did I know what I was doing, and said I was going to get some first-team reps. So I’m just trying to take advantage of the opportunity.”Stafford, Lions reach contract extensionMatthew Stafford agreed to a three-year contract extension worth $53 million with the Detroit Lions earlier this month. The former Georgia quarterback had two years worth $23.5 million remaining on his previous contract. He is now locked up with the Lions through the 2017 season and has $43 million in guarantees during that time. Stafford is entering his fifth season as the Lions' signal-caller and will look to take the team deep into the postseason this year. Despite setting an NFL record in pass attempts last season, Stafford was unable to throw for more than 20 touchdowns.",SAM LACK,sports,https://www.redandblack.com/sports/golf/dawgs-off-the-leash-rambo-shines-former-bulldog-named-head/article_1e929758-f7ce-11e2-8f93-0019bb30f31a.html
29-Jul-13,Football notebook: Bulldogs to begin practice Tuesday,"Georgia's season opener at Clemson may still be a month away, but for the players it begins on Tuesday when they officially report to practice.From then onward, the Bulldogs will conduct almost four weeks worth of fall training camp practices. Defensive end Garrison Smith, one of the few seniors on a defense now full of freshmen, is up to the challenge of leading that young group through the season.“I’m just doing the best I can to be the senior leader, that’s my job. I’m just doing the best I can trying to help these young guys out,” he said.


 


And while it has been freshmen such as Tray Matthews that have garnered headlines since the spring, there are some slightly older faces that could be battling for starting spots during camp. Two of those, defensive linemen Sterling Bailey and Jonathan Taylor, have impressed Smith early on.“Sterling Bailey and Jonathan Taylor [look good],"" he said. ""We just got young guys everywhere playing every position. I think this is going to be one of those years where there’s not going to be one standout person. Everybody’s going to contribute.”Fix me up, doc!Georgia enters fall camp with a number of notable players that may not be running at full steam right away.Chief among those rehabbing is junior wide receiver Michael Bennett, whose season was cut short after tearing his ACL last November. At that point, he had already managed 24 receptions for 345 yards in just five appearances. All reports out of summer workouts seem to indicate that Bennett will be ready for the start of the season.“[Bennett] is close to 100 percent. He says he feels great, he feels fine. My conversation with the quarterbacks this summer is they like the way he looks,” offensive coordinator Mike Bobo said on Wednesday.Another big name to watch in the coming weeks could be junior defensive lineman Toby Johnson, a JUCO transfer who also suffered an ACL tear last season. He too should not be expected to miss any time once practice begins this week.


 


“Toby’s a guy that will be out there practicing day one. He’s a guy that will probably play at the end position,"" defensive coordinator Todd Grantham said. ""He’s got some athletic ability, he just hasn’t done the system yet, so we’ll just have to see what he can handle and how he progresses on the field to see how much he can help us.”Of course, the Bulldogs also have one late returnee (not from injury, but ineligibility) that could be in the mix on the offensive line. That player would be fourth-year junior Kolton Houston, who was reinstated by the NCAA on Thursday.Houston was not picky about where he could end up playing for Georgia.“I don’t care, you can line me up at tight end or receiver. I’m going to leave all that to [offensive line] coach [Will] Friend and coach Bobo,” he said.Stacked at running backPerhaps no group enters the 2013 season with as much talent and depth as this year's stable of running backs, which is spearheaded by sophomore and 1,000-yard rusher Todd Gurley.""He’s 6-foot-2, he’s about 230 [pounds] and he can run like any other running back I’ve ever seen,"" senior tight end Arthur Lynch said. ""He’s a guy who went out to track, not in track shape, in January and qualified for the SEC Championships because he’s that good at hurdles. He’s just physically gifted.""And it isn't just Gurley's on-the-field success that set him apart from his peers as a freshman, either.


TNCMS.AdManager.render({region: 'fixed-big-ad-bottom-asset', slot: 1, fold: ""below""});


“The thing about Todd is that he is not afraid to speak up. He is not afraid to talk. He is not afraid to break down a huddle. I think he has a lot of leadership skills because he isn’t afraid to say something,” Bobo said.Of course, the Bulldogs have another running back in sophomore Keith Marshall that could feasibly start for several other D-I programs. However, ""Gurshall"" seems to have no problems with its dual nature of existence.“I think Gurley and Marshall are poster boys for collegiate athletics,"" head coach Mark Richt said. ""I think both of them want to be considered the lead back, but they also wanted to share the load.”As for who could be the third back in Bobo's offensive attack, 5-foot-9 freshman J.J. Green, who enrolled in January and impressed in spring practice, may see himself getting touches this fall.“JJ can definitely get in there a lot. He’s more of that scatback. He runs extremely hard. You watch our spring game, he runs his tail off every single play. Great hands out of the backfield, very shifty guy. I definitely think he can get a lot of snaps this year,” senior quarterback Aaron Murray said.",ALEC SHIRKEY,sports,https://www.redandblack.com/sports/football-notebook-bulldogs-to-begin-practice-tuesday/article_927ac51c-f7d0-11e2-8af2-0019bb30f31a.html

If you’re looking for an Athens-based retailer to get your back-to-school shop on, look no further than these five options:EntourageLocated on South Milledge, Entourage’s business model can be summed up in one word: sale. If you sign up for its rewards club text alerts, it will send you more coupons, promotional ads and sale alerts than your creepy ex after one too many from Highwire, but fear not: these offers are actually an awesome way to fill your wardrobe with high quality yet inexpensive pieces. Entourage especially gets a shout-out for its jewelry section, where you can find a great pair of bob earrings for as little as $5.


 


Red Dress BoutiqueUnless your parents are mobsters or celebrities (or lawyers for mobsters or celebrities), you may feel the need to sell a kidney when you see the prices inside this College Avenue boutique, but if you’re shopping for a special occasion, Red Dress is the place to go. A best friend’s engagement party or graduation day are both worth a little splurge, and Red Dress is the place to go to make it happen.Plato’s ClosetWhile Plato’s is a chain and not a locally-owned business, you can’t beat its prices when it comes to every day basics. H&M separates are available for as low as $10, and even a Calvin Klein maxi dress won’t exceed an $18 price tag. Like most thrift stores, you will have to do some substantial digging at Plato’s, but if you have the time it will pay off in the end.PitayaIn terms of prices, Pitaya lands right in between Entourage and Red Dress Boutique in terms of how hard it’s going to hit you in the good old wallet. The East Jackson Street retailer is always up on the latest trends, however, as it featured pastel jeans and studded bandeaus long before they were featured in any other storefronts. While it can reach somewhat high into the price stratosphere, keep your eyes out for sales to snatch up all the colored denim you could want for fall.America’s ThriftThis Atlanta Highway hideaway is for the DIY-only crowd. Almost everything you find in this thrift store will need some serious TLC, but the rock bottom prices make it the perfect place to find that canvas for all the studs or tie-dye you want to add to your fall wardrobe. You will have to dig a little bit harder than you do at Plato’s Closet, as it retails clothes for all ages and sizes, but on the bright side all proceeds go to charity. Feel good about how you look and how you spend your money by picking up some basics ready to be re-purposed.

6-Aug-13,Football practice report: 15 Bulldogs listed as injured,"The Red & Black had access to three five-minute practice periods that were made available to the media on Tuesday afternoon. The team also held a morning practice session in Sanford Stadium that focused on special teams. Players wore shorts and helmets on what was the sixth day of fall camp for the Bulldogs. Skies were clear and the air rife with the typical Georgia humidity as temperatures sat in the mid-80s. Here is what stood out on the field:
Several Bulldogs were notably absent from practice on Tuesday. Sophomore tight end Jay Rome was listed out with a left ankle sprain, with freshman Jordan Davis taking the second-team reps in his stead. Sophomore linebacker James DeLoach underwent surgery on Monday for a left thumb sprain and linebacker Leonard Floyd also had a procedure done on his left hand Tuesday. Both are expected to make a full recovery in time for the season opener with Clemson, per Director of Sports Medicine Ron Courson. Other notable players who missed practice included offensive linemen Chris Burnette and Watts Dantzler. In all, 15 players were listed as out on Tuesday’s injury report.
A number of defensive backs, including Damian Swann, Brendan Langley and Devin Bowman, worked with secondary coach Scott Lakatos on short-range zone and “cloud coverage” plays. Cloud coverage involves one cornerback covering shallow, while the rest of the defensive backs are responsible for the deep zone and typically roll in the direction of the shallow corner. Lakatos also had his players practice employing bump-and-run coverage while defending short throws.
Georgia’s linebackers also focused on the short-range passing game. Freshmen Reggie Carter, Tim Kimbrough, Ryne Rankin and Johnny O’Neal were among the group that practiced reading the quarterbacks eyes in zone coverage and trying to jump the route if the situation called for it. Ramik Wilson, who is slated to start on the inside next to Amarlo Herrera, successfully intercepted a pass during the drill. 
Cornerbacks Shaq Wiggins and Tray Matthews were not sporting any green, non-contact jerseys in practice today. They did, however, appear to be somewhat limited in their involvement during the brief period of media availability and were listed as limited by the team. Wiggins took to Twitter earlier today, tweeting “Been out of practice for 3 days this [expletive] killen me.” Head coach Mark Richt noted that the injury, among others, would be “a matter of days.”
On the offensive side of things, the quarterbacks practiced connecting on short out and deep corner routes during a drill conducted with the tight ends. Senior tight end Arthur Lynch has continued to look impressive, running crisp routes and showing consistent hands.
The running backs worked on stepping drills in which they’d make a cut to the outside afterwards, with the goal being confidence in footwork so that the back’s vision can stay focused downfield. J.J. Green got some coaching from running backs coach Bryan McClendon: “Don’t duck ya head!” he said to the freshman tailback.

7-Aug-13,Football notebook: Bulldog offense struggles in scrimmage; Richt weighs in on player autographs,"The Georgia Bulldogs have three opportunities to suit up and play among themselves between the hedges before the real test arrives at the end of this month. According to head coach Mark Richt, they didn't rise to the occasion in their first scrimmage Wednesday morning.""The guys looked kind of tired. I think they were trying to fight, but [I] didn't see as much juice,"" Richt said. ""It was a little disappointing to me, quite frankly.""Richt admitted possible mitigating circumstances for his players' stamina. The temperature hovered in the mid-to-high 70s, but despite modest heat and overcast skies, humidity remained an obstacle. But Tuesday's two practices — the first day with more than one practice in camp — likely fatigued the players more. 


 


""It wasn't a real game atmosphere at all in my opinion,"" Richt said. ""You're thinking it's a special day to get in between the hedges and compete. ""I'm not saying when the ball snapped they didn't try their best. I'm not saying they were dogging it in any way. But I just saw a lack of energy and enthusiasm and [I didn't sense] the feeling that hey, this is a special day, let's get after it.""Tight end Arthur Lynch said adjusting to the pace of a full rehearsal took time.""We started out a little sluggish,"" he said. ""We were trying to keep up with our up-tempo offense.""The No. 1 units faced off against their No. 2 counterparts, and according to Lynch, the defensive backups caught the offensive starters by surprise early in the matchup.""We had some turnovers early that we weren't expecting and that kind of threw us off a little bit,"" Lynch said. ""We just gotta keep up tempo [and] realize that we're a no-huddle offense.... We gotta finish plays.""Whatever the excuse, Richt recognizes the urgency of the upcoming season, even if his players didn't in Sanford Stadium Wednesday.""We've got a ways to go and a short time to get there,"" Richt said.


 


 $ign hereRicht and his players were asked to weigh in on the pay-to-sign scandal surrounding Texas A&M quarterback Johnny Manziel yesterday. Today Richt was asked to expand his comments — while no evidence suggests wrongdoing on the part of the Georgia program, it's not hard to find memorabilia autographed by Georgia players for sale online. Richt explained that his players aren't partaking in any wrongdoing in such cases.""We have guys that are friendly,"" Richt said. ""If they're at the grocery store and somebody asks them can I have a picture and would you mind signing this, our guys I'm sure sign it.""They know they can't do anything for money. But... a guy who has some celebrity in his life, most people will stop and take a picture or sign something for someone.""Richt offered Fan Picture Days of the past as an opportunity for hundreds of pieces of memorabilia to pass by Georgia players' hands. During this year's event, however, fans will be provided with two schedule posters for players to sign, and no outside items will be allowed.Regardless of how an autograph may end up online, Richt emphasized that his players live within the bounds of NCAA compliance.""Every man has to understand his responsibility to do things within the rules and hopefully everybody's doing that,"" he said.

 Rare turnoversThe Bulldog quarterbacks combined for six interceptions during Wednesday's scrimmage. Particularly galling were quarterback Aaron Murray's three interceptions in 18 passing attempts. Richt had a simple initial reaction to the turnovers.""The interceptions weren't good, obviously,"" the coach said. ""That can ruin your day.""According to Richt at least some of the interceptions weren't poor decisions, so much as poorly executed.""A couple of those picks were probably thrown to the right guy and the guy was open,"" Richt said. ""But because the ball hung in the air long enough safeties reacted and ran them down, and when they got there they caught it, to their credit.""While the interceptions did represent positive signs about the defensive backs, they raised questions about Richt's experienced quarterback corps.

""If the ball's in the right place rarely will you get a pick as a result,"" the coach said. ""But the balls weren't quite where they were supposed to be and the DBs took advantage of it and made the plays."" Unofficial statsRicht led his press conference with unofficial statistics from the scrimmage, highlighting the players who stood out.Running backs: Keith Marshall: two carries, 80 yards, TD.

9-Aug-13,"Football practice report, day nine: Bulldogs continue to nurse injuries","The Red and Black had access to three five-minute practice periods that were made available to the media on Friday morning. Players wore full pads on what was the ninth day of fall camp for the Bulldogs. Temperatures were in the high 70s with clear skies. Here is what stood out for the Bulldogs:
Freshman cornerback Shaq Wiggins finally rejoined the rest of his unit after missing a few days of practice due to a nagging injury. Safety Tray Matthews was out on the field, but in the green jersey he has worn for much of the week. He had his helmet off and was not participating in any of the drills. As a whole, the secondary worked with position coach Scott Lakatos on holding “the outside release” and forcing the receiver to the interior of the field. Former walk-on Blake Sailors and JUCO transfer Kennar Johnson in particular were being coached up by Lakatos.
Also in a green jersey was junior flanker Blake Tibbs, who did participate in drills with his fellow wide receivers. Position coach Tony Ball led the wideouts in a series of running drills geared towards streak routes and kickoff coverage.
Redshirt sophomore Jay Rome was once again not at practice – he’s missed much of the week due to an ankle sprain. Jordan Davis and Hugh Williams have seen more reps in his place, and on Friday the unit worked with the quarterbacks on maintaining possession after the catch. Offensive coordinator Mike Bobo had his big glove that he uses to knock passes away. Both Davis and Williams would drop passes.
On hand with the inside linebackers was graduate assistant and former Bulldog Christian Robinson, who worked with freshmen Johnny O’Neal and Reggie Carter on tackling in space. Amarlo Herrera also led the unit in a drill that involved the linebackers diving at his feet – simulating a blocker attempting to tie him up – and Herrera pushing his teammates to the ground.
The outside linebackers, a rather thin group on Friday that included Jordan Jenkins, Josh Dawson, Brandon Burrows and Shaun McGee, worked on dropping into shallow coverage after beginning the play in a down stance. Freshmen Leonard Floyd and Davin Bellamy, along with projected starter James DeLoach, are all nursing hand injuries and have missed practice time this week. They are, however, expected to return to action in time for the Aug. 31 game against Clemson.
The running backs ran a drill that focused on the strong toss out of the I-formation and, later, ran another meant to simulate catching a pass out of the backfield and getting upfield quickly. J.J. Green, a former wide receiver, naturally excelled at making those receptions. All three of the fullbacks – Quayvon Hicks, Merritt Hall and Corey Campbell – got their share of critiques from the highly audible Bobo during the strong toss drills.

11-Aug-13,Top JUCO cornerback is commitment No. 17 for UGA,"Shattle Fenteng, one of the top junior college defensive backs in the country, gave his verbal commitment to Georgia Friday night.Fenteng chose the Bulldogs over Ole Miss and Kansas State.“The main thing for me is that I want to win,” Fenteng said in an interview with Kevin Kelley of UGASports.com. “I mean, I want to win a national title and I think Georgia is on their way. They also told me that I am the number one cornerback on their board. I really like that. Not just that, but they also told me that if I was enrolled there right now, I’d have a great shot to play against Clemson in the first game, so I thought that was great, too.”

12-Aug-13,"Brumby breaks barriers, opens doors to boys","Since opening its doors in 1966, Brumby Hall has been the largest single-sex dorm on UGA’s campus, a haven for young women who might not be as comfortable living in the same building as a gaggle of strange young men.This year, however, the housing department has made a rather radical change — for the first time in Brumby’s nearly 50-year history, the dorm will open three of its nine floors to freshman boys, giving the building the same distribution as fellow high-rises Russell and Creswell.“We had a building that was simply larger than our demand for single-sex housing,” said Gerry Kowalski, executive director for UGA's housing Department. “The building was built in the 1960s, and it was just a different kind of culture back then ... we felt that it was time to make that changeover.”


 


The department decision to reverse the long-standing protocol was based in two reasons — a significant decrease in the requests by freshmen women for single-sex housing and an increase in requests by all freshmen for spots in high-rise dorms.Less than 300 incoming women requested single-sex housing, while almost half of freshmen requested a spot in Creswell or Russell. In addition to keeping longstanding single-sex dorm Church, UGA Housing converted Hill Community dorms Mell and Lipscomb to single-sex freshman housing. With space for nearly 500 students between them, the three halls should be more than adequate to meet single-sex demands.“We’re always in touch with, and keep track of, the data that supports freshman requests ... we’ve trended so far downward in the past few years that it didn’t make a lot of sense to hold a 900-bed residence hall for less that 300 students,” Kowalski said. “We wanted to be able to meet student preferences ... when we made three floors of Brumby male, the requests for Brumby went up to the same level or even higher as the other two.”While there have always been more women than men attending the University, a roughly 60 percent to 40 percent ratio, the dorms have generally been created to accommodate both sexes. Very few adjustments were required in Brumby to suit the incoming male population.One major change was raising the Brumby showerheads above their previous 5-foot height, a longtime request by the taller members of the Brumby community. This change should allow young men to shower without breaking their backs — though some believe it should have changed a long time ago.“Why didn’t the shower heads get raised 30 years ago? It’s about time,” former Brumby resident Liza Gershen, a senior from Charlotte, N.C. majoring in social work, said. “Some girls are just as tall, if not taller, than some boys. Girls are not five feet tall. The shower heads were five feet tall.”The influx of young men caused some consternation with former Brumby residents. Some hope to see a fostering of goodwill between the residents, but others are more suspicious.“I’m wondering what boys are choosing to live in Brumby,” Gershen said. “Either they have never heard before that it was historically an all-girls dorm, or they know, and they are smart. Typically, Brumby is filled with sorority girls.”


 


That reputation for sorority life is one of the biggest points of trepidation for new residents, many of whom assume living in Brumby will mean being surrounded by girls intent on living the sorority lifestyle. However, UGA Housing is quick to assuage those concerns.“Like lots of other stereotypes or perspectives on campus, this one isn’t necessarily based in fact,” Kowalski said. “The women who register for rush are spread out all over campus ... when the activities are over, there’s a lot of women walking up the sidewalk.”It’s possible the visibility of the sorority groups is the main reason for Brumby’s reputation, but Kowalski said he doesn’t believe the majority of Brumby residents actually desire to join any Greek societies.“When you’ve got 1,000 women and 40 to 45 percent are participating in new member recruitment, there’s still 60 to 65 percent that aren’t ... the data indicates that it really isn’t a sorority hall,” Kowalski said.While there are plenty of changes on the way for the student housing community, the staff and support teams are well-prepared to accommodate the changing demands of the freshman community for many years to come.“The early reports from staff and students I’ve spoken to have been very positive,” Kowalski said. “It’s going to be a historic year.”",Colby Newton,variety,https://www.redandblack.com/variety/brumby-breaks-barriers-opens-doors-to-boys/article_83ff8006-0129-11e3-acc5-001a4bcf6878.html
12-Aug-13,Football notebook: Mark Richt is staying quiet on the status of Marshall Morgan,"Monday’s practice session – closed to members of the media – focused on special teams and was held in Sanford Stadium.As with the offensive and defensive lines, Richt sees kick return and punt return becoming roles that will involve several contributors instead of just one or two designated starters.“I think we got a lot to choose from. I’d say some of the guys are going to be starters on both sides of the ball, but I’m not sure who’s going to be the starters in some instances on defense, especially,” he said. “I don’t know if it’s going to be just one guy. I wouldn't be surprised to see more than one guy get reps as the season rolls along ... by design we might rotate them around a bit.”


 


As far as the most criticized specialist of the offseason is concerned, sophomore placekicker Marshall Morgan (arrested for boating under the influence in July) will not have the length or nature of a possible suspension revealed to the public until, well, Aug. 31.“Any announcement on Marshall Morgan is going to be halftime of the [Clemson] game,” Richt said. “By halftime you should know what’s up.”Nine Bulldogs listed as 'out'The Bulldogs are getting healthier – or at least some of them.Monday’s practice report only listed nine Georgia football players as “out.” Even better for the team, head coach Mark Richt said that more should be ready in time for Wednesday’s team-wide scrimmage, which is the second of three to be held before this month’s heavily anticipated Clemson matchup.“There were so many that wouldn’t have practiced even Saturday, and there’s a lot of them that will be [practicing on Wednesday],” he said.With so many starting jobs still left to be won, especially on defense, the scrimmage represents an excellent chance for many Bulldogs to seize their moment. Georgia’s secondary, defensive line and offensive line in particular have several players fighting for top spots on the depth chart.“We’ll have a better idea on where we are [after the scrimmage],” Richt said. “Now it’s just a matter of who deserves to start and how much playing time have the other guys deserved. There’s a couple, if it were today, we might go 50-50 on the playing time and just observe in the game to decide who [should start].”


 


Senior quarterback Aaron Murray sees plenty of the competition firsthand, something which he says has made for a more intense fall camp than in seasons past when the starters have been more defined. He does not expect that to change for a few weeks, either.“At the receiving position, offensive line, running backs; everybody’s pushing themselves,” he said. “Some guys have definitely separated themselves a bit, but it’s still 20 days to go until the first game, so there’s still a lot more to be gained on and off the field to get guys ready to go and see who’s going to be starting game one.”Dantzler on becoming ‘a badass’Junior offensive guard Watts Dantzler finds himself in an interesting spot this fall.With a crowd of talented players returning on the offensive line, including all five of last year’s starters, he could have justifiably been frustrated at not taking a redshirt last season. He still may get one this year. But Dantzler’s focus has simply been fighting for a spot on the field this season after being hampered by an ankle sprain for a sizeable chunk of 2012.“I came into camp looking to earn playing time, earn a spot,” he said. “I don’t regret anything that’s happened to me. I’ve had two awesome years here at Georgia.”This year, however, Dantzler approaches his craft with a new mentality – a mindset he has adopted after being dealt some tough advice by a teammate’s father over the summer. The suggestion? Be a badass.“[David Andrews’] dad sat us down, said to write out our goals, what we wanted to accomplish this summer. I wrote out some goals, and he looked at me and goes ‘these are crap.’ He goes ‘your main goal is you need to become a badass. You need to become a badass this summer,’” Dantzler said.


TNCMS.AdManager.render({region: 'fixed-big-ad-bottom-asset', slot: 1, fold: ""below""});


“It kind of hurt, but then it was kind of motivation. It kind of made me look in the mirror to know I needed a good summer.”The Dalton native also knows he won’t need to land a starting spot to potentially see significant playing time on what is a fairly deep offensive line. The top seven or eight linemen could be used in a type of rotation – a tactic that offensive line coach Will Friend has used before – meaning that Dantzler has an even better shot at seeing the field.“I feel like I am in that group. Coach Friend hasn’t specifically said that, but as far as camp has gone I’ve rotated a good bit with the ones,” he said. “I think I’ve proved that I can be accountable. Hopefully if I do good Wednesday, it will earn his trust more and more and I’ll be in the rotating group.”Freshman tight end gaining confidenceOne of the many Bulldogs to miss practice time due to injury last week was second-string tight end Jay Rome, who is still nursing what has been called an ankle sprain. The talented sophomore out of Valdosta is not expected to be back on the field by Wednesday’s team-wide scrimmage, either.“I doubt [Rome] will go Wednesday, unfortunately. But that gives Jordan [Davis] a lot of reps,” Richt said.A true freshman, Davis committed to the Bulldogs as a consensus three-star prospect out of Thomson, Ga. The 6-foot-2, 232-pound tight end has seen a majority of the second-team reps in Rome’s absence, an opportunity that he says has helped him improve as a player through his first fall camp.“I’ve been getting a lot of reps with the twos. That’s what’s been allowing me to learn the plays a whole lot better and feel more confident about getting in the ball game,” Davis said.

Aaron Murray, who has spent plenty of time throwing to the tight ends during the early portions of Georgia’s practices, has seen the young tight end trending upward as he logs more practice time.“He’s definitely smoothed out a lot. He’s gained more confidence in his route-running ability, his understanding of the plays and defenses, because it’s hard coming in any freshman, any position,” Murray said. “There’s so much going on in your mind, you become so mechanical with your route-running and everything. Then once you continue to rep it more and more it becomes more fluid and second-nature.”With the Bulldogs expected to continue relying on formations that utilize two tight ends, Richt sees Davis contributing on offense even early in the season – especially if Rome’s ankle fails to heal quickly.“I don’t think we have any thoughts of redshirting [Davis] right now. I think we got to get him ready to play. The tight end is very important in our system. Two veterans and one hurt, obviously he’d be playing right now,” Richt said.For Davis, who says he has added about 10 pounds since spring practice, improvement has simply been physically adjusting to the size and speed of his college teammates.“Blocking, being physical with guys who are a lot bigger than me, like Jordan Jenkins, Ramik [Wilson]. Just being able to match those guys physically and showing improvements every day, getting better on my routes and catching the ball,” he said.",Alec Shirkey,sports,https://www.redandblack.com/sports/football-notebook-mark-richt-is-staying-quiet-on-the-status/article_e18b2206-03c3-11e3-a8b8-001a4bcf6878.html

13-Aug-13,Speedster Reggie Davis trying to avoid redshirt,"There are more questions surrounding Georgia’s offense than just who’s going to line up against Clemson on August 31.It’s now also a question of who’s the fastest player on the team.Before the start of summer camp on August 1, it was thought that either redshirt sophomore wide out Justin Scott-Wesley or sophomore running back Keith Marshall held the title, but there is a new name that’s joining the bunch.


 


Reggie Davis, a freshman out of Lincoln High School in Tallahassee, Fla., has impressed coaches and teammates with his blazing speed, and is seen amongst some as faster than both Scott-Wesley and Marshall.  “Oh man he can run, he’s fast,” freshman running back Brendan Douglas said. “We were running those 300s out there and he’s getting it now. He’s definitely a track guy and he’s showing it, he’s got some wheels out there.”Although the debate is yet to be settled, Davis is confident that he could win the race if it’s a little longer than a 40-yard dash.“I think I would in long distance, they get me in short distance like the 40, but if the 50 and 60 come along, I could probably get them,” Davis said.Davis ran track in high school for Lincoln, helping them to a 2012 State Championship in the 4x100 relay, and said he once ran a 10.4 in the 100-yard dash and a 20.2 in the 200.Despite Davis’ gifted speed, his first love is football, and he only took part in track to further his skills on the gridiron.“I did track in high school because it helps out with football and I’ve just been running track in high school and getting faster and I can just translate that to the field,” Davis said. “It helps me because I’m small so I need something to cover for that.”It seems that Davis’ decision to do track is in fact paying off, because before fall camp it was thought that Davis might have to redshirt this year to make the most of his college football experience.


 


That’s not really a question anymore.With returning receivers like Malcolm Mitchell, Chris Conley, Michael Bennett, Rantavious Wooten and Rhett McGowan, there wasn’t much room for incoming freshmen to see the field, but it’s something that Davis didn’t want to miss out on.“I feel real great about that because I didn’t want to redshirt so I just have to come out here, work hard, and show these coaches that I can play at this level and continue to get better,” Davis said.Davis has been working on the outside at the Z-receiver position, and is behind Mitchell and Conley at this point in camp. Davis doesn’t know when or what game he will see the field, but will continue to put in the work until his time comes.“Reggie, he’s really stepping out and I’m happy for him because he’s showing out right now. It’s good to see we got some guys that are willing to work,” freshman receiver Tramel Terry said.",Connor Smolensky,sports,https://www.redandblack.com/sports/speedster-reggie-davis-trying-to-avoid-redshirt/article_f8193d66-02b8-11e3-badd-001a4bcf6878.html
14-Aug-13,Shouting and crying: Sorority recruitment a sensory overload,"There is something about sorority recruitment that a girl can never understand until she actually goes through it. There are other aspects that she still won’t understand as she strolls down Milledge in her carefully chosen sundress.Or possibly, I just couldn’t understand because I distanced myself from Greek life until the last possible moment, a week before the fall recruitment deadline.Perhaps it’s just my demeanor, but the first practice I couldn’t understand was the constant yelling. Why would you think that yelling peppy chants at me would make me desire your company? It may be a premature assumption, but I can’t see how these “walk songs” gain any Potential New Member’s (affectionately known as PNMs) favor for a particular sorority. Until a sorority serenades me with the musical stylings of Tupac Shakur, I would prefer if everyone stuck to their “inside voices.”


 


When it came to round three, or “skit round,” as it is called by those in the know, there was another peculiarity that I observed: an odd fixation with the disturbingly popular television series, “The Bachelor.” At least half (if not more) of the six houses I went to made reference to the dreadful entertainment value of forced love. And while some were funnier than others, the general fascination with the show was a bit off-putting, at least when you’re a dedicated consumer of offbeat History Channel documentaries and crime comedies like myself. And just as every bachelorette reacts with anger or devastation to the news of her departure from the show, PNMs have equally dramatic reactions when they are cut. I can’t deny that tensions run high during rush, but seeing a girl bawling in public because a group of strangers dropped her is hard to have sympathy for.Toughen up. Not everyone has to like you, and it’s not the end of the world. Why would you want to be inducted into a group of girls who don’t want to be around you?But perhaps the final, most traumatizing moment of recruitment occurred at the not-so-bitter end. While standing on the lawn of Delta Zeta, bid card clenched in disbelief and a grin creeping across my face, one of my soon-to-be pledge sisters squealed with excitement about this discovery: Lily Pulitzer was none other than a sister of Delta Zeta.“I bet they give discounts to DZs!”And in that instant I saw the next few years of my life flash before my eyes – pink floral patterns and pearls galore. What have I done?Despite my initial reaction, it wasn’t long before my brief anxiety was relieved. I’m not sold on the idea of plastering my monogram all over everything I own, but I soon realized that those aren’t the things that really matter anyway.I don’t understand everything that goes into sorority life, but I don’t have to yet. One of the most wonderful parts of the journey is the learning I’ll get to do along the way. For now I’m quite content to put on a cheerful smile, wear some pink and green and embrace my newfound home on Milledge as a baby turtle.

14-Aug-13,Taste Test: home.made catering opens space for lunch,"On Monday, award-winning home.made catering opened its doors on Baxter Street for lunch.With a brand new, sit-in dining room, 1000 Faces Coffee and the promise of fresh food with a down-home twist, the people at home.made take their title seriously. The meal was somewhat reminiscent of a lunch your parents might have packed for you when you were little. If your parents were gourmet chefs, that is.While not everything that is available on the extensive catering menu is offered in the new location, the lunch menu is extensive enough to please those who elected the Southern food aficionados best food at Taste of Athens, as well as any lover of Southern cuisine, or even just cheese.


 


To sample the new restaurant’s fare on the day of its opening, I tried the Swanee bites and veggie muffaletta, which came with an assortment of pickled veggies and cheese straws.To start at the most basic level, the cheese straws are basically like gourmet Cheetos, only twice as addicting. I could fly through a bag of those very quickly, especially during finals, but the handful that came with the sandwich did well in that it didn’t overwhelm the muffaletta, and it really offset the vinegar of the pickled veggies.Would it be weird to say the sweet pickle chips were my favorite part of this meal?When I interviewed executive chef Mimi Maumus before the opening of her restaurant, she talked about how much she enjoyed pickling things. The care that goes into it shows even in something as simple as pickled okra, pickle chips and green beans. The green beans and okra were spicier than they were sweet — an eternal debate amongst fans of pickled anything — but my personal favorite was the sweet, yet still sour, pickle chips.“Swanee Bites” is probably a term some Southerners haven’t heard before, but one which they will immediately take a liking to as — you guessed it — they’re fried. And made entirely out of cheese.Two fried cheese straws sandwiching a dollop of pimiento cheese will either make your mouth water or send you running for the treadmill, all depending on your opinion of everything fried and cheesy, but I thought they were delicious and immediately wished I had ordered more than two.Maumus is a New Orleans native, so she is no stranger to the wonderful world of muffaletta: an enormous sandwich of meat, cheese and olive tapenade made popular by Italian immigrants in New Orleans. I got the vegetarian version, which swaps cucumbers for shaved prosciutto, but otherwise all the remaining ingredients are the same. Enjoyment of muffaletta all depends on how much you like or don’t like olives, as the olive tapenade is one of the strongest flavors in the sandwich, but I personally thought it was great. I had planned on eating half for lunch and the other half for dinner, but a few bites coerced me into consuming the entire thing in one sitting. No shame.If I have one regret about my trip to home.made catering’s new location, it’s that I didn’t try a dessert. There were chocolate chip cookies and a red velvet cake sitting on the front counter that kind of looked like the best thing I have ever seen, but I didn’t end up sampling any of the sweets. Maybe next time.


 


The only problem with home.made’s new space is that it perhaps doesn’t have the room to accommodate a bustling lunch crowd that might want to dine-in, but otherwise the food was superb and definitely worth a return visit.home.made catering is located at 1072 Baxter Street and is open Monday through Friday 11 a.m. to 3 p.m.","Chelsey Abercrombie

15-Aug-13,Football notebook: Georgia holds scrimmage under the lights,"The Georgia football team held its second scrimmage Wednesday night under the lights of Sanford Stadium in preparation for the team’s opener against Clemson Aug. 31 at 8 p.m. Georgia head coach Mark Richt was unimpressed with his team’s energy in its first scrimmage but saw a different mentality Wednesday.


 


 “I’m glad we went at night, it was good to play under the lights. We’ll go again for our practice game next Wednesday, dress rehearsal,” Richt said. “Since our first game is at night, I thought it would be a good idea. I’m glad I did it. I thought we had a lot more energy this scrimmage than we did last time.” Both the offensive and defensive No. 1 units won the day and got some work under circumstances that could be faced in week one. Other than scrimmaging the opposition's No. 2 units, the Bulldogs worked on their one-minute drills, third and longs, clock management and triple overtime situations. And the last drill may be an indication of how closely Richt thinks his team matches up against the Tigers.


 


 “We practiced a third overtime where both teams scored a touchdown, had to go for two, the No. 1 defense stopped the two-point conversion and then the No. 1 offense made the two-point conversion win the drill,” Richt said. With a heap of injuries already, Georgia will not have to worry about adding any more names to the injury report after the day’s scrimmage. “It was a good day, nobody was banged up today initially,” Richt said. “Sometimes the next day you hear of something, but today Ron [Courson] came to me and said everything looked good, so that was a blessing as well.” Georgia will hold another scrimmage on Wednesday of next week, and by that point, the depth chart should start to become solidified.


TNCMS.AdManager.render({region: 'fixed-big-ad-bottom-asset', slot: 1, fold: ""below""});


 “All the coaches are going to go home and grade it. We have the technology now to have the practice film shipped to our homes,” Richt said. “Some of the coaches will probably do it tonight, some will do it tomorrow, it will be maybe a day or two before we start trying to figure out, and it wont be exact until probably next Wednesday. I think Wednesday when we have the practice game, we’ll have a really good idea how we’ll line up.” Langley and Wiggins continue to impress For most of camp, media believed that sophomore cornerback Sheldon Dawson would occupy the No. 2 cornerback spot opposite of Damian Swann, but with the performance of two freshmen, that may not be the case. Brendan Langley and Shaq Wiggins have impressed coaches throughout summer camp, and continued their progress in Wednesday’s scrimmage.

Both Langley and Wiggins had an interception on the day, with Langley returning his for six. “I’d say they’re all still competing,” Richt said. “Swann is going to be in there but who the other starter will be, it’s just a matter of what happened in this scrimmage and what happens between now and next Wednesday probably.” Wiggins had been banged up with a right groin sprain for most of camp, and Richt believes that Langley has benefited from getting those extra reps. But one thing that can’t be differentiated between the two is their ball-hawking ability. 

“Those guys have very good ball skills. You have a bunch of corners that could be in position to make a play and just cant catch it,” Richt said. “They snatch the ball like a receiver, which is great. They are pretty confident kids for just coming out of high school.” Two potential starters still out with injury With Josh Harvey-Clemons serving a one game suspension for a marijuana related violation, neither safety position has been locked up heading into Clemson. Two people that most thought would occupy those spots have been suffering from nagging injuries and missed out on the team’s second scrimmage. 

Junior Corey Moore, who has been ailing from a right knee sprain, and freshman Tray Mathews, right shoulder sprain, have missed both scrimmages, and there is a concern that they may not be in game shape come Aug. 31. What did Richt have to say about it? Not much. “Yeah it’s big. We need to get them back. Hopefully soon,” he said. Unofficial, official stats 

Richt led his press conference with unofficial statistics from Wednesday’s scrimmage, highlighting the players who stood out.  Running backs: Brendan Douglas: seven carries for 50 yards. Keith Marshall: six carries for 39 yards. J.J. Green: 9 carries for 34 yards. Todd Gurley: five carries for 33 yards, 2 TDs. Quarterbacks: Aaron Murray: 14-of-18 for 173 yards, TD, INT. Hutson Mason: 9-of-19 for 107 yards, TD, INT. Brice Ramsey: 3-of-11 for 65 yards, 2 INTs. Christian LeMay: 1-of-5 for five yards. Receivers: Malcolm Mitchell: four catches for 58 yards. Arthur Lynch: four catches for 35 yards. Michael Erdman: three catches for 21 yards. Gurley: three catches for 72 yards. Blake Tibbs: two catches for 21 yards, TD. Douglas: two catches for 21 yards. Michael Bennett: one catch for eight yards, TD. 

Defense: Josh Harvey-Clemons: seven tackles, three pass breakups. Amarlo Herrera: five tackles, two pass breakups. T.J. Stripling: four tackles. Connor Norman: four tackles. Garrison Smith: four tackles, TFL. Reggie Carter: three tackles. Leonard Floyd: four tackles, TFL. Lucas Redd: three tackles, INT. Mike Thornton: three tackles. Toby Johnson: one sack, TFL. John Atkins: tackle for loss. Kennar Johnson: INT. Shaq Wiggins: INT.

16-Aug-13,Football notebook: Bobo talks about end of Austin Long's career,"The playing career of Austin Long has come to an unfortunate conclusion. A senior offensive lineman, Long’s time as a member of Georgia’s football team ended due to outstanding academic issues, according to an official release distributed Thursday night.


 


 “It’s a tough situation he’s going through,” offensive coordinator Mike Bobo said. “He worked extremely hard on the field to put himself in a position to be in the rotation. Got a chance to see him last night, just told him I’m thinking about him and I know it’s tough. You feel for the kid.” Long was a former four-star prospect that made 13 appearances as a reserve during the 2012 season, but multiple injuries – including season-ending back surgery as a freshman – hampered his career, and he never managed to crack the starting lineup with the Bulldogs. Redshirt sophomore Hunter Long, Austin’s younger brother, remains with the team and looks to fit in as a reserve offensive lineman for Georgia in 2013. “Hunter has shown some toughness. He’s battling there,” Bobo said. “He’s getting most of the reps at center and he’s improving every day and actually doing a good job.”


 


 Who starts on the D-line? Georgia’s looming battle with Clemson is now 16 days away, but exactly who will start on defense remains a largely unanswered question. This is especially the case if you are defensive line coach Chris Wilson. “We got a lot of unknowns. People don’t know yet because they haven’t played much. We’ve got some good young talent up there we just got to develop to keep pushing and improve these next 16 practices,” Wilson said. The Bulldog defensive line is just another group that has an interesting combination of newcomers (JUCO transfer Toby Johnson) and returnees that have yet to start at the college level (Sterling Bailey, Ray Drew).


TNCMS.AdManager.render({region: 'fixed-big-ad-bottom-asset', slot: 1, fold: ""below""});


 A natural solution to this problem would be what Georgia has done in the past: use a combination of players on the defensive line. But with Clemson’s up-tempo offense led by the speedy Tajh Boyd on deck, Wilson will either have to rely on his chosen starters or devise another way to slow down the Tigers during the season opener. “You got to have a plan as you study the tape and watch those guys. You got to have a plan going in on how you’re going to sub and your sub packages,” he said. At the very least, Georgia fans will know one of the team’s starting defensive linemen when it takes the field on Aug. 31 – not that many would have doubted it. “I’m not big into anointing guys, but Garrison Smith is kind of separating himself right now, as he should. He’s still got progress to make. But other than that, it’s a free-for-all right now.”

 Odds and ends: Burnette, Douglas, return men The coaching staff hasn’t made any final decision on who will be returning kicks and punts for the Bulldogs this season, but there are a number of players that could spend time at the position. “If you’re a good athlete, you’re going to be involved in the kicking game,” wide receivers coach Tony Ball said. “We got Todd [Gurley] coming back. We got Malcolm [Mitchell] back. I’d like to see if Keith [Marshall] can do it, also. He’s a speed guy, as well. We got some guys back there we need to take a look at and see who’s going to take ownership of it.” In January, senior offensive guard Chris Burnette underwent offseason surgery to repair a dislocated shoulder that he played through for most of last season. While the LaGrange, Ga. native said he felt fully recovered, Bobo plans to be cautious and says that it’s unlikely for Burnette to play 80 to 90 snaps in the season opener.

 “He’s been limited through the first 16 days. Talking to him today out there, you got to practice and you got to push yourself. That’s what we’re working for is for him playing the entire game, but we got some depth at the [offensive line], so if we need to spell him we can.” There were a number of standouts during Georgia’s team-wide scrimmage held on Wednesday night in Sanford Stadium, including Brendan Langley and Josh Harvey-Clemons. But one of the more under-the-radar performances again belonged to freshman tailback Brendan Douglas, who logged 50 yards on seven carries. “He’s still got a lot to learn as far as what he’s doing,” Bobo said. “He’s having to be told a lot from the sideline or a quarterback. When he did run the ball, he got positive yards. I don’t know what the number was [for] yards after contact, but I don’t recall him getting knocked back all night.”",Alec Shirkey,sports,https://www.redandblack.com/sports/football-notebook-bobo-talks-about-end-of-austin-long-s/article_01951a7c-067e-11e3-a1e1-0019bb30f31a.html
19-Aug-13,UGA Panhellenic Council one of 19 to win national award,"The University of Georgia Panhellenic Council can call itself one of the best in the nation after receiving an award to recognize its work from the previous academic school year.UGA Panhellenic is one of 33 universities recognized by the National Panhellenic Council, and one of 19 to win the College Panhellenic Achievement Award. NPC covers 26 national and international sororities on more than 600 college campuses.Claudia Shamp, the director of Greek Life, said she is elated the Panhellenic Council at UGA has acquired national recognition.


 


“I think that Panhellenic is an outstanding organization, and they have so many activities,” she said. “Panhellenic don’t do their work for the recognition, but it’s very nice when they are recognized.”The NPC has given awards of excellence and achievement to student-managed College Panhellenics for 50 years and receives many nominations each year, according to the NPC press release.The award acknowledges the council’s excellence in five of seven functions: recruitment, structure, communication with the NPC area adviser, judicial procedures, community impact and relations, programming and academics.Sam Nickerson, a junior consumer economics and consumer journalism major from Athens and a member of Phi Mu, said she believes UGA Panhellenic is deserving of the award.“I think the people that I know on Panhellenic have done an awesome job and have made, I think, sorority life fun for all of us,” she said. “They do a great job because it’s not only that, its community service and a lot of other aspects.”Shelby Lambert, a senior biology major from Woodstock and a member of Gamma Phi Beta, agrees the recognition is deserved. She said UGA Panhellenic as well as the girls in sororities works hard to reach high standards.“I would say Greek life here is pretty important. We do a lot with philanthropy and raise a lot of money and a lot of us have really high GPAs,” she said. “We all work really hard to wear our letters proudly. “Though UGA Panhellenic has been recognized regionally in the Southeastern Panhellenic Conference, the SEPC, this is the first national recognition received in recent years, Shamp said.


 


“This is by far one of the bigger awards because it’s a national recognition,” she said. “This is the first national recognition that I’m aware of in a very long time. We are obviously thrilled that our Panhellenic association had been recognized for their hard work.”",Taylor West,uganews,https://www.redandblack.com/uganews/greeklife/uga-panhellenic-council-one-of-to-win-national-award/article_451f9898-08f0-11e3-92c1-001a4bcf6878.html
19-Aug-13,"Monday night mania, Tuesday morning penance","My first class last Tuesday morning began at 12:30 p.m., and thank goodness for small miracles. But it was not enough.At 10:30 a.m. plus 12 minutes of snooze, I rolled out of bed. Disheveled. With a fuzzy tongue that stuck to the roof of my mouth and eyeballs that felt as though they were pulsing, expanding and receding, in their sockets. I took a shower, standing stock-still in the bathtub, shoulders slumped, letting the hot water course over my head. Then I toweled off, dressed and left for campus. First stop, Jittery Joe’s.


 


I had, of course, been out on the town the night before.Yes, on a Monday. Come out with us, they said. It’s the first week of school, they said. It’s sorority bid day.I went out with them, and it was a grave mistake.The benefits of going out on the town are well known to every college student. The libations flow, then the conversation, and all the rest takes care of itself. On weekdays, as bars seek desperately to coax in the drunk at the margin, there is the added benefit of very cheap drinks — dirt cheap, $1 liquor drinks cheap.Do not be fooled, fellow students. Going downtown on weekdays is not worth all the enticements, all the rum on Earth.For starters, on weekdays fewer people are downtown. That can be a good thing, if you are in for a relaxing craft beer at an establishment with just the right amount of light and shadow and mellow music at just the right volume. But for livelier occasions, it means you spend the bulk of the night with few people to talk to. Just you, a few buds and a few Buds.This, in turn, means you will drink more (remember, the bars are practically giving drinks away on these nights), and will soon be teetering dangerously on the edge of consciousness. On a Monday!In a considerable state of disequilibrium you opt for a change of scenery, and upon exiting the bar come to an awful realization: there may be very few college students out and about, but the same is not true for the boys in blue.


 


With no other revelers to use as camouflage, you are the sudden subject of police scrutiny. Your options here are several: You can either a). Float along to another bar, conversing with your friends in dulcet tones and doing your best Johnny Cash impressions (“I keep my eyes wide open all the time / … / I walk the line”) or b). Cut your losses, most likely after a panicked look at your watch — 1:30 a.m. so soon! — by hailing a taxi and pouring yourself in.Whew, that was a close one.When you finally make it home, you crash into bed. The bedsprings groan in protest. Your chinos are left in a pile on the floor, and you just remember to set your alarm before the lights go out. When you wake, you will spend the next half hour alternating between the snooze button and prayerful penance to the God you may or may not believe in.However you spend your morning, you will vow never to do such a foolish thing ever again. Until your friends come calling the next week.— Blake Seitz is a senior from Dallas majoring in political science and public administration & policy",Blake Seitz,views,https://www.redandblack.com/views/columns/monday-night-mania-tuesday-morning-penance/article_057c3b48-0845-11e3-a109-001a4bcf6878.html
22-Aug-13,Football notebook: Safety Connor Norman could be vital come Clemson,"Georgia’s secondary is young and hasn’t been healthy this preseason, but Connor Norman doesn’t fit in to either of those categories.The senior safety has been one of the defense’s most integral pieces this offseason. From teaching the incoming freshmen the playbook to studying every position of the secondary, Norman’s role has been label as “priceless” by defensive coordinator Todd Grantham.“The more you can do, the more value you have,” Grantham said. “In Connor’s case, he’s a guy that can play multiple things for us. That makes him invaluable. He’s done a great job, not only learning those positions, but helping other players in our secondary that have youth understand what they need to do to. I can’t tell you how valuable a guy like that is.”


 


Those are powerful words about a player that didn’t earn a scholarship until he was heading into his junior season. Georgia’s secondary coach Scott Lakatos said the strides Norman has made in his time as a Bulldog are unparalleled.“He works; he prepares himself,” Lakatos said. “Obviously he’s gotten stronger, quicker, faster, those things along the same time his knowledge of our packages has gotten better. His knowledge of what other teams do has gotten better, so he’s made himself into a better football player thanks to his work ethic.”Bobo backs Murray as first-team All-SECAaron Murray's selection as the preseason All-SEC First-Team quarterback came as a surprise to many who expected reigning Heisman Trophy winner Johnny Manziel or two-time defending national champion AJ McCarron earn the nod.The Bulldogs’ offensive coordinator Mike Bobo, who didn’t have a vote, thinks his signal-caller was the right choice.“If I was picking, that’s who I’d pick because I think he’s one of the best in the country,” he said.Though only a preseason award, the honor speaks volumes to the respect that coaches around the SEC have for the redshirt senior quarterback. Murray, who is entering his fourth-consecutive season at the helm of Georgia’s offense, is in a good position to set several conference records to add to his collection of Georgia and SEC accolades he’s already earned.Bobo said that his quarterback’s statistics and past performances solidify Murray as one of the most dynamic quarterback’s in the nation, though he readily admits most other coordinators surely have similar sentiments about their field generals.


 


“I’m sure everybody else thinks their quarterback’s just as good too,” Bobo said.Clemson’s similar secondary confusionGeorgia isn’t the only team with health issues in its secondary.The Bulldogs’ Aug. 31 opponent has suffered a few inconvenient setbacks that might give the Tigers’ defense a slightly different look than expected on opening night.“They lost a corner, two safeties. But they’ve got a corner coming back and a corner that was injured [last year],” Bobo said. “There is a little bit of uncertainty.Junior Garry Peters and senior Darius Robinson, both expected to start at cornerback, have missed time this preseason.As a result, Clemson — much like Georgia — will be relying heavily on youthful defensive backs early on in the season. One of those freshmen the Tigers’ had high hopes for was Mackensie Alexander, but he’s dealt with several nagging injuries this preseason, leaving Clemson head coach Dabo Swinney in doubt about Alexander’s availability this season, according to several reports.The confusion of Clemson’s player personnel isn’t the only unknown for Georgia’s offense. Mike Reed is entering his first year as the Tiger’s defensive back’s coach, and Bobo expects to see some things that haven’t showed up on tape.

“They’ve got a new DB coach,” Bobo said. “So, techniques could be a little different on how they’re teaching things. It’s the second year of [Clemson defensive coordinator Brent Venable’s] scheme over there, so maybe they’re adding new coverages, new wrinkles.”",Benjamin Wolk,sports,https://www.redandblack.com/sports/football-notebook-safety-connor-norman-could-be-vital-come-clemson/article_e830bc10-0b98-11e3-ab1c-0019bb30f31a.html
23-Aug-13,Football notebook: A hostile Death Valley looms for Georgia,"Clemson fans are notorious for creating a hostile environment on the Frank Howard Field at Memorial Stadium, and Georgia players can’t hear enough about it.“It’s going to crazy. We know it’s going to be crazy,” redshirt sophomore wide receiver Justin Scott-Wesley said. “So many stories from so many people about how crazy it’s going to be so I anticipate it to be a great hostile atmosphere. I expect it to be a good game.”For those players that were around in 2011, the atmosphere surrounding a big season opener will come as no surprise.


 


Two years ago the Bulldogs faced then-No. 5 Boise State in a neutral site game, at the Georgia Dome in Atlanta, where the Broncos routed them by a score of 35-21.Although hoping for a different outcome, junior wide-out Malcolm Mitchell can already sense some similarities between the two games.“I guess you can say that. I think this game is a lot bigger. I mean I was just a freshman than maybe I just can’t give a good comparison but that game was big, this game will be big,” he said.The Boise State game was Mitchell’s first contest, and this year’s freshmen will be up against the same task as Mitchell, but perhaps in an even bigger game.For players that have never performed on this big of a stage, there is some question whether they will be able to handle it or not.Georgia head coach Mark Richt plans on talking to his freshmen this week and giving them a few pointers on how to handle the Clemson atmosphere.“I think you got to educate them that it’s a 60-minute game, there’s a lot of snaps, a lot of battles,” Richt said. “If you don’t win some battles early on you can’t go in the tank. You just gotta keep fighting, keep believing. You’ll make your share of plays but you know coach Grantham says it a lot on defense, you gotta play the next play. You gotta be ready to play the next play, good or bad, you gotta play the next play. You gotta get your focus on what’s next, and I think it’s easier said than done.”Benefits of playing under the lights


 


It’s been a mild summer weather-wise in Athens, and the Georgia player’s bodies’ aren’t used to competing in the sweltering Georgia heat.That fact was evident in Friday’s practice.“That was practice 23 and it was the second day in a row that it was actually hot,” Richt said. “I think the weather affected them, the heat and humidity, but they fought through it and had a pretty good practice. It affected them in that you could tell, it does something to your body when you’re practicing in the cool all the time and then all of a sudden it gets hot and humid like that. I was really proud of the way they pushed through today.”With that being said, it could be a blessing in disguise that the Bulldogs are set to play at 8 p.m. come Aug. 31.In fact, Richt said that he would be “very concerned” if the game were to be held during the day, and that he has seen the effects that heat can have on players.“If you don’t practice in it and you play in it, and you got guys wanting to win real bad, I remember one time, it was way back,” Richt said. “When I was at Florida State we played Miami at high noon in Miami for whatever reason, noon, or one o’clock kick-off. I mean that’s a bitter rival game and everybody was laying it on the line and by the end of the game we’re grabbing anybody we could on the bench.”“We were grabbing running backs to play receiver. Both teams ran out of IVs and they were calling ambulances in to bring IVs to guys. It can get scary. It’s tough on the fans too. The fans are used to being in the heat like that. It’s probably a blessing.”Tray Matthews alert

With his early enrollment last spring, freshman safety Tray Matthews created a lot of buzz around Georgia football. Fast forward a few months and he is still making a lot of noise — even though he hasn’t seen the field.Throughout the duration of summer camp, Matthews has been sidelined with a right shoulder sprain and now a right hamstring injury.His status for Clemson is unknown, and it isn’t something that Richt usually likes to talk about.However, he may have slipped up on Friday.“We hope he is healthy enough to play, we think there will be a good chance of that. How much practice time prior to that, I don’t know what he’s going to get so it will be hard to say what his role is going to be,” Richt said.After stating that there is a “good chance” that he will play, he slowly backtracked.“I said ‘we’re hoping’. I think we said we’re hoping,” Richt said.Some information that was also unknown was the fact that Matthews had been impressing coaches on special teams as well as safety. But without the reps in practice, there may not be a spot for him if he is to play at Clemson.

“I know he was factoring in pretty big on our specials too and if you don’t get reps on specials, especially as a freshman, that’s the biggest thing,” Richt said. “If he was a veteran and we thought he could be 100 percent byThursday we probably wouldn’t be having this discussion right now. When you’re just young and have a lot to learn it’s hard to get ready to play”",Connor Smolensky,sports,https://www.redandblack.com/sports/football-notebook-a-hostile-death-valley-looms-for-georgia/article_2a7d3a4e-0c61-11e3-b584-001a4bcf6878.html
26-Aug-13,College as an introvert: Freshman takes on Ramsey,"Like most incoming freshman this year, I was eager for the fresh start college offered me. I don’t think anyone walks in saying, “Yeah, as long as these next four years are just like high school, I’ll be golden.”So there I was, lugging suitcases full of twin-XL sheets and a secret stash of fuzzy socks up the stairs of a dorm that failed to mention that it lacked an elevator. Nonetheless, after releasing a deep sigh of exhaustion, I sat atop the glorious linoleum floor and gawked at what would be home for the next year.Terror instantly filled me. 


 


I’m afraid I’m the type of person that doesn’t confront my fears until they smack me in the face. It wasn’t the looming threat of failing a class or the distant echo of a raging frat party that shook me, but rather the prospect of being completely alone, yet completely immersed in a population of 30,000.Still, I retained hope. One person is bound to like me, right? I’ll just have to play it cool — which leads me to my first anecdote. My first night at UGA, I crouched over my desk, plotting ways to meet new people. I highlighted popular college spots and cross-referenced them with dining commons nearby.Now that I think about it, it probably was not a good idea to bring that map along with me when trying to socialize.Anyway, my first stop was Ramsey — a place full of other people like me just trying to stay in shape. The next morning, sporting my UGA Class of 2017 T-shirt, I hopped on a bus over to Ramsey. I strode in, confident that I would meet someone who shared my interest in exercise, yet a similar terror of any sport with a ball. I hopped atop a treadmill and looked around, scanning the room for another person my age. Unfortunately the room was mainly filled with people of the geriatric persuasion — in freakishly good shape, I might add.I punched in my workout and started sprinting — on an incline. I should take a moment to clarify. I’m not exactly the graceful, charmed kind of person; I fit more into the stupidly clumsy category. So it is not a surprise to find out that while running on the treadmill, my feet betrayed me and slipped out from underneath. I didn’t just trip; my legs sailed behind me as my arms flailed, trying to grab hold of the safety bars.In the process, I bloodied up my elbow, thus forcing me to go to the manager, explain the mortifying situation and bow my head in shame as she chuckled and handed me a Band-Aid.Now, as a particularly shy person, I embarrass rather easily, and this incident did enough damage to hinder my confidence in social interaction for a good 10 years. Unfortunately, in addition to being shy, I am also incredibly stubborn. I refuse to let things get in my way, even if the thought of socializing makes my mouth dry and palms sweaty.But then I had an idea (famous last words): I decided to use my story as an icebreaker. When meeting new people, you go through the cycle of “Where are you living? What’s your major? Where are you from?” more quickly than you would think. After it ran its course, I would just blurt out, “I tripped on a treadmill!” Thankfully, the person would typically laugh, which was at least slightly reassuring.


 


Although I may not exactly be the epitome of a social butterfly, I have learned that you can do a lot by telling an embarrassing story. Nothing too extreme, just along the lines of “One time I went to a club meeting and it took me the entire hour to figure out it was the wrong club.”People relate to embarrassing stories because we have all been there. Granted, I’m the only person thus far to regularly trip on exercise equipment, but it’s important to keep in mind that everyone here is anxious to some extent about meeting new people. Why not loosen them up with a humorous story?— Courtney Willett is a freshman from Marietta majoring in biological sciences and English",Courtney Willett,views,https://www.redandblack.com/views/columns/college-as-an-introvert-freshman-takes-on-ramsey/article_6649ddd6-0dea-11e3-83be-001a4bcf6878.html
29-Aug-13,Out-of-state students: 'absolutely frustrating' that HOPE taken for granted,"In addition to providing tuition for Georgia’s students, the Helping Outstanding Pupils Educationally Scholarship Program, commonly known as the HOPE Scholarship, seems to be the state’s top source of anxiety.But the anxiety can be hard for certain out-of-state students to understand.“It’s absolutely frustrating. But that’s what [in-state students] have gotten used to,” said Nikki Hero, a sophomore business major from Charlotte, N.C. “You expect that. I’d never expect that. We don’t even have that kind of opportunity in our own states.”


 


Many states don’t. North Carolina, for instance, does not offer a large, merit-based scholarship fund akin to HOPE.But that doesn’t make the anxiety any less real for students such as Alyson Fleet, a senior psychology major from Marietta.“While it’s hard to complain about free tuition, it’s still frustrating that it’s less free than it used to be,” Fleet said.The Board of Regents of the University System of Georgia raised tuition and fees at UGA 5 percent for the fall 2014 semester, equal to the hike they made in 2012 for this fall semester. In the last 10 years, the cost of tuition and fees has risen from $4,078 in the 2003 to 2004 school year to $10,262 in the 2013 to 2014 school year.In addition to the $1,117 in mandatory student fees, students at UGA with the HOPE Scholarship will pay an additional $737.10 in tuition fees not covered by HOPE because of changes made in 2011.Those changes, passed by the Georgia General Assembly and signed by Gov. Nathan Deal, established a tiered system of awards. The newly-established Zell Miller Scholarship, which requires a 3.7 high school GPA and a 3.3 college GPA, covers all tuition — though it does not cover student fees. The HOPE Scholarship, mandating a 3.3 high school GPA and 3.0 college GPA.“It’s really unfortunate that [costs] keep increasing. However, compared to many of my friends paying out-of-state tuitions, I still think [HOPE-assisted] tuition is reasonable,” said Rett Evans, a junior business major from Atlanta.About 17 percent of UGA students are from out of state, according to the the 2012 UGA Fact Book.


 


While all states bordering Georgia, with the exception of Alabama, have a state lottery used to fund education, only Florida and Tennessee have a scholarship program comparable to Georgia’s.“I think a lot more [Florida] students would go out-of-state to places like UGA if [the aid] could be used elsewhere,” said Bridget Bambenek, a senior accounting major from Florida.She drew a comparison between HOPE and Florida Bright Futures, a lottery-funded program with a tiered system of awards similar to HOPE and the Zell Miller Scholarship.However, while the basic HOPE Scholarship covers about 64 percent of UGA’s $10,262 in-state tuition at a rate of $218.46 per credit hour, Florida Bright Futures covers $103 per credit hour. That is nearly 50 percent of the University of Florida’s in-state cost of tuition and fees of $6,270.“I understand why states don’t give HOPE money to out-of-staters,” said John Michael Hailey, a recently graduated economics student from Memphis, Tenn. “As an economics major, I understand some things have to be cut. And that’s that.”Hailey explained how Tennessee’s HOPE Scholarship, which began in 2004, was modeled after Georgia’s HOPE.Tennessee requires a 3.0 high school GPA from in-state students, as Georgia did until 2011.Tennessee’s HOPE scholarship awards about 54 percent of the University of Tennessee’s $11,194 in-state tuition and fees. The state does not have a lottery-funded scholarship that covers all tuition akin to Georgia’s Zell Miller Scholarship.

Georgia’s HOPE Scholarship Program granted awards to 1,060,618 students at a cost of $2.3 billion from 2004 to 2009, while Tennessee’s HOPE program assisted 236,006 students with $836,592,840 in the same time period. During that same five-year span, 747,813 students received $1,731,181,046 from Florida Bright Futures.“It’s incredibly easy for Georgia students to get aid and I feel that it’s taken for granted by a lot of people,” Bambenek said.In his 2013 State of the State address, Deal said HOPE “remains one of the most generous state run scholarship programs in the nation. It is also keeping our best and brightest students in Georgia.”",Chet Martin,uganews,https://www.redandblack.com/uganews/out-of-state-students-absolutely-frustrating-that-hope-taken-for/article_8b3935dc-1034-11e3-8d54-001a4bcf6878.html
29-Aug-13,UGA prepares for Death Valley by pumping in crowd noise,"As the fifth-ranked Bulldogs begin their final bout of preparation for Saturday’s mammoth matchup against No. 8 Clemson, there are still a number of unknowns that linger on the edges of the team’s makeup.A thin secondary, an untested defense and the still-possible Marshall Morgan suspension are all question marks.But one thing Georgia can certainly count on in Death Valley is noise – and plenty of it. On Wednesday, the coaching staff had its players prepare for that setting by practicing in a simulated game day environment.


 


“We did do a lot of crowd noise,” head coach Mark Richt said. “We’ll do it again tomorrow in the stadium next time, crank up the noise even louder [and] just try to get used to it. Good news is [Aaron] Murray’s been through a lot of games like that, had to communicate that way. Most of our offensive players have lived through it, so it shouldn’t come as too much of a shock.”Of course, no amount of noise could ever perfectly re-create a college football game-time atmosphere, and especially one between two top-10 teams.For players such as Murray or center David Andrews, this is a non-issue: both have dealt with this type of spotlight before and have emerged victorious in several of those situations. In contrast, standout true freshman Tray Matthews, who is expected to get the nod at free safety this weekend, could be faced with a real baptism by fire at the hands of the Tigers.Complicating matters have been a couple of nagging injuries – a hamstring and a shoulder – have kept Matthews limited for much of the preseason. And though the team still expects him to play, Richt noted that his young defender could have a tough time adjusting to the speed of the game.“The hardest part about that is the tempo that we’re going right now,” he said. “It isn’t a real good indicator of how he can run out, how he can burst full speed, how long he can do that, can he do it for an entire ball game. That’s just the part that’s just difficult to gauge right now. We just don’t want to test it.”Matthews won’t be the only player to see his first college action in Death Valley, either.Freshman tailback J.J. Green, who followed up an impressive spring performance by famously jumping over a pile of players during fall camp, was officially acknowledged as the No. 3 ball-carrier behind Todd Gurley and Keith Marshall.“I think at least three backs will get into the game,” Richt said. “J.J. [Green] is the No. 3. The other two guys that have been pushing were [A.J.] Turman and [Brendan] Douglas, and they’ve been hurt.”


 


Douglas and Turman, it should be noted, are expected to return to practice on Monday.As for another freshman who turned heads this preseason, wide receiver Reggie Davis has apparently fought his way through a crowded field at the wide receiver position to avoid a scout team designation. The 6-foot, 159-pound speedster from Tallahassee could even earn some surprise game snaps in the season opener.“I think Reggie will play,” Richt said. “I don’t know how much, but he’s been practicing with the offense, which means you’re at least in the thought process of getting into a game.”The Bulldogs will need every bit of speed they can get, too, if they hope to keep up with a Clemson offense that head coach Dabo Swinney has said he is aiming to run about 82 plays per game this season.“They’re as fast or faster than anybody we’ve played,” Richt said.The actual time of kickoff for Georgia-Clemson is set for 8:22 p.m. on Saturday – just two days away, for those counting.",Alec Shirkey,sports,https://www.redandblack.com/sports/uga-prepares-for-death-valley-by-pumping-in-crowd-noise/article_f7085e32-10ca-11e3-b083-0019bb30f31a.html
30-Aug-13,Edges: Georgia at Clemson,"Offense:Two of the nation’s most dynamic offenses will be on display Saturday. On paper, not much separates the two. Clemson was No. 8 last season in total offense, while Georgia was No. 11. Clemson scored 41 points per game, while Georgia scored 37.8. Both teams have potential Heisman contenders lining up under center in Tajh Boyd and Aaron Murray. Each team’s receiving units bring back productive players. Georgia has more proven commodities at receiver, but Clemson has a bona fide superstar in Sammy Watkins. Both teams bring back experienced offensive lines. The big difference comes in the backfield. The combination of Todd Gurley and Keith Marshall is light-years more potent than Clemson’s Roderick McDowell and whoever else the Tigers decide to line up in the backfield. Although both teams will put up a lot of points and yards, UGA should have the superior ground game.Edge: Georgia


 


Defense:Each teams defense is considered a question mark this early in the season. Georgia’s defense is young, but believed to be more talented than Clemson’s. While Clemson’s defense has more experience,  it doesn’t have as much sheer talent as Georgia. It wouldn’t be far-fetched to assume each defense will allow more than 30 points. One thing that could swing the pendulum in Clemson’s favor is the environment. Death Valley will be rocking when Georgia has the ball, which could make it difficult for Georgia’s players to communicate. Since the two defenses are so evenly matched, the “12th man” could be a huge factor.Edge: ClemsonSpecial teams:Mark Richt still hasn’t given any indication whether or not placekicker Marshall Morgan will play. Even if he does play, Morgan was inconsistent at best on extra points last season, much to the chagrin to Georgia fans. Clemson’s Chandler Catanzaro’s claim to fame is hitting a 37-yard, game winning field goal as time expired in last season’ Chik-fil-A Bowl against LSU. Clemson’s consistency at kicker at the dynamism of return man Sammy Watkins points to it having the advantage in the special teams game.Edge: ClemsonCoaching:In the head coaching department, Georgia holds a distinct advantage over Clemson. Mark Richt is heading into his 13th season as head of Georgia’s program. During that time he has two SEC Championships and six Eastern Division Titles. Dabo Swinney is heading into his sixth season and has one ACC Championship. Swinney also never served as a coordinator. He was the wide receivers coach under former Clemson head man Tommy Bowden and was promoted to head coach after a successful stint as the interim coach. Swinney has been able to attract some of the countries best coordinators, however. Clemson has paid top dollar for offensive coordinator Chad Morris and defensive coordinator Brent Venables. However successful these hires have been – and they’ve been extremely successful, at least in Morris’s case – they cannot make up for the experience gap between Richt and Swinney.


 


Edge: Georgia",Cy Brown,sports,https://www.redandblack.com/sports/edges-georgia-at-clemson/article_44156b6a-10f4-11e3-b1bc-0019bb30f31a.html
31-Aug-13,Georgia/Clemson: First half rewind,"The first half of the high-profile Georgia-Clemson matchup was as advertised. After a pair of 3-and-outs from both sides, the offenses began to perform as expected with a couple of huge plays to get the scoring underway. Things got a little sloppy to end the half. Georgia quarterback Aaron Murray had two turnovers — a fumble and an interception — and Clemson's Sammy Watkins muffed a punt. Nonetheless, the two teams combined for 524 yards and 42 points with the two teams tied at 21 at the halfway point. The Bulldogs get the ball to start the second half.PLAYER OF THE HALFJustin Scott-Wesley


 


Georgia's redshirt sophomore wide receiver may not have had as many yards or touchdowns (one) as his Clemson counterpart Watkins, but Scott-Wesley has three catches (41 yards) that have changed the course of Georgia's offensive production. He had two critical third-down receptions on relatively inaccurate throws from Murray. Less noteworthy, he actually recovered a Watkins' muffed punt, though Murray threw an interception on the subsequent play. The statistics may not be jaw-dropping, but Murray is looking for Scott-Wesley on third down, and so far, the receiver isn't letting his quarterback down.PLAY OF THE HALFStephone Anthony's forced fumbleGeorgia's Todd Gurley and Clemson's Watkins certainly had the ""wow"" plays of the half, both accounting for 75-plus yard touchdowns. The most pivotal play of the first half, however, came from the Tigers' defense. Georgia led 21-14, and after two-straight scoring drives, looked to be getting into a rhythm. On third down in Georgia territory, Murray was blindsided by junior Clemson linebacker Stephone Anthony. The hit resulted in a Murray fumble, which was recovered by another Tiger linebacker, Spencer Shuey. The good field position paved the way for Clemson quarterback Tajh Boyd's 4-yard touchdown run, making the score what it is at halftime.INTERESTING STATClemson's three sacksAfter writing a feature this week on the depth and experience of the Bulldogs' offensive line, it was surprising to see Aaron Murray go down three times in the first half. Even more costly, two of those sacks came on third downs, which caused huge momentum shifts. Georgia has been rotating several linemen, and two of the sack came from two different linemen at left tackle (Kenarious Gates and Kolton Houston), so it will be interesting to see what offensive line coach Will Friend and offensive coordinator Mike Bobo choose to do in the second half.HALFTIME STATS

3-Sep-13,UGA President Jere Morehead institutes new need-based scholarship,"University of Georgia President Jere Morehead is establishing a new need-based scholarship fund in honor of his parents.The Wade and Virginia Morehead Scholarship Fund is designed to help undergraduate students study in the nation's capital as participants in the UGA Washington Semester Program. The program sends students to Washington to intern with legislators, government agencies, and different businesses.According to a press release, with more than 7,000 UGA students qualifying for the Pell Grant, a U.S. Department of Education aid given to low-income students, Morehead said one of his priorities is to raise support for need-based scholarships.


 


The first gift of $25,000 funded the scholarship, and other gifts will help the this scholarship fund reach $100,000 within the next five years. Students will be selected for the scholarship based on financial need at the discretion of the program coordinator. Scholarship awards will vary from $1,000 to $2,000, and students chosen will be known as Morehead Scholars.",Kendall Trammell,uganews,https://www.redandblack.com/uganews/administration/uga-president-jere-morehead-institutes-new-need-based-scholarship/article_d710bcae-149a-11e3-a852-001a4bcf6878.html
4-Sep-13,Environmental Health Science head honored with Athletic Association endowed professorship,"The Board of Regents approved Jia-Sheng Wang, the Environmental Health Science department head, as the inaugural University of Georgia Athletic Association Professor in Public Health.“When our college’s dean wanted to nominate me to be the Athletic Association Professor, I was appreciative of that,” Wang said. “The UGA Athletic Association, they really support academics. I didn’t see any other university [athletic associations] create endowed professorships, like UGA. I think that’s a very good thing ... then I got approved by the Board of Regents and I’m really appreciative of those different layers of those University leaders.”The athletic association has established 21 out of 220 professorships at UGA, said Tom Jackson, the UGA vice president for public affairs. Jackson said an endowed professorship is a way to recognizing outstanding faculty members for their work at UGA, as well as to provide funds for their research.


 


“An endowed professorship is a faculty support fund that provides moneys from the revenue from a specific investment fund established for that purpose,” Jackson said. “These funds provide additional support for a professor’s teaching and research, including but not limited to salary supplements, equipment, research assistants, innovative classroom and research projects, professional activities and travel. Professorships allow UGA to attract and retain our best faculty members and support their work and are essential tools in drawing national and international academic leaders to the UGA faculty. Holding such a professorship is considered to be an honor in the academic world, and the university can use them to reward its best faculty or to recruit top professors from other institutions.”Jackson said that Wang’s particular professorship came with $250,000.Phillip Williams, the dean of the College of Public Health, nominated Wang for the endowment. He said he wanted to choose someone in the school who was respected by his peers.“It’s an honor for a person. I wanted to choose a person within the college who was respected by his peers and was one of the top performers in the college,” Williams said. “We felt [Wang] was that type of individual.”Wang came to UGA in the fall of 2008. On top of his administrative duties, Wang said he teaches four classes and gives guest lectures in others. He and his department have created six new courses within the EHS department. He said the most popular courses are EHSC 8210 Cancer Etiology and Prevention and EHSC 8250 Biomarkers. Wang also developed a PhD program last year and there are 10 students in the program.“Our PhD Program focuses on how environmental factors or toxicants in air, water, food and working environment influence human and animal health,” Wang said. “We use a lot of model organisms as well as human epidemiological studies.”Wang is also a Georgia Research Alliance Cancer Scientist. His research focuses on environmental toxins and their effects on human health, particularly cancer.“All my research activities are divided into two sides,” Wang said. “One side is how do environmental toxins, contaminants and pollutants affect human health. For many years, I’ve used many models, animal and human, for that. On the other side, I also use natural products to try to block those environmental toxins that cause cancer.”


 


Wang’s lab is located in the Paul D. Coverdell Center for Biomedical and Health Sciences. He said he has six active research grants and the Department of Defense Biomedical Research Projects has given him five grants worth $2.6 million throughout his career. He also said his lab has published about 30 papers in the past five years.Wang received his bachelor’s degree in preventive medicine and his medical degree at Shanghai First Medical College in Shanghai, China. After attending Boston University School of Medicine to receive his doctoral degree, Wang worked at John Hopkins University and Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center as a post-doctoral fellow and molecular toxicology professor, respectively, before becoming the EHS department head at UGA.Wang has been at UGA for five years and said it’s a good fit for him.“I like UGA because it is a leading institution in high education among public universities,” Wang said. “The general environment in Athens is much better than many peer universities. UGA has good resources, including excellent students.”",Mariana Viera,uganews,https://www.redandblack.com/uganews/campus/environmental-health-science-head-honored-with-athletic-association-endowed-professorship/article_8e62b282-151c-11e3-ae36-001a4bcf6878.html
4-Sep-13,"Steve Spurrier teleconference notebook: Spurrier talks run game, rivalry, injuries","Steve Spurrier, approaching his ninth year since being named the South Carolina head coach, knows where his teams’ strengths lie.“His style has changed quite a bit offensively, he’s a bigger believer in being big and physical and pounding the ball and having a quarterback that can run the ball,” Georgia head coach Mark Richt said about Spurrier in a teleconference Wednesday. “I just think he’s going to adapt to the personnel he has and the personnel he thinks he can recruit and that’s a sign of a wise coach.”Spurrier, the 1966 Heisman trophy winner with the University of Florida, was a throw-first quarterback who was able to use his athleticism when he needed, tallying more than 300 carries in his career. However, his offense now, despite mobile quarterback Connor Shaw, isn’t quite the same.


 


“What we do best probably is run the ball and try to hit a few passes here and there,” Spurrier said. “That’s sort of been our formula the last few years, to run more than we throw.”Spurrier knows how to utilize this. Last season when the Gamecocks played Georgia, the team it will see this week, quarterback Connor Shaw attempted just 10 passes, compared to 14 rushing attempts. Last week against North Carolina, a similar story unfolded.When Spurrier’s No. 6 Gamecocks play the No. 11 Bulldogs, he knows his team must once again establish the run game, although maybe not quite to the extent of last season’s contest against the Bulldogs.“I would think we’ve got to throw more than 10 this year,” Spurrier said. “I would think they’re going to get a bunch of guys up at the line of scrimmage this year.”Just as Richt said, Spurrier knows his personnel. Without running back Marcus Lattimore, Spurrier split his carries between Mike Davis and Brandon Wilds.“[Davis is] a good back,” Spurrier said. “I think he’s obviously stronger than last year, maybe a little bit quicker and faster. Last week when he broke that run down the sideline, we thought, ‘Well, it’s going to be a 25-, 30-yard run,’ and next thing we knew he outran a couple of those North Carolina defensive backs and one of them had a little bit of an angle on him. That was impressive.”Spurrier “doesn’t see” Georgia, South Carolina rivalryDuring Wednesday’s Southeastern teleconferences, Spurrier was pushed about his opinion on the Georgia-South Carolina rivalry, but the “Old Ball Coach” didn’t budge on his stance.


 


“I just don’t see it, the hatred between Georgia and South Carolina that there is between Georgia and Florida,” Spurrier said. “You’d probably have to ask their fans all that, but Georgia’s beaten us so many times, just recently we’ve been able to beat them a few times.”Spurrier cited Georgia’s many rivalries as one of the reasons the rivalry doesn’t stack up.“Georgia has so many rivals,” Spurrier said. “It’s difficult for them to have a big rivalry game every week. I think they’ve got as many as probably anybody in the country with Georgia Tech, Florida, Auburn, even Vanderbilt, they’ve got a little rivalry going with those guys now. You can only have so many.”Spurrier, maybe in his attempt to avoid providing the Georgia locker room with bulletin board material, even put his own team down.“We don’t have that many down here because we haven’t beaten that many people to have big rivalry type games,” Spurrier said.Spurrier talks Gamecocks injuriesThe most notable injury news from South Carolina going into this week was the injury to center Cody Waldrop that has had him on crutches and in a walking boot.“We’ll see how Cody Waldrop does later in the week,” Spurrier said. “He’s got a sprained foot that’s bothering him. Right now I’d say he’s questionable or doubtful something like that. We’ll see how he heals, maybe Thursday.”


TNCMS.AdManager.render({region: 'fixed-big-ad-bottom-asset', slot: 1, fold: ""below""});


If Waldrop is ruled out of Saturday’s contest, Clayton Stadnik will be his replacement.However, the team saw mostly positive injury news this week, including that on the hamstring injuries of wide receiver Bruce Ellington and tight end Rory “Busta” Anderson.“I think [Ellington is] full go. He’s pretty close to full go now. He’s been running well now in practice. Also, “Busta” Anderson should be able to play some this week. He was held out last week. It’ll be good to have both of those guys full speed.”",Cody Pace,sports,https://www.redandblack.com/sports/steve-spurrier-teleconference-notebook-spurrier-talks-run-game-rivalry-injuries/article_bdd4b10a-15d0-11e3-9515-0019bb30f31a.html
4-Sep-13,Mark Richt teleconference notebook: Richt addresses defensive woes,"Georgia head coach Mark Richt addressed the team’s tackling problems against Clemson during a Wednesday teleconference.“It’s concerning when you see people score a touchdown on a play that should have been a 10-yard gain,” Richt said. “Believe me, Clemson missed a bunch of tackles too but they won the game so you don’t see anybody talking about it, but its hard to take down Gurley and Keith Marshall. Good backs are going to break tackles, I don’t care how good of a tackler you are and you’ll see it at every level.”One of the factors in the teams’ struggles was the youth they were forced to play with because of injury and the Josh Harvey-Clemons suspension. The return of players in the secondary should alleviate some of the problems experienced on Saturday.


 


“Perimeter tackling is really important and that’s where we’re, quite frankly, the youngest,” Richt said. “We’ve matured some in one week’s time because we’ve gotten Corey Moore and Josh Harvey-Clemons back. Hopefully that will equate to better tackling by virtue of the fact that these guys have tackled in SEC games before where some of those guys, it was their first rodeo.”The multitude of injuries faced in Georgia’s secondary prior to the Clemson game greatly reduced the amount of tackling he and his coaching staff felt comfortable doing, Richt said.“You can scrimmage your own team some, but if you try to teach it at a tempo less than tackling, they probably don’t get enough experience at it,” Richt said. “The more you do it, the more you risk injury during camp and we were so depleted at the safety position through injuries and the suspension of Josh, we didn’t think we could go another day tackling the week prior to the preparation for Clemson.”Richt admitted that they backed off of tackling the week before Clemson, but also said the team has made strides this week with the return of Harvey-Clemons and Moore.“Now we’ve got everybody back and it’s been helpful,” Richt said. “We’ve been working hard, trying to correct mistakes from a week ago and I think we’ve made good progress, but we’ve got more time and more things we’ve got to get better at.”Richt on Shaw, Davis, ClowneySouth Carolina quarterback Connor Shaw accumulated 240 yards of total offense and three touchdowns against Georgia in last season’s game.The Bulldogs’ defense had no answer for he or the rest of the Gamecocks’ offense as they routed Georgia 35-7. Going into this Saturday, Richt and defensive coordinator Todd Grantham will be charged with trying to find a solution to the quarterback that shredded the Georgia defense less than a year ago.


 


“Connor is a tough football player,” Richt said “He’s a very unselfish football player. You can tell he’s about winning.”Richt addressed some of the concerns that are associated with Shaw, a quarterback that uses his feet just as well as his arm.“Very, very rare will he throw into coverage,” Richt said. “If he doesn’t like what he sees, he’ll take off and run the ball. He runs zone reads, he runs quarterback draws, he’s very physical for a guy who plays the quarterback position and he’s much faster than most people really understand… Great ball security, great leader, I have a lot of respect for him.”Paired with Shaw in the backfield this season will be Mike Davis, a back that had just three carries and four yards against the Bulldogs last season as he played backup behind Marcus Lattimore.Davis, who has a similar style to Lattimore, brings his own set of challenges.“[He’s a] very physical runner, got great balance,” Richt said. “Rarely will you see one guy take him down, usually it takes a group. He showed some good speed too on that long run, so we’ve got a lot of respect for him and know a lot about him going in. He’s playing just about you would have believed he would. He’s gotten a little stronger obviously being in the program a couple years, but he’s always been a pretty punishing runner.”Georgia will also have a 6-feet, 6-inch, 274 pound problem to deal with on the other side of the ball in defensive end Jadeveon Clowney.Richt took some criticism earlier this offseason for describing Clowney as “the best football player in the world.” Richt, although not quite as zealous, continued his praise of Clowney on Wednesday.


TNCMS.AdManager.render({region: 'fixed-big-ad-bottom-asset', slot: 1, fold: ""below""});


“He affects the game more than anybody I’ve seen in a long time,” Richt said. “Warren Sapp was a guy that I remember that you just couldn’t do anything with him. You could get your plan, but he was still going to blow things up because he was just that good.”Clowney took some criticism of his own after he appeared to take plays off during last week’s season opener against North Carolina, in which he did not record a sack and had just three tackles.“I think he plays so hard that he got tired,” Richt said. “There’s not doubt about it, he’s human, but you’ve got to play hard enough to get that tired. If you watch the film and watch how hard he was playing and gave the effort that he was giving, I think that anybody is going to be a little bit tired. I don’t think there’s anything wrong with his conditioning, I don’t think there’s anything wrong with his effort, the guy’s just human.”Richt won’t stop celebrationsGeorgia’s roster added injury to insult after a disappointing loss to Clemson Saturday when Malcolm Mitchell was diagnosed with a torn ACL—an injury sustained during a touchdown celebration that will end the receivers’ season.The injury to Mitchell, Georgia’s deep threat on the outside, has obvious repercussions to the team, not only against Clemson, but going forward through the season.“Obviously when you lose Malcolm Mitchell it hurts,” Richt said. “It hurt us in the ball game I’m sure as we had planned some things for Malcolm and he wasn’t there to be able to have them. It definitely puts a dent in our depth, [but] we’ve got other players who know that position and can make plays and we have confidence in them.”On Wednesday, Richt also addressed how the injury has affected Mitchell and how he has handled such devastating news.

“Instead of always focusing how it affects the team, we also want to know how it affects Malcolm too,” Richt said. “That kid has worked his tail off, he’s been a great bulldog, he’s been a great recruiter, he’s been a great student and representative of our program. It’s sad to see him go through it but I’ll say this: he’s had a very, very positive and mature attitude about it. He realizes it's part of life and part of the game some times. He’s looking forward to getting this thing done and rehabbing.”However, Richt acknowledged the oddity of the injury and said that he would not try to stop players from celebrating like that in the future.“It was crazy and…they’ve probably done it 1,000 times and it is a part of the exuberance after a big play and we encourage that,” Richt said. “We want to continue to do that and I’m not going to try to be the celebration police and let them celebrate how they choose to and hope and pray that we don’t have another freak accident.”",Cody Pace,sports,https://www.redandblack.com/sports/mark-richt-teleconference-notebook-richt-addresses-defensive-woes/article_ed23fcd0-15d1-11e3-a053-0019bb30f31a.html
5-Sep-13,Married lecturers discuss friends with benefits,"They’re not necessarily the benefits you might be thinking of. What people can gain from friendship and social networks was the theme of the first Ramsey Series lecture Thursday at the Georgia Museum of Art.“We did try to be a bit provocative with our title, and I should note — just in case you’re expecting something different — that we’re using it in an ultimately different way than it’s used in common usage in today’s popular culture,” said Troy Glover, a professor of recreation and leisure studies at the University of Waterloo in Ontario, Canada. “If you’re thinking we’re talking about friends who get certain benefits, then you’ve come to the wrong presentation.”Glover and Diana Parry, an associate professor of recreation and leisure studies from Waterloo, spoke about how the social capital people gain from friends and social networks can improve their health and well-being.


 


“For those who don’t know what social capital is, using a metaphor, I’ll describe it as an investment in social relationships is intended to lead to some form of return,” Glover said.Glover and Parry are married and much of their joint work gets discussed over their kitchen table, they said. That includes their view of social capital. Glover said he believes friendship is based on a return in a social investment. Parry, he said, thinks that approach de-values the friendship.Glover and Parry developed a model of friendship and social capital and applied it to several different studies — including cancer, infertility and mother support groups. They said there were three major types of social capital: expressive action or emotional support, instrumental action or acquiring valuable information and obstructive action or actions that do harm to the network.One of their examples was momstown.ca, a website designed to educate and support mothers.“We saw women looking to connect with each other often at times when it’s difficult to reach support from family members and other friends, and one of those times is at 2 a.m. when you’re up with a child who won’t fall asleep,” Parry said.One woman in the study told them a story about being up in the early hours of the morning with a crying baby.“She posted on the momstown website that she was struggling with this sleep training,” Parry said. “And she said instantaneously seven messages popped up saying, ‘Hang in there,’ ‘Thinking of you.’”This would be expressive action or emotional support.


 


“I had actually spent time with both Diana and Troy when I was on research leave last fall at the University of Waterloo,” said Corey Johnson, an associate professor of recreation and leisure studies at the University of Georgia and the organizer of the lecture. “And I just got to know their work well and really respected the work that they were doing. And given the overall health initiative that we have going on in the College of Education, I thought it would be appropriate to bring them to talk about this particular subject.”Denise Anderson, an associate professor and graduate coordinator in the department of parks, recreation and tourism management at Clemson University in South Carolina, said she brought three faculty members and two doctoral students to hear the lecture.“The topic was certainly of interest to us, but getting to hear [Parry and Glover] speak was probably the primary point of interest,” Anderson said. “I think that UGA and Clemson are so close that we need to do more together and opportunities like this allow for that.”C. J. McKenzie, a UGA senior recreation and leisure studies major from Grayson, said she found the lecture interesting.“I found that information about the mom stuff interesting, about how they can connect and how that friendship is built,” she said.There will be two more Ramsey lectures this year, one each hosted by the department of kinesiology and the College of Public Health, Johnson said.“In addition to building [the Ramsey Center] facility, the Ramsey family gave a significant amount of funds to the academic programs that were located in the Ramsey Center and at that time it included the department of health and health promotion and behavior, the department of kinesiology and the department of recreation and leisure studies,” Johnson said. “Now since then we’ve all sort of gone in different directions but we still have access to the endowment that supports the lecture series.”",Jeanette Kazmierczak,uganews,https://www.redandblack.com/uganews/science_health/married-lecturers-discuss-friends-with-benefits/article_c6b00e46-1675-11e3-bd2a-001a4bcf6878.html
5-Sep-13,"Music Notes: Sept. 5-8, Big acts for Gamecock invasion","This weekend welcomes in the new fall season in true Athens style. Many longstanding local bands and solo artists will play around downtown to begin the touring season how they should. Many artists can pay tribute to Athens as their place of beginnings or honorary hometown, and this weekend will only propel the legend. Here are some shows to keep a look out for this weekend.Thursday, Sept. 5Harsh Words: Caledonia Lounge will put on a night of varied punk acts for $5 for those 21 years of age or older, and $7 for those 18-20 years old. Harsh Words will open the show at 9:30 p.m. The band is new, but its members are a mix of two other local bands — Gripe and Shaved Christ, which have been playing downtown for a couple of years. Another local group, The Fact, will follow. Little can be found about this band, so we'll leave its first impression up to the band. Then, the Portland, Ore. native band Juicy Karkass puts the hipster in hip-hop. Really, can that name get any better? Lastly, this punk quartet will be complete with Atlanta band Ganges Phalanges.


 


3 & 20: Hailing from Loganville, country band 3 & 20 plays the 40 Watt for $5 at 9 p.m. The nearby Georgia city also calls itself the home of Jordan Pruitt, who starred on the TV singing competition show “The Voice” and turned to country music after being eliminated. The band sites more historic influences than that of its city, though, such as Johnny Cash and Hank Williams Jr. Openers Crane, which claims almost every genre — country, rock, hip-hop and funk — and The Swank, which has Southern “grit,” add spice to the show.Randall Bramblett: An example of true Southern roots will show off a truly broad history of musicianship at Hendershot's Coffee Bar beginning at 8 p.m. for $12 in advance or $15 at the door. Bramblett, who has been based in Athens since early in his career, has worked with big names such as Gregg Allman, founder of The Allman Brothers, Steve Winwood and Widespread Panic, but he also makes music on his own. The show will include Australian guitarist Geoff Achison. The two have played together before to great acclaim. As a duo, they play off of each other to create blues and funk-inspired jam sessions.Friday, Sept. 6Moon Taxi: The fun and pop-inspired band Moon Taxi is back in Athens again for what seems like the 10th time in the last five months. The Georgia Theatre will host the band beginning at 8 p.m. for $17. It's from Nashville, Tenn., but apparently Moon Taxi can't get enough of us. If you haven't been already, the shows are always a hit, and this time it will include openers Black Taxi, a grit pop band, and locals The Barlettas, bringing back the ’60s.The Skipperdees: This local duo is climbing the Athens ladder. The two harmonic twin sisters play folk music on banjo and guitar. The show is at Hendershot's Coffee Bar, newly located in the Bottleworks area of Athens on Prince Avenue, beginning at 8 p.m. for free. Although the band often plays Hendershot's open mic nights, this show will give an intimate setting for the two to show off their intricate vocal harmonies.Corey Smith: The country rock guitarist will play at the Classic Center at 8 p.m. with two price point options, $25 or $30. Smith is considered a local although he only lived in Athens as a University of Georgia student. He has always been loyal to the city and his brand of country is one that always attracts old and new residents.Rivalry Music Festival: It's our very own, tiny version of Woodstock. A $40 admission fee, or $67 if you want VIP bar access, into Spring Valley Eco Farm gives you access to live music from 2 p.m. until 11 p.m. There will be national names, such as Wiz Khalifa and Major Lazer, as well as local stars, such as Reptar and the student band Colpoys and The Kids. It will be a day-long celebration of music to prepare for the game against the University of South Carolina on Saturday. What better way to spend the weekend than celebrating the two things most important to Athens?Saturday, Sept. 7


 


Roshambeaux: This rock band will play at The World Famous at 10 p.m. for $5. It's obvious the band has taken a few French classes. With its name being a play on the nickname for rock, paper, scissors, the band must be urging you to take a chance on its particularly dance-inspired version of rock.Ruby the Rabbitfoot: This local songstress will play at Caledonia Lounge at 9:30 p.m. for $3 for those 21 years old and up, and $5 for those 18 to 20 years old. I heard she made an impression at this year's South by Southwest music festival in Austin, Texas. The particularly sweet singer is a mainstay all over Athens, but those new to her music never seem to stop falling in love with her tinkering of folk music.Sunday, Sept. 8The Viking Progress: There are only two shows this Sunday. At The World Famous at 7:30 p.m. for $5, The Viking Progress, On the Water and McKendrick Bearden will play solo sets of folk-inspired songwriting.Back Alley Blues Band: At Ten Pins Tavern at 8 p.m. for free, the Back Alley Blues Band will play ... yep, you got it ... blues. It will be a jam session with some oldies.","Hilary Butschek

7-Sep-13,Better late than never: UGA seniors notch first win over Gamecocks,"It took Georgia head coach Mark Richt and this year’s senior class three years, but they finally did it.For the first time since 2009, the No. 11 Bulldogs (1-1, 1-0 SEC) were able to come out victorious against Steve Spurrier and the No. 6 Gamecocks (1-1, 0-1) in a 41-30 win Saturday night in Athens.“It feels great man. It brings joy to my heart. I hadn’t beat them since I been here and I haven’t played that much since I’ve been here against South Carolina,” senior defensive end Garrison Smith said. “To be able to play a whole game and play good against them, I’m just happy I contributed to the win.”


 


For the seniors on this year’s squad, the Gamecocks have been their kryptonite.There was the 2010, a 17-6 loss in Columbia, S.C., that served as the coming out party for former South Carolina running back Marcus Lattimore. He would rush for 182 yards and two touchdowns on 37 carries on the day.In 2011, former South Carolina defensive end scored Melvin Ingram scored a touchdown on a 68-yard fake punt and another on a fumble recovery. The Gamecocks took that one in Athens by a score of 45-42.And the South Carolina game that rests best in the memory of Georgia players and fans is last year’s contest that got out of hand quickly. By the end of the first quarter the Bulldogs were down 21-0 in a hostile Williams-Brice Stadium that kept rocking until the final scoreboard read 35-7 South Carolina.While these memories are some that Georgia players would like to forget, that’s the last thing Richt let them do: he used them as motivation.“Coach was telling us before the game that we hadn’t beat them in three years and they probably looking down on us and not even worried about the game like we are,” sophomore safety Josh Harvey-Clemons said. “I feel like we came out and fought and did what he had to do.”Richt implanted that mentality into his player’s minds, and they heard the message. This was not just another game for the Bulldogs.“For us we knew what was at stake obviously, second game of the season, South Carolina had beaten [us] every year since 2009 so we knew this was a big game that could be the ultimate deciding factor of our season,” senior tight end Arthur Lynch said.Last season the Bulldogs had the luxury of opening up against Buffalo, and earning an easy 45-23 victory. This season, Georgia wasn’t so lucky.Following a 38-35 loss to Clemson last week, the Bulldogs were not in the same position they were last year entering the South Carolina game.And they certainly didn’t want to repeat the performance.After getting down early to the Gamecocks last year, Richt knew that it was imperative for his team to have early success, and they did, winning the first quarter by a score of 10-3.“It just seems like if we get a little something going early, we’re going to have success that day,” Richt said. “If we struggle, everything begins to tighten down on you, you try to find the perfect call, try to make the perfect play. Every play becomes bigger and bigger because you haven’t gotten a first down in a while, but once you kind of break the ice a little bit, every one begins to relax and just play ball. Early success helped.”Georgia not only had early success in Saturday’s game, but also now has the luxury of controlling its own destiny to Atlanta for the Southeastern Conference Championship game.With early season losses to South Carolina the last three years, Georgia has had to rely on other teams to lose in order for them to take the SEC East—something that has luckily happened the past two years.It’s a position that Georgia senior quarterback Aaron Murray has not yet experienced, but he’s looking forward to some change.“It’s great it feels great to be ahead in the SEC East,” Murray said. “It’s tough for three years hoping they lose and that way we can get to Atlanta. It’s great to be 1-0 in the East, but it’s a long season and we have to keep grinding.”",Connor Smolensky,sports,https://www.redandblack.com/sports/football/better-late-than-never-uga-seniors-notch-first-win-over/article_70df5ab8-1836-11e3-9689-0019bb30f31a.html
8-Sep-13,UGA students to engage in naval battle at Ramsey,"Four players, four canoes, four buckets and one goal — to be the last boat floating.Battleship, the newest intramural sport coming to the University of Georgia this September, takes place in the recreational pool at the Ramsey Student Center for Physical Activities’ Gabrielsen Natatorium.A team of four will each be armed with a canoe and a bucket. The teams will use the buckets to fling water into other teams’ canoes, with the aim of causing the other team’s boat to sink. Players can’t use their buckets to remove the water from their own canoe, and if anyone falls out the team is disqualified.


 


The winner will be the last boat floating.Chelsea Johnson, a senior health and physical education major from Winchester, Ky., is an employee of UGA’s Department of Recreational Sports who had the chance to participate in a trial run of the new sport.“They told me that there was this new game that I’ve got to try,” Johnson said. “All they said was that I was going to have a lot of fun, and I did. It was so much fun.”Johnson is trying to form her own team for the first tournament on Sept. 15.The deadline to register is Sept. 10 at 5 p.m.Students can register at the Ramsey Cashier Window, either as a team or individually as a “free agent.” The registration fee for a team is $25.Jason James, the senior coordinator for intramural sports, said this tournament is a way to gauge student reactions to the new sport.“Usually with newer sports we start with a tournament and see what kind of turnout we get,” James said. “Then when we start getting more [participation], we can try to turn it into a league or something like that.”


 


James said that 15,000 students participate in intramural sports at UGA every year and around 35 sports are offered throughout the year.He hopes that 15 to 25 teams will come out for the tournament.Jennifer Stewart, the associate director for the department of recreational sports, said Battleship is this year’s newest addition to the list.“What we try to do in intramurals is add something new every year,” Stewart said. “Last year, we added inner tube water polo, which was a huge hit.”A total of 112 participants, making up 11 teams, came out last fall semester to try inner tube water polo.Stewart said that the idea for Battleship originated at the University of Alabama and that she hopes there will be a good student turnout at UGA.“It’s always exciting when a new thing does go over well the first time,” Stewart said.Trevor Ausburn, a senior science education major from Habersham County and an employee for UGA Rec Sports, also took part in the trial run. He said it was “a lot of fun” and that players don’t necessarily have to be “athletic” to be good at the game.

“Anybody can have fun doing it,” Ausburn said. “That’s what’s great about it.”A video of the trial run that Johnson and Ausburn took part in with other Ramsey student employees is posted on the Department of Recreational Sports website.Johnson expects a good turnout for the first tournament.“Once students realize how much fun Battleship is and how different it is from other intramural sports, I think we’re going to see a really good turnout,” Johnson said. “I think we’ll go from having just one tournament to having a whole season.”",Lauren McDonald,uganews,https://www.redandblack.com/uganews/campus/uga-students-to-engage-in-naval-battle-at-ramsey/article_2d99bf80-1720-11e3-b1a6-0019bb30f31a.html
9-Sep-13,SCOTUSblog panel probes problems surrounding judiciary journalism in digital era,"SCOTUSblog publisher Tom Goldstein said in a forum at the University of Georgia Monday that the “tipping point” behind a favorable turn in the blog’s long-standing campaign to receive Supreme Court press credentials was earning a Peabody Award last May.Supreme Court tradition demands news organizations earn a Senate press credential before receiving formal press access to the Supreme Court. In the months following the announcement of the award — an honor editor Amy Howe called a “wonderful validation” — the Senate press gallery granted Lyle Denniston, the blog’s chief on-the-ground reporter, this essential first step.“In the wake of the Peabody, it [being denied Senate press credentials] became kind of unsustainable, I think,” Goldstein said. “The Senate press gallery, which is essentially a private organization to which the credentialing decision has been essentially turned over, took us more seriously as an institution. And they were more willing to credential us.”


 


Seated at tables emblazoned with the words “Grady College,” with a pattern of Peabodys behind them, a collection of some of the most cited Supreme Court reporters in the United States spoke at the Richard B. Russell Library for Political Research and Studies.Veteran legal reporters Pete Williams of NBC News and Tony Mauro of the National Law Journal joined Goldstein and Howe to discuss the difficulties of Supreme Court reporting and what to expect in the upcoming term. Janet Murray, a digital media expert from the Georgia Institute of Technology, provided an academic perspective.The complexities of covering the highest court manifested colorfully, as panelists engaged in disagreements over court procedure and whether the Justices should move toward greater transparency.Howe and Williams diverged on the availability of audio recording of the summaries of opinions read from the bench.Murray broke from the rest of the panelists when she made the case that, though custom forbids electronic devices in the courtroom, only the complicity of the press corps prevents smuggling in miniature audio recording devices and cameras.“At this point we have new technologies, so let’s radically rethink — ‘what is the story?’” Murray said. “I’m making a prediction here that the force of a more pervasive media environment will overwhelm this set of really arcane prohibitions.”That issue emblematizes the mixed approach of the Supreme Court to its own coverage. The Justices maintain enough openness to allow journalists to fulfill their right to report, as set down in the document the court holds dear: the Constitution. Yet the justices remain remote enough from reporters to apolitically consider legal issues. They impose barriers to reporting — banning cellphones or laptops, forbidding audio or video recording, barring photographs — to stay sacrosanct.The Supreme Court limits personal contact with reporters to lunch once a year, Mauro said.


 


“This is how it’s done — you get a call from the public information office, and public information officer says, ‘you know, you wrote such and such, are you really sure that’s correct?’ And I’ll be reprimanded,"" Mauro said. ""And I know it’s coming from upstairs, from the justices.”In a world accustomed to the 24-hour news cycle and instantaneous updates on breaking news, the Supreme Court holds off on releasing the transcript of oral arguments until the end of the day.Until five or six years ago, observers of the court could not take notes. Howe said an effort by journalists to lobby the court to view orders 30 minutes earlier proved unsuccessful.Goldstein summarized the challenge the justices face succinctly.“The court has no actual power except the power to persuade, and one consequence of that is that there is great power to them in their oracle-like standing in our culture,” he said. “Aside from concerns about looks, I think the justices realize that in personalizing the court to themselves, in making it more about — ‘oh, it’s Justice Scalia over here and it’s Justice Ginsburg over here and it’s Justice Sotomayor over here, they detract from the sense in the nation that they are a group that objectively articulates the law.”Appearing oracle through oratory precludes cameras, Williams said.“Frankly, I have complicated views on television in the Supreme Court. Because I’ve sat there so often and thought, ‘oh, my heavens, if citizens could just see this. It is so inspiring to see.’ You would be so proud of this institution, the Supreme Court, if you could just see how really good oral argument is,” Williams said. “On the other hand, there’s value in a reflective moment.”The panelists agreed that Supreme Court reporters, unlike observers of other branches of government, have no interest in scoring scoops from insider sources.


TNCMS.AdManager.render({region: 'fixed-big-ad-bottom-asset', slot: 1, fold: ""below""});


“The costs are too high, the relationships of the press corps with the people inside the building are too thin, and there are too few agendas that would benefit rather than being harmed by leaking,” Goldstein said. “We do almost no enterprise reporting at all.”Rather, SCOTUSblog derives its Peabody award-winning value from interpreting legalese for laypersons interested in the high-stakes cases the Supreme Court routinely decides.All of the journalists on the panel exhibited that skill, often interpreting the more informed, esoteric questions for the rest of the audience.Unlike the congressional and White House press corps, who routinely rotate reporters to prevent an overly familiar relationship with politicians from fomenting, Goldstein and Howe, who have both argued cases before the Supreme Court, said that experience with legal issues is essential.Murray said in an email interview prior to the event that it may seem “disorienting to some” that new media should cover an institution of precedent and decorum, but insisted such an approach is demanded by possibilities of technology.“As I tell my students, good digital media design is not about bringing the latest bells and whistles to spice up the old legacy media formats. Good digital design starts by radically rethinking the core task — in this case what people need to understand about the workings of the Supreme Court.”Much like the Supreme Court, either through radical transformation or incremental steps, if Monday’s panel is illustrative, journalism about the third branch is changing.",Emily Kopp,uganews,https://www.redandblack.com/uganews/scotusblog-panel-probes-problems-surrounding-judiciary-journalism-in-digital-era/article_d35ecfb8-19ab-11e3-9fb8-001a4bcf6878.html
10-Sep-13,UGA defense grows up during goal-line stand against South Carolina,"It was no secret that Georgia’s defense appeared set to struggle during the early stages of the season.Eight new starters on the defensive side of the ball, including three true freshmen, means a learning curve is more than expected as untested players adjust to the speed of the college game.And the unit certainly took its lumps against Clemson, allowing 38 points and 467 yards of offense in a contest that didn’t feature many stops on the field. But on Saturday, the work-in-progress Bulldogs defense began to show some forward progress against South Carolina.


 


After a shaky start, Georgia would limit the Gamecocks to just six second-half points, forcing them to punt and fumble while also making a key fourth-and-goal stand with eight minutes left in the game. The defensive line in particular was able to generate pressure and force the issue at the point of attack on several plays.“I liked the fact that we played technically sound football. We could have done a little better with containing [Connor] Shaw, but we’ve done a little better than we have in the past,” said junior defensive end Ray Drew, who saw the field plenty in Sanford Stadium.A major part of that late-game success, said fellow defensive end Sterling Bailey, was Georgia’s ability to spell its starting defensive linemen with important contributors such as Toby Johnson and Josh Dawson.“I feel like the rotation really helped us out,” said Bailey, a redshirt sophomore from Gainesville. “As the game went on, the offensive line they just getting [more] tired and tired while we just kept rotating in fresh bodies.”In doing so, the Bulldogs were able to wear down a South Carolina offensive line that was on average much heavier than any defender that lined up on the other side of the ball. Offseason conditioning, a topic of discussion after a lackluster defensive effort in the season opener, was vital in the victory.“We knew what he was about. Even though they’re big guys, I believe we out-worked them,” Drew said. “Our strength and conditioning staff they made sure we did a lot of running over the summer and ever since January, the mat drills, the early morning running and all kinds of stuff, it was all leading up to that moment.”The moment of truth for the entire defense, however, would unquestionably become the team’s aforementioned fourth-down stop of a Mike Davis option play. It was the same play Davis had scored on just six minutes prior – but this time Georgia’s defense had it read perfectly.“It was a big fourth-down stop. Coming out there as a group we all got together and say, ‘hey, we going to get that stop,’” Bailey said. “It really was a boost for us after giving up so many yards and then just stopping them down there from getting a touchdown.”


 


The stuff was also nearly negated by a roughness penalty called on senior defensive end Garrison Smith (it would be a dead ball foul, much to Georgia’s delight). And though poorly timed, Smith made it clear that the play was only a product of his desire to keep the Gamecocks out of the end zone.“It don’t take a blind man to see that if you watch the play, I was on the ground and I see the pile still moving and I was just trying to get to the pile to stop the play,” Smith said. “I’m just being a hustle guy to try and stop the pile from moving, ‘cause you seen earlier in the game we was on the goal line, the guy scored because somebody pushed it into the end zone.”Regardless, the ultimate outcome was a positive one, and there were clear signs that Georgia’s defense began to find its footing along the way – especially in the case of Bailey, who recorded 10 tackles and one sack in just his second career start.“He’s doing a hell of a job. He’s playing really well. I’m proud of him. He’s getting better,” Smith said. “Just do your job and the plays happen. He’s playing the same thing I played last year and that’s just how it happens. When you do your job, the plays come to you ... It’s really working out for him right now.”With an open week on deck followed by what should be a tune-up game against North Texas, the Bulldogs will have time to recuperate and perhaps begin preparations for a looming home game against conference foe Louisiana State.The defense will have already emerged from a killer slate of back-to-back top-10 opponents intact and far more battle-seasoned for the offenses it will face on the remainder of this year’s schedule.“I think we’re making steps. Making progress. And we’re going to continue to get better,” Smith said. “The stuff we’re giving up is stuff we’re doing to ourselves. Once we stop all the self-inflicted wounds we’re going to be alright.”",Alec Shirkey,sports,https://www.redandblack.com/sports/uga-defense-grows-up-during-goal-line-stand-against-south/article_059b6af4-19ca-11e3-a3d8-001a4bcf6878.html
11-Sep-13,SGA Senators consider higher green fee at first required committee meeting,"Student Government Association senators, dressed down from their typical formal attire and without their engraved name tags, assembled for committee meetings for the first time this year Tuesday night, and began to roll up their sleeves.The collection of senators represented a considerably larger group than present at committee meetings two weeks ago. At the Senate meeting last Tuesday, executive members announced to elected academic senators and newly appointed “student life” senators alike that every member of the legislative body would be required to serve on at least one committee.Director of Legislative Affairs Alex Ballasiotes said in an announcement to the body that he recognized the “concerns” of senators about meeting four times a month, for senate twice and committee meetings twice, on alternating weeks. Ballasiotes said senators convening twice a month with “off weeks,” and not engaging in committee work were customs exclusive to the 2012 to 2013 SGA term.


 


Requiring senators to attend has changed the makeup of committees, but has also required an overhaul of committee structure.Policy board members will act as liaisons to their respective committees. Those committees will work with relevant student groups and strategize implementation — how to sell their ideas to the administration and other departments and offices.This way, committees will report to a certain “constituency,” Ballasiotes said.SGA Vice President Uzma Chowdhury described the new structure as, “kind of like Congress.”Tyler Faby serves as the policy board member to the sustainability committee.In the first meeting of the six member committee Tuesday night, Faby said the group might consider pushing for a higher green fee — which would be voted on by the student body on the Homecoming ballot — a campus-wide temperature standard, LEED certification of new buildings, more recycling bins and more green pilot programs.Pilot programs receive temporary funds, then are evaluated by the administration and budget office, which consider whether to introduce the programs as permanent policy. Faby said policy programs rarely survive this process, because “even when they’re successful, there’s not a lot of money for them.”The committee members fumbled at first on what to do, but adjourned by agreeing to read over and discuss Faby’s list of proposals.


 


Someone asked whether the delegation should adopt a mission statement.“Sustainability is sort of its own mission statement,” said Brett Weber, the committee chair.",Emily Kopp,uganews,https://www.redandblack.com/uganews/politics/sga-senators-consider-higher-green-fee-at-first-required-committee/article_4f4dc922-1afa-11e3-ada2-001a4bcf6878.html
12-Sep-13,Ratings system to potentially decide UGA students' federal aid fate,"Getting a pretty penny from the federal government may require more than before with President Barack Obama’s possible new ranking system. Obama called to tie federal financial aid to a new U.S. government rating of college costs and performance, according to an article from Bloomberg. The system would rank colleges against their peers, and students attending higher rated schools would receive more financial aid than others. “Colleges are not going to be able to just keep on increasing tuition year after year, and then passing it on to students and families and taxpayers,” Obama said to University of Buffalo students on August 22.


 


The ratings system would rank colleges against their peers, and criteria would be based on tuition, student debt, graduation rates and student earnings once they leave. Obama charged the Education Department to develop and put the ranking system in place before the 2015 school year.UGA will be compared to peer colleges, such as Ohio State University and University of Florida, as well as colleges in-state. Undergraduate in-state tuition for UGA in fiscal year 2012 was $4,014 per semester, according to the 2012 UGA Fact Book, but there are 20,705 students who took loans in the same year. Additionally, UGA's percentage of undergraduates holding debt equals 46 percent, but Georgia College and State University, Georgia State University and Georgia Southern University all have higher percentages by at least ten percent. The average debt of one UGA undergraduate student equals $18,569, according to the Project on Student Debt. The Office of Student Financial Aid declined The Red & Black's request for an interview because Obama's proposal is still subject to congressional approval, and no official federal aid change has occurred. Still, see how UGA stacks up against other schools in the state.

13-Sep-13,Committee seeks new executive director for Office of Legal Affairs,"University of Georgia President Jere Morehead assembled a committee of eight UGA faculty members to find a new executive director for the Office of Legal Affairs in a nation-wide search.Steve Shoemaker, former executive director, retired at the end of the previous academic year, and Beth Bailey, former associate director, has been serving in an interim capacity since July 1.“They hope to get a wide and diverse pool of candidates,” said Kathy Pharr, chief of staff for Morehead. “But I think they really want to see people who have institutional experience, serving institutional clients and preferably with higher education experience.”


 


Chaired by Bo Rutledge, an associate dean for faculty development and the Herman E. Talmadge Chair in the UGA School of Law, the remainder of the committee is comprised of: Kellie Casey, director of advocacy in the School of Law, Janyce Dawkins, director of the Equal Opportunity Office, Carla Williams, executive associate athletic director in the UGA Athletic Association, Barrett Malone, director for student conduct in the Office of Student Conduct, Duane Ritter, interim associate vice president of the Office of Human Resources, Matthew Whitley, director of the Internal Auditing Division and Jessica Orbock, senior legal adviser in the Office of the Vice President for Research and general counsel for University of Georgia Research Foundation.“The committee will be assisted by the UGA Search Group, headed by senior director Frank DiGiacomo in the Office of Human Resources,” according to a UGA Today news release.Candidates for the position will come to campus in early December to give presentations, meet with administrators and have a meeting with Morehead.“[Morehead] hopes to make his decision that month so that the person could be in place by Jan. 1,” Pharr said.“The executive director will lead a team of attorneys in the Office of Legal Affairs providing services which include legal advice, assistance, education and training to administrators, faculty, staff and students in the course of their work and activities on behalf of the University of Georgia,” according to the position description.Pharr said Morehead thought carefully before selecting the committee since the position being filled handles a large responsibility for UGA.“The on-campus interviews are going to be pivotal,” Pharr said.She mentioned that committee members are attorneys who interact with the Office of Legal Affairs regularly.

16-Sep-13,SGA to petition for tax-free textbook weekend to battle rising costs,"The Student Government Association will petition for a tax-free holiday for textbooks when the state legislature convenes next year, according to a senate resolution passed Sept. 3. But it may not have to.In Utah, students convinced the state tax commission textbook sales served the mission of higher education, and deserved the tax exemption accorded other nonprofits.The University of Georgia Libraries Acquisitions Department confirmed it does not pay sales tax on the books it secures for the library.


 


UGA students pay $70 a year in textbook taxes, said Jon Goodfriend, the SGA senator who authored the resolution. The UGA Office of Student Financial Aid’s website estimates $916 in book and supplies costs for the fall 2013 and spring 2014, and the state of Georgia imposes a sales tax, varying by county between six to eight percent sales tax, according to the Georgia sales tax rate chart effective July 1.According to the resolution, the proposed tax break amounts to less than half of the $150 textbook subsidy offered to students eligible for the Helping Outstanding Pupils Educationally Scholarship, HOPE, before it was nixed in 2011 reforms.The SGA resolution does not calculate the cost of the tax break.The University System of Georgia included 253,552 students in fall 2005, the latest estimate available through the USG By the Numbers database. With Goodfriend’s estimate, the $70 textbook tax reprieve would thus cost the state about $17.7 million in revenue. Full-time equivalent, FTE, students accounted for 218,617 students in the 2005 headcount, according to the database. Granting a tax holiday to only full-time students would divest $15.3 million from state coffers.Meanwhile, nationwide, rising textbook prices have outstripped inflation, claiming a larger and larger share of students’ budgets.A study by the American Enterprise Institution estimates textbook prices have spiked more than 800 percent since 1978, more than three times the average increase for all goods and services.Rising textbook prices have siphoned money from Athens bookstores to online sales, which could have repercussions on the local economy.“While some of the books may be purchased locally at bookstores, I suspect many are purchased through Amazon and other online tellers, and therefore represent almost a total loss to local economy,” said Jeffrey Humphreys, director of the Selig Center for Economic Growth in a previous Red & Black article.


 


“That’s a leakage of local spending power — it’s dollars that primarily leave the community. That tends to lower the whole area’s economic multiplier.”A total of 22 states, including some that house UGA peer institutions, grant some tax relief in textbook sales. To factor in the five states without any sales tax places Georgia in the 46 percent minority of states that levy textbook taxes.The state already designates a tax-free weekend for school supplies, but considers books — other than children’s books, thesauruses and dictionaries — ineligible for the three day reprieve.",Emily Kopp,uganews,https://www.redandblack.com/uganews/politics/sga-to-petition-for-tax-free-textbook-weekend-to-battle/article_f19d68a8-1e5c-11e3-93f6-001a4bcf6878.html
18-Sep-13,Line and Tackle: Defensive lineman Garrison Smith finds comfort in fishing,"Nose tackles never get the glory.It’s a part of the game Garrison Smith knows only too well. Though a defensive end in years past, the senior from Atlanta has taken up the big-bodied role of interior lineman for Georgia this season. He’s found early success in doing so, too – impressive when considering all that’s asked of a nose tackle in a 3-4 defensive scheme.But when it comes to his free time, Smith is focused on a different type of tackle altogether.


 


“I gotta go fishing. I love fishing. That’s my little hobby I like to do in my spare time. Just relax and fish and see what bite,” Smith said. “Sometimes it’s just good to get away for a minute. Don’t even have to think about football.”He’s not one to throw those fish back, either: turning the day’s catch into dinner is one of Smith’s favorite parts of the whole process.“Brim, catfish, bass, whatever's biting. I’ll pull it up out of there, clean it up. I got a video on Instagram, too, I’ll show you how to clean them fish,” he said. “[My friend] got a big pond in Milledgeville, so that’s where I go. Go fish in that pond and everything bite. And everything we catch, we clean and cook.”All that protein should do Smith plenty of good on the football field, as well, considering that his predecessor at nose tackle (John Jenkins) outweighed him by almost 50 pounds. Yet both have been asked to complete the thankless task of moving the pile in the thick of any given play.“It’s a big difference,” Smith said. “Basically at the nose you’re taking up more blocks and you’re not getting to make as many plays because you’re not really getting one-on-one’s. So it’s hard to make plays.”But the selfless nature of playing at the nose, namely taking on double-teams while Georgia’s other defenders are credited with stops, seems to suit Smith quite well.Through the early weeks of the fall, he says he has been content to embrace the role of quiet play-maker while teammates such as defensive end Sterling Bailey (10 tackles, one sack against South Carolina) and linebacker Amarlo Herrera (24 tackles on the season) have been able to thrive from a statistical standpoint.“Sterling’s playing what I played last year. So he’s making a lot of plays and he’s doing very good. I’m inside now so I’m taking up blocks for everybody. I’m just doing my part.” Smith said. “I’m not worried about no stats. I’m a team player.”


 


At the same time, Smith’s production and the value he creates for the entire unit certainly has not gone unnoticed by Georgia’s coaching staff. In many ways, Smith and his fellow linemen create the gaps that allow the linebackers to make plays and attain those tackling totals.“I think the guys up front have actually played pretty well and been pretty physical and stout. In the last game in particular I think those guys allowed Amarlo and Ramik [Wilson] to make those tackles,” defensive coordinator Todd Grantham said.And nose tackle isn’t even the only responsibility that has been added to Smith’s plate of duties this season.As one of the few battle-hardened veterans of the Southeastern Conference on Georgia’s defense, it has fallen primarily upon Smith to guide the younger Bulldogs through an unforgiving early-season schedule.“He brings a leadership to the defense being the only senior. He’s the one with game experience, and when it comes to needing a stop or something he’ll get us up and do a little battle cry,” Bailey said. “He be saying anything and everything.”“Garrison’s doing a great job for us up front just wherever we put him,” head coach Mark Richt said. “I think more than anything else, he’s shown up as a good leader. He’s been practicing hard every day and every play, and he’s kind of expecting that from his teammates. He’s stepped up in that role.”The part of teacher and mentor, too, Smith has been willing to accept with open arms – though being a leader in the locker room did not come without its share of difficulties for the easy-going lineman. He had to find his voice first.“It’s something I enjoy and embrace just because I’m an older guy and I can help these younger guys out,” Smith said. “But it’s definitely a challenge because a guy like me just being such a laid-back guy, just doing what I had to do, trying to lead by example, it’s kind of hard when I finally have to speak up. That’s not really my character to talk a lot. Just doing that, it’s challenging, but it’s something I enjoy because I want to help my team.”

Smith still has his senior year to finish, as well as a potential NFL career that has yet to begin. But perhaps fans will see Smith flash his fishing skills on television one day when all is said and done.“We going to start us a little T.V. show,” Smith said of he and his friend in Milledgeville. “The City-Country Boys, ‘cause I’m from the city and he’s from the country. It’s real fun when we get together, ‘cause a lot of people from the city like going fishing, hunting. It’s real fun being able to experience that.”He may not graduate this year with a boatload of statistical accomplishments under his belt, be they fishing or football-related. But Smith's presence as a key cog on the Bulldogs defense, both as a reliable player and one teammates can rally around, will surely be missed when his time in Athens does eventually come to a close.“Garrison’s the guy that when something’s not been done right, he’s going to go after that guy. He’s going to make sure you know what you’re doing wrong and how to correct it,” junior cornerback Damian Swann said. “He has a lot on his plate, but he’s taken that role really well and we appreciate what he does.”",Alec Shirkey,sports,https://www.redandblack.com/sports/line-and-tackle-defensive-lineman-garrison-smith-finds-comfort-in/article_0ba6abb4-20c5-11e3-a7b4-0019bb30f31a.html
19-Sep-13,Booster boundaries set around UGA football program,"Every school in the nation seems to have at least some dirty laundry when it comes to college athletics – or at least the ones with major football programs.Last year, Miami self-imposed a bowl ban for the second straight season in the wake of an NCAA investigation that centered around booster Nevin Shapiro providing over $2 million in improper benefits to various football players. Last week, Oklahoma State became the latest university alleged to have broken rules, per Sports Illustrated, part of which again involved boosters handing out anywhere from $200 to $800 to former Cowboys in the locker room after games. Even going back to 1986, when SMU football was handed the “death penalty,” the infractions stemmed from boosters funneling cash to their institution’s players.And yet perhaps the most stirring words on the state of the college game at Georgia and elsewhere sprang forth from the fingers of former defensive standout David Pollack over the weekend when he echoed exactly what has been claimed so many times: that schools such as Oklahoma State are but one of many.


 


That would include his Bulldogs.“Fans [you] don't want to know what goes on behind closed doors in CFB. Rules get bent & broken at EVERY SCHOOL! Boosters more than coaches,” Pollack tweeted on Saturday.Now an on-air analyst for ESPN, Pollack was a three-time All-American defensive end for Georgia from 2002-04, just the second player in team history to earn the honor three times after Herschel Walker. His 36 career sacks stand as a school record, and his highlight-reel interception against South Carolina in 2002 remains a cherished part of Bulldogs football lore.As a star player, Pollack’s comments would lead many to question whether he received improper benefits or witnessed rule violations firsthand while in college – especially with regards to the school’s boosters, which have played a common role in each of the aforementioned monetary miscues.The Georgia Bulldog Club is in essence the fundraising branch of the UGA Athletic Association, responsible for making sure student-athletes are able to obtain “scholarships, first class facilities and the [necessary] financial support,” per the organization’s official website. The group solicits contributions primarily from alumni, and awards season tickets and parking privileges based on how much one donates to The Hartman Fund, which exists specifically for Georgia football.A major criticism of former Oklahoma State coach Les Miles in the Sports Illustrated investigative piece was his decision to grant boosters access to players in the locker room, at the training table and during road trips.That type of access, however, is mostly limited at Georgia, and almost any interaction is highly discouraged from an official stance.“So many things in place now that keep the separation, keep the gap between the season ticket-holders and the donors and the student-athletes,” said Mark Slonaker, executive director of the Georgia Bulldog Club. “We have to be very careful when we do provide access to donors, either watching practice or being in the same room, the same environment as student-athletes are.”


 


“I tell a lot of them… don’t say anything but hello.”As far as boosters and high school recruits are concerned, there are rules already in place that prohibit most forms of in-person or electronic contact. The two are not even allowed on the same side of the Sanford Stadium during home games.And, of course, there are no locker room privileges on game days.“The compliance office does a tremendous job of making sure we don’t allow boosters, donors into the locker room, post-game. We just don’t do those things at Georgia,” Slonaker said.But with regards to active players, much of the discretion also falls under the jurisdiction of Mark Richt, head coach and leader of the school’s football program for the past 13 seasons.In that time, Georgia has enjoyed plenty of on-field success to the tune of a 119-41 record, eight bowl wins and two conference championships. But Richt's personal integrity, however, is well-regarded, and he remains a noted factor working to make sure that Georgia’s business is clean and in compliance with the NCAA. His players will be the first to say so.“One thing, if you ask a coach that watches Georgia or knows about Georgia, it’s [built around] tradition, but it does the right thing. You would never hear us come across any headline about taking this, taking that, because for one it comes from the head coach. The head coach is a great, Christian man where you’re going to do the right thing or you’re not going to be there,” sophomore cornerback Sheldon Dawson said. “The way our coach has had this program for the last 13 years or so, it’s tremendous. It starts from the head, and if he got a good head, if he got a good mind, then it rubs off on the whole team.”The 2012 dismissal of three players for rules violations (Nick Marshall, Chris Sanders and Sanford Seay) stands as solid evidence of Richt’s uncompromising efforts to play by the NCAA rules and live up to his own high standards.


TNCMS.AdManager.render({region: 'fixed-big-ad-bottom-asset', slot: 1, fold: ""below""});


Even so, heavy-handed regulations and the threat of sanctions have not stopped individual boosters before, and one coach can only do so much.In fact, the implications in the Oklahoma State investigation and in Pollack’s tweet are that boosters, and even assistant coaches in rare instances, have broken rules behind the head man’s back.“You can’t police everything. You can’t police human behavior. You can try, but you can’t control human behavior,” Richt said. “Obviously, that doesn't happen in life. It doesn’t happen on a team, either. You hope you’re creating a culture where people care enough to do the right thing. You want to create that culture within the team and also within your boosters. If you do anything that you know is against the rules, you’re just killing the thing that you know that you love and it makes no sense.”In many ways, prevention falls upon those working on the ground level, namely the players.For a team with as many talented freshmen as Georgia, and especially those that hail from humble economic backgrounds, the prospect of earning money on the side for positive performance would be understandably alluring – especially when several already feel they should be paid for playing.“I think you should be able to make yourself some money. Can’t have a job because of your football schedule and school. Life’s so busy. You need some kind of way to get some income,” senior defensive end Garrison Smith said.And so the only sensible solution for schools given the system in place is to make sure players know the rules of the NCAA game and hope that they are followed.“If a younger guy's being an idiot or doing something he’s not supposed to, you definitely go to step in and make sure they know what the rules are, what you can and can’t do,” senior quarterback Aaron Murray said. “It’s tough. There’s so, so many rules. It’s a pain in the butt, but that’s just the way it is and you just got to be smart.”

“You really have to first educate your own student-athletes,” Slonaker said. “Most of the situations you’re reading about now, somebody’s opened the door and let either agents or runners in, or those boosters that want to be involved and help with money and have some kind of an ulterior motive with the student-athletes.”Of course, many players also see the college game as a springboard to the lucrative ranks of professional football – and that’s not a chance that a player impatient for compensation should be willing to lose, says junior cornerback Damian Swann.“I think it comes with the territory. I think it comes with being that elite program,"" Swann said. ""This program is the closest you’re going to get to the NFL. With the dreams that I think every member of this team ought to have of playing in the NFL, you have to take the proper steps and you have to go through those things to get yourself prepared for it. I think this is one of the greatest opportunity a guy has to get prepared for that.”",Alec Shirkey,uganews,https://www.redandblack.com/uganews/booster-boundaries-set-around-uga-football-program/article_20df4ddc-213e-11e3-9367-001a4bcf6878.html
19-Sep-13,"UGA to pay North Texas $975,000 for game this Saturday","The University of Georgia Athletic Association is paying University of North Texas $975,000 to travel to Athens and play the Bulldogs in football this Saturday, which is a lot to spend on a cupcake.For years, college football powerhouses have paid smaller, weaker programs to travel and play away games on the larger programs’ home fields.The agreement between the two schools, which was signed in 2008, stipulates that Georgia must give North Texas 4,500 tickets to sell to its fans. Any tickets that were not sold by Aug. 30 were returned to the UGAAA. Georgia also allotted North Texas 300 complimentary tickets.


 


The game with North Texas was originally scheduled for Aug. 31, 2013, however, in 2009, the two schools agreed to move the game to September in order to enable the Bulldogs to take on the Clemson Tigers on Aug. 31.If either team should back out of the game, it would owe the other $600,000, unless the cancellation was mutually consensual.The full $975,000 must be received by North Texas by Jan. 31, 2014.Georgia will also pay Appalachian State University $325,000 for traveling to Athens for a game on Nov. 9.The contract with ASU was signed in 2005, while the game was originally scheduled for Sept. 5, 2009. The game date was then changed to the 2013 season in 2006, The UGAAA had to pay ASU $75,000 in 2007 for changing the date of the game.The distance each team must travel is one reason North Texas will receive $575,000 than ASU.Last season, the UGAAA played the University of Buffalo $975,000 to play a game in Athens.",Cy Brown,sports,https://www.redandblack.com/sports/uga-to-pay-north-texas-for-game-this-saturday/article_55a11b16-20af-11e3-9d84-0019bb30f31a.html
20-Sep-13,Edges: North Texas,"Offense:North Texas (2-1) will enter Saturday coming off a 34-27 win over Ball State in which they got great play from its senior quarterback.Derek Thompson was named Conference USA’s Offensive Player of the Week following the Ball State game where he went 31-for-47 for 274 yards and a touchdown. Thompson has paced the offense leading it to 31.7 points a clip, and 291 passing yards per game. But that was all against mediocre competition.


 


Unlike Thompson, Georgia (2-1, 1-0 SEC) quarterback Aaron Murray has proven his ability by putting up big numbers against two top-10 teams. Murray coming off a game where he went 17-of-23 for 309 yards and four touchdowns, while averaging 316 passing ypg.Murray is surrounded by playmakers, and after a bye week everyone will have fresh legs. Todd Gurley, who’s coming off a game where he received 30 carries, is atop the Southeastern Conference rushing category with 143 ypg, and will be completely healthy for the first time in two weeks. The Bulldogs have too many playmakers and I can’t see any team real slowing them down, nonetheless North Texas.Edge: GeorgiaDefense:Statistically North Texas has a better defense than Georgia. The Mean Green’s defense has given up an average of 20 points in their first three contests, while the Bulldogs have averaged 34 points against themselves. This will be the first game that the young Bulldogs defense hasn’t been matched against a top-10 team, and I think it could surprise some people. Georgia has struggled to get to the quarterback after facing two dual-threat signal callers, only collecting three sacks, but the Bulldogs will be facing a conventional quarterback in Thompson this week. I could see the Bulldogs applying constant pressure on Thompson, and force some turnovers.Edge: GeorgiaSpecial teams:The Bulldogs will be getting Marshall Morgan back this week after serving his two-game suspension for a boating under the influence arrest over the summer. Morgan went 8-for-14 last season on field goal attempts, hitting a long of 52 yards, while splitting kick-off duties with punter Colin Barber. Although Morgan’s stats don’t seem like much, he gives the Bulldogs the ability to knock in a long field goal, which hasn’t been the case this year. The longest attempted field goal for the Bulldogs was 37-yards this season off the foot of Patrick Beless, who was filling in for the absent Morgan. Beless went 2-for-2 on field goal attempts, and was perfect on extra points during his two-game stretch. The fact that Morgan returns this week gives the Bulldogs the edge.


 


Edge: GeorgiaCoaching:North Texas head coach Dan McCarney is in his third season at the helm for the Mean Green and has a record of 11-16. Before going to North Texas McCarney was the defensive line coach at Florida for three years, where he won a national championship in 2008. McCarney’s only other head-coaching job was at Iowa State from 1995-2006, and he has an overall record of 67-101.

Scattered boos must've motivated the Bulldogs offensively and defensively because the game was relatively one-sided from that point forward. The Bulldogs went on a 24-0 run to close the game, securing a 38-21 win. Georgia quarterback Aaron Murray had another standout performance in the win with over 400 yards passing and three touchdown passes. The running game seemed lackluster throughout, though running back Todd Gurley earned another 100-yard rushing game. Georgia's defense started off shaky, but in the end, only one of North Texas' scores came against the Bulldogs' defense (two special teams touchdowns). Freshman safety Tray Matthews earned Georgia's first interception of the season late in the third quarter.

23-Sep-13,Driving Athens Home: The Red & Black rides along with Designated Dawgs,"Designated Dawgs dedicates its weekends to driving Athens home — and the volunteers see the aftermath of an Athens weekend.Designated Dawgs, formerly Watch Dawgs, began in 2001 and is a student-run organization providing free rides home from downtown. The organization thrives on donations. Designated Dawg's current office in the Fred Building is donated and the club has several sponsors.The Red & Black rode along with a Designated Dawg volunteer and experienced a full night of operation.


 


Often, Designated Dawgs will have service clubs come to volunteer. On Friday night, that club was Alpha Phi Omega.Designated Dawgs began their night at 9:30 p.m. with donated food for volunteers and training sessions led by first-year executive members Annelise Wornap and Leigh Borkowski.Wornap, a sophomore double major in social studies education and political science from Savannah, said she began volunteering last year as “a fun way to spend a night downtown, but also give back to the community in a direct way.” She also enjoys getting to see exactly who she is helping and knowing that the service of Designated Dawgs “made a big difference.”The Dawgs had a slow night until about 11 p.m. when people began lining up for their free ride home. The Red & Black rode along with volunteer Nicola Wynn. Wynn, a senior double major in anthropology and sociology from Kennesaw, experienced her first night volunteering the night before with Alpha Phi Omega and “enjoyed providing a needed service to Athens and getting everyone home safe.”But riders do not have to be intoxicated to enjoy a free ride home in a Designated Dawgs SUV. One of the first rides given was to a late-night studier who did not feel like walking home.A group of three sorority members eager to appease their late night hunger giggled with a Jimmy John’s employee over the phone as they struggled to decide their order on their car ride home.At around 1 a.m., Wynn experienced a first in her new Designated Dawgs career. At the booth where riders sign up for a ride, a woman had to be told multiple times by her friend not to try to charge her dead iPhone by plugging it into the headphone jack of the speakers Designated Dawgs were using and to stop lying on the concrete.The rest of the night was busy as people began making their way home. Every time a volunteer returned to the Fred Building, another group was waiting for a ride.


 


Several groups of people walked by the Fred Building and wondered aloud how they have never heard of Designated Dawgs before.Most every rider expressed their gratitude throughout the ride home, calling volunteers “the best people ever” and “angels.”Wynn gave her last ride around 2:30 a.m. to a group of six guys who loudly sang their best, off-key rendition of “Bohemian Rhapsody.”On this night, there were no instances of riders relieving themselves in any way in the car. However, a night of drinking does occasionally come with some mishaps.Sarah Hughes, the executive director, said she has heard of and experienced people throwing up in cars, but has never heard of someone losing consciousness.“As a general rule of thumb, we will not take home anyone who cannot walk to the car on their own,” Hughes said.Last Thursday and Friday nights’ operation completed around 170 free rides home. Since it was founded in 2001, Designated Dawgs has given 73,500 rides home from downtown.Wynn enjoyed her second night of volunteering and “hearing how grateful people were in their drunken state.”

24-Sep-13,Football practice report: Bulldogs have a few health concerns ahead of LSU,"In preparation for the de facto national game of the week against No. 6 Louisiana State (4-0, 1-0 SEC), the No. 9 Georgia Bulldogs (2-1, 1-0 SEC) held another afternoon practice in full pads under the dreary light of an overcast sky just ahead of an evening rain shower.Three five-minute periods of that session were made available to the Red & Black. A few observations of note:
The Bulldogs look to have a few questions health-wise heading into Saturday, with tailback Keith Marshall (shoulder) and wide receivers Justin Scott-Wesley (shoulder) and Jonathon Rumph (hamstring) all sporting the green jerseys on Tuesday. Adding to that, neither tight end Jay Rome, who re-injured his ankle against North Texas, nor backup linebacker James DeLoach appeared to be practicing at all. Head coach Mark Richt, however, noted that most of these injuries are of the less-serious variety. “I think Keith will be fine, and Jay will probably give it a go today. Justin Scott-Wesley bruised his shoulder a little bit, but he’ll be fine. I’m not sure about [DeLoach],” Richt said during his weekly press conference. “We have to have him go through the concussion testing and all of that, and I don’t think he’ll go today. I would say he’s out for right now.”
As was typical of the open periods, both the offensive and defensive linemen spent most of their time working in the trenches, with the focus being footwork and hand placement. Kolton Houston again got most of his work at right tackle, and offensive line coach Will Friend said on Tuesday that he expects Houston to continue playing at that spot for the remainder of the season. He also mentioned that true freshman Brandon Kublanow will primarily serve as the backup left guard behind Dallas Lee moving forward.
The wide receivers ran a series of cone drills in a continuing attempt to hone the group’s route-running prowess. Rumph, a highly-touted JUCO transfer who has yet to make it onto the field this season, was a participant. Position coach Tony Ball noted that while Rumph has come along slowly due to injury, the team has no plans to redshirt him at this time. “You need as many quality guys as you can get, and he’s one of those guys. Redshirt is not a thought,” Ball said. “We want him to get healthy, and if he’s healthy for nine games, seven games, whatever the case may be, because it’s a long season, we want him to be ready to go and be a productive guy and a contributor within our offense.”
The quarterbacks worked on a series of short dropbacks and play-action passes to the tight ends. All of the team’s signal-callers were present, save for backup Parker Welch who was listed as “out” due to a cervical strain on the team’s injury report. Junior Hugh Williams, primarily a blocking tight end, appeared to be getting more drill work in the injured Rome’s place. Assistant coach John Lilly also led the tight ends in an exercise that focused on blocking technique.

24-Sep-13,Georgia attempts to fix special teams woes ahead of LSU,"The Georgia defense may have taken steps forward, but the Bulldogs' special teams unit took a few steps back during last weekend's win over North Texas.Two easily noticed mistakes — a kickoff returned for touchdown and a blocked punt taken back for another score — kept No. 9 Georgia (2-1, 1-0 SEC) closer to the Mean Green than many would have foreseen.To be fair, North Texas return man Brelan Chancellor averaged 32.11 yards per return this season, which is the 10th best mark in the nation. But the Bulldogs will face an athlete that possesses just as much talent as a returner, if not more, this coming weekend in the electrifying Odell Beckham Jr. Not even considering his game-changing presence on offense, the junior wide receiver has averaged 27.14 yards on kickoff returns (tied for 22nd in the country) and 13 yards per punt return (21st nationwide) this season.


 


That's no small order for a Bulldogs team that has also suffered special teams mishaps against Clemson (botched field goal snap by Nathan Theus) and South Carolina (dropped punt that led to a Gamecocks touchdown). Yet there’s hope within the team that Georgia will be able to correct its mistakes against the sixth-ranked Tigers (4-0, 1-0 SEC) on Saturday.“[Beckham] is obviously really, really talented,"" said Blake Sailors, a senior cornerback who considers special teams his bread and butter. ""But before this game we were doing awesome on special teams. I think we were like top 10 in pride [punt team] and doing really well on kickoffs.”“It’s not a hard fix. I feel like we can fix it, move on at LSU and have a great special teams game,” sophomore placekicker Marshall Morgan said.Head coach Mark Richt echoed the sentiments of his players during his Sunday teleconference.“We’ve been really covering kicks extremely well all year long and then you get one like that,"" he said. ""You might think it’s broken, but it’s really not broken. We’ve just got to go back to doing what we’ve been doing all year long, and that’s placing the ball where we want it and getting guys down there covering.” All claim special teams excellence, which in fact is true, though to varying degrees.The Bulldogs are ranked 43rd in punt return yards allowed, with opponents averaging six yards on just four run backs. Sophomore punter Collin Barber, who has averaged an outstanding 47.91 yards per punt (third in the nation), has shown plenty of improvement through the early stages of the season.“It’s huge. If [Barber] can just kick the crap out of the ball and kick it sky high, then we’re down there before the guy can even catch the ball,” Sailors said. “Hopefully he just can continue to do that.”


 


Whether the line can afford Barber consistent protection is another question that won't be answered until Saturday, though veteran tight end Arthur Lynch is a good bet to get the call right next time around.Georgia’s other ugly play from last weekend came on a kickoff, where Beckham has found plenty of success. And it’s also where the Bulldogs have allowed an average of 24.57 yards per kickoff — 114th in the nation.But the keys there, as fundamental as they may sound, come down to finishing tackles and closing up the proper running lanes, says Sailors.“Another thing that killed us last game on kick return is missed tackles. Against a team like this, just little details like a missed tackle or a little lane assignment. If you’re not in the right lane, he had a hole the size of a house to run through,” he said. “[Beckham] will take it to the house if just one thing goes wrong.”Another area of emphasis, or rather de-emphasis, would involve the kickoff strategy Georgia employed last weekend, which had Morgan kicking for height so as to draw the return man out of the end zone in an unfavorable situation. That, clearly, backfired on the Bulldogs.“My goal [this week] is just to kick it out of the end zone. I’m just going to try and kick it as deep as I can,” Morgan said.Considering the game’s magnitude, Georgia will also not rule out employing starters on a number of special teams units.“Before my injury, I was on every special team,” freshman safety Tray Matthews said. “My injury came, they took me off of every special teams to make sure I wouldn’t get hurt. I wouldn’t mind getting back on it, though. I haven’t really talked to the coach about it. I might do that. That’s more tackles I can get.”


TNCMS.AdManager.render({region: 'fixed-big-ad-bottom-asset', slot: 1, fold: ""below""});


“I might end up being on special teams just because of what happened in the previous game, the returns that they had.”Matthews isn’t the only one willing to contribute.Junior linebacker Ramik Wilson mentioned that both he and Amarlo Herrera are also being considered on a number of special teams, likely out of respect for what the Tigers can accomplish in that phase of the game.“We talked to coach about it. He’s going to start working us in during this week,” Wilson said. “Just to help out. We see that’s an area of weakness, but we’re going to be just fine.”The word ""coach"" also brings up an interesting facet of Georgia’s football program under Richt: the team has no special teams coordinator, per se. Instead, tight ends coach John Lilly and inside linebackers coach Kirk Olivadotti each handle a portion of special teams along with Richt.“There’s a coach for the pride and joy, the punt return. That includes the returner, the whole team. The kick return team, the kick return guys, he’s part of the kick return team, he’s that coach,” Morgan said. “It’s two different coaches.”And Richt’s role in coaching special teams has even expanded this season, says Morgan.“He’s done a great job of it over camp. We’d kick, he’d go over film with us. He’s trying to learn just as much as we are. Like what went wrong on this kick or what do you feel like you did good on this kick. He’s watch film with us, every time we did field goal he was there timing us and he was charting us,” he said. “I think it’s great that coach Richt’s doing that because that’s the man, that’s the head coach. If you feel comfortable around him, you’ve got nothing to worry about.”

If anything, Georgia hasn’t forgotten what LSU’s special teams unit did to UGA during the 2011 SEC Championship contest – a 42-10 walloping at the hands of the Tigers sparked by former cornerback Tyrann Mathieu’s 62-yard punt return score. He averaged just a hair under 30 yards per runback in that contest, adding a 47-yard return later on in the blowout win.“[The SEC Championship] is still back in our heads a little bit just because Honey Badger killed us,” Sailors said. “It was a big challenge then, but now we got another chance to get back at it.”The stakes are obviously high. Perhaps higher is Georgia’s desire for some special teams revenge.",Alec Shirkey,sports,https://www.redandblack.com/sports/georgia-attempts-to-fix-special-teams-woes-ahead-of-lsu/article_20212470-24d5-11e3-bebd-001a4bcf6878.html
24-Sep-13,Our take: It's up to fans to fight for players' rights,"On Saturday, a handful of college football players across America, including five Georgia offensive linemen, wrote the simple message of ""APU"" — which stands for All Players United — on their wristbands. This action was intended to show their feelings toward college players' treatment.The protest, organized by the National College Players Association, was significant in that it was the first time college players have taken a stand on the field of play.The act was silent, but the message was loud and clear. College players are tired of being controlled by a group of people whose allegiances lie with the all-mighty dollar and not with the game they claim to love or the players who destroy their bodies for the enjoyment of the masses. 


 


The silent protest was a fine first step on a long road to reform in college athletics, but after this small act, they have little recourse. Maybe more players will join them, writing ""APU"" on every piece of equipment their school (or the NCAA) will allow them to. They can't do much more, though.At major college football powerhouses, most players' ultimate goal is to reach the NFL. It is the pinnacle of their chosen profession. However, to make it to those heights, they must play through at least three years of college football, where their scholarships aren't guaranteed. Should they have a major injury, the school has every right not to renew that scholarship after a season. If a player decides he wants to transfer, his coach must approve the school he chooses and grant a release. The player's right to choose is infringed upon by a coach who may not want to play against that player down the line. College coaches' recommendations are held in high-esteem by NFL general managers and coaches, as well. If a player rocks the boat, he runs the risk of his coach taking it out on him by giving him a poor evaluation. With all this working against them, how can we expect players to speak for themselves and work for change from inside the machine?""I think fans are fed up with a lot of this, too,"" NCPA director Ramogi Huma said of the treatment of college athletes to USA Today. ""They might have as much leverage as the players themselves.""If there is going to be change, it is up to the fans. The players can't be expected to put their careers in danger during such a transitionary phase. They only have to put up with the NCAA and its rules for a few years; they keep their heads low, mouths shut and tow the company line.That's why the fans must take a stand and act in solidarity with players. It is the fans' money that ends up in pockets of the NCAA, so it should be the fans who demand their money start going to the people who need it — players who have permanently ruined their bodies in the name of college football. As long as the players display the simple ""APU"" message, they are doing their all to get the word out. It is the fans' job to take the baton and finish the race.—Cy Brown for the editorial board

25-Sep-13,"BigBelly feeds on UGA's trash, recycling","New compactors have popped up on campus and begun chomping down on UGA's trash and recycling.These compactors are part of a new initiative by UGA’s office of sustainability to help make trash on campus more environmentally friendly.“We call them waste reduction stations,” said Kevin Kirsche, director of sustainability at UGA. “We’ve got 60 total compactors going in at 30 different stations across campus, each with one trash and one recycling compactor. Our intention in general is to make it equally as easy to recycle as it is to throw something away. At every point of disposal we want to give people the opportunity to make the right decision.”


 


The new trash and recycling compactors are made by BigBelly solar, a company based out of Newton, Mass. and founded in 2003. The company is dedicated to “transforming one of the least efficient and resource-intensive industries on the planet — waste collection” into a more environmentally friendly process, according to its website (www.bigbelly.com).BigBelly compactors are solar powered and connected by their own solar powered wireless network. This allows the heads of the Office of Sustainability to see which compactors are full from their computers.This technology should speed up the pick-up process and save the office time and money.“These new compactors should really help reduce UGA’s carbon footprint,” said Jacob Spaulding, a junior environmental economics major and a sustainability intern from Blairsville. “They’re helpful in a lot of ways. By compacting trash at busy points on campus, it greatly reduces our need for trash bags. Also the trucks that take the trash to the Athens-Clarke County landfill now don’t need to come as often, which saves gas, and they don’t have to make as many trips because the compact trash saves a lot of space, which saves UGA money.”Each of the recycling compactors is set up for mixed recyclables and will take paper, plastic, glass and metal. When full, the compact recyclables are sent to the Athens-Clarke County Material Recycling Facility which is a single stream facility capable of taking co-mingled recyclables and differentiating them by weight and hand. Each reduction station is strategically placed to hit the busiest and most populous points on campus.These points turned out to be major bus stops and larger buildings on campus including the corner of Baldwin Street and Sanford Drive, inside the Tate Center and the SLC, in front of the North Campus Parking Deck as well as 26 other high traffic locations.“The compactors have really only started going in in the past few weeks,” said Katie Dennison, a senior Spanish and English major and intern at the Office of Sustainability from Lilburn. “Although, we’ve had a pilot project at Tate for the past couple years to see if people liked them and would actually use them as much as a normal trash can — which worked out really well. And now you should start to see them popping up all over campus.”","Arvind Deol

25-Sep-13,"Shiny new UGA:  President Morehead talks projects, new faculty at cabinet meeting","University of Georgia President Jere Morehead discussed capital projects, new faculty and pride for the university and its students at his cabinet meeting Wednesday.Although reluctant to brag about rankings, Morehead noted UGA’s recent ranking by the U.S. News and World Report as number 20 in the list of top public universities.He also said the freshman class of 2013 was the “most qualified freshman class in the history of the University of Georgia.” The freshman class possessed an average GPA of 3.8, an average SAT score of 1280 and an ACT average of 29. The honors program’s incoming freshmen’s GPA was 4.07, their average SAT score was 1462 and the average ACT score for an honors program freshman was 33, he said.


 


The president opened his topic of capital projects with mention of the proposed Science Learning Center that the Board of Regents of the University System of Georgia approved at their last meeting. The Regents approved the $44.7 million budget for both the design and construction of the building.Morehead said University Architects are heavily evaluating the possible sites for the center and the space chosen will be the cheapest.“We want this to be a signature building for the campus, but we don’t want anything that’s in any way viewed as extravagant,” he said. “This is going to be a building that will fully serve our student body and make sure that we continue to grow our ability to support students in the STEM disciplines.”The president will have a meal with the department heads of the sciences that will have potential labs or classes in the building because, he said, teachers should be “heavily involved” with the project.“I just want to make sure we get it right, that we build something that we are all really proud of,” he said.Other projects underway on campus include the construction of the new Bolton Dining Commons on the corner of Baxter and Lumpkin streets. The building is slated to open in the Fall 2014 semester, Morehead said.He also talked briefly about phase one of the Terry College of Business’s Business Learning Community. Construction for the first installation of the center, Correll Hall, will begin in a few months, Morehead said, and will be located across Baxter Street from the site of the new dining hall.On College Station Road, construction of the veterinary medicine teaching hospital is underway.


 


“That’s another opportunity for us to boost both our instruction and service capacity, as well as ultimately help us with our research capacity in that college,” Morehead said.Along with the new buildings appearing around campus, the administrative positions of the provost, the vice president for finance and administration, the vice president for development and alumni relations and an executive director for legal affairs need to be filled. Interim placeholders fill the provost, the vice president for finance and administration and the executive director of legal affairs’s positions now. Tom Landrum, the current vice president for development and alumni relations, according to Morehead, has given ample notice of his retirement to ensure that a successor can be found, trained and the transition made seamless.Committees have been formed for finding all positions. On-campus meetings for the provost and executive director of legal affairs are planned for the coming months with the hopes that the positions will be filled by the end of the calendar year, Morehead said. Potential dates for the filling of the other two positions were not discussed.","By Stephen Mays

25-Sep-13,Georgia battens down the hatches as a deep LSU backfield rolls into Athens,"Jeremy Hill ran rampant against Auburn last Saturday.LSU's sophomore running back put up huge numbers against the SEC West rival this past weekend, racking up 183 rushing yards on 25 carries with three touchdowns to boot. Hill's performance earned him SEC offensive player of the week honors. But, more importantly for the 6-foot-2, 235-pound mammoth, his running game is in top form as the No. 6 Tigers prepare to come to Athens to face off against the No. 9 Bulldogs.""Hill obviously is a beast,"" Georgia head coach Mark Richt said. ""Got to see him Saturday night [against Auburn] and the things that he did he's been doing all throughout his career.""


 


In his freshman season, Hill came in strong, accumulating 755 yards on the ground with 12 rushing scores. Perhaps the most telling part of Hill's performances, though, was his ability to play well against more competitive opponents. Against LSU's tougher opponents last season — Alabama, Texas A&M, South Carolina and Clemson — Hill totaled 482 of those yards, earning half of his season's touchdowns in those four contests.His ability to come up big in marquee games in his young career will certainly help eliminate any jitters he has coming into this Saturday's matchup in Athens.Hill, however, won't be the Bulldogs' only worry in the Tigers' backfield. LSU sports a handful of talented backs who have been known to have huge games of their own.""They've got a tremendous combination of running backs,"" Richt said. ""He's complemented by No. 4 [Alfred] Blue. [Kenny] Hilliard's a player. They've got about four backs there that have all gained over 100 yards in a game and have all been the guy.""That doesn't even mention junior Terrence Magee who sits second on the team in rushing yards so far this year. But it's the third and fourth-leading rushers for the Tigers this season that the Bulldogs are most familiar with. In the 2011 SEC Championship, Blue and Hilliard were the backs that ran wild against the Bulldogs.In that conference title game, Blue led the team with 94 yards and a touchdown with Hilliard not far off, adding 72 yards and two scores. Both had just eight carries.Defensive line coach Chris Wilson isn't going to let his unit under-appreciate the spectacular depth of the LSU running game.""LSU's always going to have great backs in their backfield,"" Wilson said. ""The biggest challenge is all of their backs are different, and they pose their set of concerns once they're out there.""


 


Perhaps the biggest threat in the LSU backfield isn't even a running back, though. The Tigers' senior fullback J.C. Copeland is at the forefront of the team's run blocking scheme and his 6-foot-1, 272-pound frame coupled with his surprising speed poses uncommon mismatches for opposing defenses.""A lot of their blocking schemes are led by Copeland, the big fullback,"" Richt said. ""He's a beast, too. He can run the ball, as well. They'll hand him the ball some, similar to how we're starting to get Quayvon [Hicks] going in our system.""His size challenges linebackers who aren't accustomed to receiving as big of a hit as they're delivering.""He's a mountain boy, and all those boys are big,"" Georgia sophomore linebacker Jordan Jenkins said. ""We have to stay low and be ready to take some hits this week.""On the flip side, Georgia's defense has already displayed steady improvement against the run in 2013. Georgia struggled in the season-opener against Clemson's Roderick McDowell (22 carries for 132 yards) and against South Carolina's Mike Davis the following week (16 carries for 149 yards).But, last week, the Bulldogs held the North Texas Mean Green rushing attack to just seven yards, allowing a jaw-dropping minus-2 yards in the first half. Despite the inferior opponent, the impressive run defense last week will surely help the front seven's confidence heading into an opponent that tries to set the tone with the run.""We had a pretty good defensive game Saturday,"" Jenkins said. ""I just feel we have to have that this game. If we let them run and just be confident in their run game, it's just going to be a pretty nasty game for us.""With LSU quarterback Zach Mettenberger back in the pocket, stopping the Tigers from sustaining the run will be of the utmost importance in order to eliminate an added pressure on the young Georgia secondary. 


TNCMS.AdManager.render({region: 'fixed-big-ad-bottom-asset', slot: 1, fold: ""below""});


""If we don't stop the run, we're never going to get the chance to rush against them,"" Jenkins said. ""We really have to stop the run early on, and when we get the chance to run some pressures, we really have to affect Mettenberger.""",Benjamin Wolk,sports,https://www.redandblack.com/sports/georgia-battens-down-the-hatches-as-a-deep-lsu-backfield/article_80085d3a-2571-11e3-87d2-001a4bcf6878.html

All the while, unbeknownst to us, new legends are being formed right beneath our eyes. Thursday, Sept. 26Hope For Agoldensummer: At Flicker Theatre & Bar at 8 p.m. for $5, this band will play with another local folk band, Sea of Dogs, and a singer-songwriter from Nashville named Loney Hutchens. Hope For Agoldensummer has been at the center of much hype lately, especially leading up to AthFest this summer. The band seems to have impressed locals with its female-led soft, slow folk sound. This one is on the rise.


 


Jay Gulley: The Melting Point will feature the former guitarist and lead vocalist for the Modern Skirts, Jay Gulley, at 8 p.m. for $15 in advance and $18 at the door. The Modern Skirts, first formed in 2004, made it big in Athens for a while. Michael Stipe of R.E.M. once even named the Modern Skirts his favorite Athens band in 2007, which has to be the best endorsement a band can get in Athens. In early 2013, the band announced it would disband, and the members have since been exploring solo careers with small sets around town. Another frontman, Grant-Lee Phillips of the band Grant Lee Buffalo, will open the show.Friday, Sept. 27Caroline Aiken: At the Office Lounge at 9:30 p.m. this singer-songwriter will perform for free. She has her own sort of antique style that takes you back in time. Her voice has a blues timber to it that lends itself to older styles of playing. She is a master at creating a well-rounded sound and telling a story with her voice. She plays consistently around town, so catch her show sometime soon.Dodd Ferrelle: For another age-inspired sound, check out Dodd Ferrelle's show at Hendershot's Coffee Bar at 8 p.m. for free. Ferrelle's voice is old and crackling, but it fits perfectly with his folk-rock sound. He aims to tell stories with his songs, and his music reckons back to the folk history from the ‘40s to the ‘60s. A local Americana band, Asher Armstrong, will also play that night.Saturday, Sept. 28Casper & the Cookies: This is another older music legend from Athens. The band will play at 10 p.m. at Little Kings Shuffle Club. Others playing include The Shut-Ups, a new-wave pop group from Atlanta and Athens, and Cult of Riggonia, a world music instrumental group. Casper & the Cookies formed in 1998 around leader Jason NeSmith, a multi-instrumentalist and singer was recording solo music under the moniker Casper Fandango. The band released eight albums in varying cassette, CD and digital formats. NeSmith has joined many other bands since, including of Montreal's 2004 tour band for ""Satanic Panic In the Attic.""Eddie & the Public Speakers: This trio is back at it after a brief stint off the stages of Athens and performs at the Georgia Theatre at 8 p.m. for $10. Local legend Chickasaw Mudd Puppies, who played a sold-out reunion show two weeks ago, will also play. Eddie & the Public Speakers is a stand-out modern Athens band. It has roots in the soul-funk genre and plays heavily off its guitars.Sunday, Sept. 29


 


Callaghan: The Melting Point will host Callaghan and Erick Baker, a country rock artist from Nashville for $7 in advance and $10 at the door at 7:30 p.m. For all the feminist music lovers, this singer will prove her musical skills with a strong melodic voice. She has been compared to Sarah McLachlan and Jewel. Her music is pop-centric and uplifting. She spent time in London singing and playing but has since relocated to Atlanta to record her songs. She has one album called ""Life in Full Colour,"" proving the British influence in its spelling.","Hilary Butschek

26-Sep-13,Judah & the Lion's concerts present personalities not seen in album,"This weekend in live music proves to be promising.Kicking it off early this Thursday is Judah & the Lion who is headlining a show at 40 Watt Club alongside Sam Burchfield and Jason Gridley.Judah & the Lion is an American folk band that hails from Nashville. The trio consists of lead singer Judah Akers, mandolinist Brian Macdonald and banjo player Nate Zuercher. The group formed from humble origins in late 2011 when it released its debut EP ""First Roots"" in the summer of 2012. Most recently, Judah & the Lion released a second EP ""Sweet Tennessee"" and set out across the U.S. to promote it.


 


The story behind how the band forms isn't your average story where a group of friends decide to just form a band and play locally. The creation stemmed from Akers' desire to record some songs he had written.""Basically, the gist of the start is that I had some songs written that I wanted to record,"" Akers said. ""I wanted this folksy sound, one that used a mandolin and a banjo. I called Nate, who didn't know me at the time, but I had seen him around campus, and told him I played baseball at Belmont University in Nashville. I told him I had these songs done and asked him to play banjo with me. So we met up and he brought Brian along. Everything just all felt right between us.""Working together with each other for nearly two years helped the band cultivate a sound of its own. The ""Sweet Tennessee"" EP represents the first set of tracks they've recorded in which everyone was heavily involved in the creative process from songwriting to its final release.""We started with 'First Roots' in June 2012. Those were the songs that Judah had initially written before we got together as a band, our first big release,"" Zuercher said. ""Our first show came later in August. After that, we started to write together and develop more of what we could call our specific sound, bringing those aspects of who we are together. Recording 'Sweet Tennessee' this February was exciting because we got to go in and have this project we were proud of and felt fully represented by.""In terms of Judah & the Lion's sound, it began solely with the typical bluegrass folk sound because of the group's arrangement. However, the more the band worked together, more of their influences have become more evident in their music.""I would say it has an old-time element to it with the instruments,"" Macdonald said. ""Now there's also a progressive side to it also since Nate and I grew up listening to punk rock. Most recently we've been influenced by hip-hop, which is evident in the rhythms we're using, and we're definitely trying to show that.""Judah & the Lion's show Thursday night won't be your typical folk concert though.""We are a folk band, but the three of us love having a good time and having fun,"" Akers said. ""What we love about shows is that it gives us a chance to show off a part of our personalities you normally wouldn't know from listening to the CD. It's not a lively rock show, but there's enough dancing and sweating. We aspire to connect with the audience.""


 


With a band this excited to perform in Athens, you're guaranteed to have a good time.Judah & the Lion showWhere: 40 Watt ClubWhen: Thursday, Sept. 26, 9 p.m.Price: $5","Andrew Plaskowsky

26-Sep-13,Jacuzzi Boys soak in grimy excess,"It started in the back of a flatbed truck.Bassist Danny Gonzales had never met Gabriel Alcala and Diego Monasteri before that night. He was out on the town with friends and found himself sitting in a pickup truck, drinking beers with the men who would soon become his bandmates.Alcala (guitar) and Monasteri (drums) had played on and off since high school and recently founded their latest musical efforts, the Jacuzzi Boys. They had a sound, but something was missing. They needed something to shore up their rhythms, to support their improvisation and keep the songs flowing steady. They found what they needed in Gonzales.


 


“I went out one night with a mutual friend of ours, and they were just hanging out and drinking in the back of a friend’s car,” Gonzales said. “We got to talking about music and realized we had a lot in common, and they invited me to join up.”Now a trio, the boys headed out into the Miami underground, touring clubs and wowing audiences with their lo-fi, buzzy pop songs. Gaining a reputation for a great live show and a healthy dose of musical talent, the Boys attracted attention from the upper echelons of the musical world. An unexpected shout out from punk statesman Iggy Pop brought national notice to the Miami men and opened doors the band never quite expected to walk through.“It’s way cool ... It’s just totally amazing for us to hear this from a guy like him,” Gonzales said. “We actually got to hang out with him earlier this year ... He’s so different from what you’d expect, he’s not trying to put on a show. He’s just this very naturally cool, laid-back guy.”Pop’s endorsement gave the Jacuzzi Boys some confidence to take some chances on its newest record. While previous records (2009’s “No Seasons” and 2011’s “Glazin’”) gave the band a chance to replicate its live show on a recordable format, 2013’s self-titled “Jacuzzi Boys” sees the band expanding into new styles.Focusing more heavily on synthesized backings and intricate, heavily produced songwriting, the album caused some critics to accuse the group of departing from its original sound. The Boys, however, maintain that the new album is an evolution of sound, rather than a radical shift.“If you listen to ‘Glazin,’ you can hear some of the synthesized stuff in the background of the tracks,” Gonzales said. “We had space to try some new things, but they were things we’d always wanted to try.”The band certainly had plenty of space to try new things. While the first two albums were recorded with minimum studio time and replications of live shows, an advance by label Hardly Art gave the boys a chance to explore new territories as they refined their sound. Holing up in famed Florida production studio Key Club, the Boys took days to smooth down the tracks to a smooth, glazed version of excitable garage-rock.“We all had stuff we wanted to try, and this just gave us a chance to,” Gonzales said. “Gabriel usually does the rhythms and lyrics, and we put in the base ... Nobody comes to rehearsal with a fully-formed song. We work everything out together.”


 


The new album has kicked off a new round of touring for the group, teaming with similar surf-sound pioneers Wavvves and King Tuff for a laid-back, blissed-out good time. While touring with new groups can be a tough balancing act for any band, the Boys have blended well with these like-minded musicians.“A lot of times when you’re playing with new people, it can be tough to really get along,” Gonzales said. “But we really like these guys ... We’re not ever going to be best of friends, but we get along well and we have fun together.”Forward-thinking and forward-moving, the Jacuzzi Boys are a band to watch as they move ever upward in rock’s social circles. But for now, they just want to put on a good show for the people of Athens and everyone beyond.“If you come out, you’ll have a guaranteed good time,” Gonzales said. “At least, I’m hoping. It’ll be a good night. We have fun.”","Colby Newton

26-Sep-13,New business' beer on Baxter not on tap for freshmen temptation,"Since the beginning of the semester, two restaurants have opened on Baxter Street that serve alcohol, play music and provide an atmosphere freshmen living in the high rises may not be used to.But University of Georgia freshman Ashley Peterson, a social work major from Marietta, doesn't expect the growth of their surrounding across the street to affect her.“Freshmen could [try to drink there], but there are also already a bunch of places downtown that people have already established that they can get drinks at,” Peterson said. “So, I don’t know if it is going to be so much worse now that it is closer, but it could be.”


 


Groucho’s Deli has had its eye on Athens for about four years, said Kevin Lloyd, operating manager for the location that opened on Baxter Street. The restaurant found its current location in the winter, and opened there Aug. 2.Lloyd has seen a range of people visit so far, from students, to families with kids.“It’s all the way across the board,” he said. “We have your grandpas that went to UGA all the way down to the future UGAers.”Groucho’s has four beers on tap, but Lloyd said the restaurant is not pushing the sale of it — they just want to have it as an option.“The community shouldn’t have anything to worry about,” Lloyd said.He said “underage kids don’t drink here” and they are all careful to make sure every ID is checked.Erica Trotter, a freshman environmental economics major from Cumming, said she would not attempt to drink at the deli.“They are going to check IDs so freshmen supposedly can’t go in [for a drink], so I don’t care,” she said.


 


Closeby, a new Pizza Hut opened “about 3 weeks ago,” Mo Lutz, talent booker for the restaurant, said. The Pizza Hut moved into the spot previously taken by Gumby’s Pizza. Gumby’s did not sell alcohol, according to a Yelp page about the restaurant. It also didn’t feature live music.“The Hut on Baxter,” as the new restaurant has been branded, offers 15 different types of beers and weekend entertainment.“It is not your typical Pizza Hut,” Lutz said. “This location offers live music and entertainment mainly on Friday and Saturday, but on some weeknights as well. It also offers karaoke and trivia on Sundays.”The location “made perfect sense,” Lutz said.“We wanted to have a dine-in restaurant and there wasn’t really a dine-in pizza/Italian restaurant over on this side [of town] at all, and there was absolutely no live entertainment on this side at all, so we wanted to address those issues for this part of the community,” he said.Musicians performing at the Hut include Philippe Bertaud, Scott Baxendale and the Reluctant Saints, recent winners of the Georgia Music Hall of Fame Best Country Rock band. The restaurant also welcomes local bands and musicians of all genres to play. Performance schedules will be posted on The Red & Black calendar.“We are a serious listening room; we bring in top tier entertainment,” Lutz said.So far he has seen a lot of “UGA people” come in, from graduate students living in the neighborhood behind the store to freshman across the street in the dorms.

“It’s the perfect spot to have a pizza and a beer in the evenings,” Lutz said.Lutz said they may not be getting any criticism because alcohol is not the restaurant’s main focus.“We [aren’t] emphasizing the alcohol, and that may be it. We are emphasizing the live entertainment,” he said. “We are emphasizing the restaurant, so it just so happens that we are able to sell beer as well. It’s not like it’s an issue kind of thing like ‘Hey come have some beer.’ No, it’s more of come have some food, listen to some really great music of all different genres and the fact that we have beer is cool.”","By Jana French

27-Sep-13,Netherworld serves spooks for the season,"First time visitors to Netherworld need to remember three things: don’t run from the actors (inside or outside the haunts), take time to enjoy the atmosphere in the parking lot and bring friends that you trust and don’t mind sweating with/on.When I first ventured to Netherworld on Friday the 13th, I did my best to follow these rules.Any friends who had been to Netherworld before said one of two things — “It is the scariest and best thing to do in the fall. We’ll have to go again together,” or “I definitely cried the first time, but there are emergency exits throughout it and the actors won’t scare you if you cry.”


 


For someone who cowers away from any scary movies, I couldn’t help but wonder why I volunteered to see the two new haunts, the Dead Ones and the Boogeyman.Even though I couldn’t offer an accurate comparison to any of Netherworld’s past attractions, the two haunts completed the task of frightening me. And somehow I managed to survive the night without crying or screaming (too) loudly.Both haunts are paths which twist and turn over themselves within a warehouse, and the combination of lighting fixtures, heavy drapery and fear left me uncomfortably sweaty as I walked through the set-up. And I’m sure the guy in front of me didn’t appreciate when my clammy hands grabbed the back of his in a moment of terror.Lesson one: Make sure to have a friend in front of you and behind you to avoid uncomfortable interactions with stranger.This year, the Dead Ones is the longer of the two haunts, and it took about 30 minutes to go all the way through. It was the less frightening haunt for me because it was filled with the typical Halloween tricks — creepy woman in a room of mirrors, hands that launch out at you, mummified man, etc.The haunt still managed to frighten me though, especially because I didn’t know which turns would take me closer to the exit and which would place me directly in front of an actor.And while most actors simply pop out at you, I made a nice “friend” along the way. The guy who accompanied me picked out the actor who frightened me the most and asked him to follow me through his section. He complied and subtly stepped on my heels until I turned around. “Boo” — it was only a whisper. And cue my scream.Lesson two: Tell your friends not to do this beforehand, if it will deter them. If it would only encourage them, do your best to slap on a smile.


 


Even though some of the characters and setups were predictable, I learned to always watch out for rooms with fog machines. You really never know who could be hiding there.The Boogeyman, however, was a whole different experience.Before entering the haunt, the group is warned that “everything from your worst nightmares are inside.” And this was right.The characters in the Boogeyman haunt were all forms of mutilated humans, and were therefore much more frightening to me. This haunt was half the length of the Dead Ones, but it was much more actor-based, and I could barely make it through without crying. Fewer special effects were used, so the scenes throughout the haunt felt more realistic.Either before getting in line or after exiting the haunts, make sure to hang around the parking lot. The actors who hang around outside are equipped with cool costumes and metal kneepads, allowing them to slide across and create sparks on the asphalt.The actors seem to single out the most frightened visitors to chase around the parking lot or approach in line, but that’s only because it’s their job.For me, the parking lot was half the fun, because after a while, the creepy characters became pretty cool to talk to. I got to talk to the decaying pirate about his favorite fellow character (the warrior woman in a metal bikini top), I held a conversation with a ventriloquist’s dummy carrying a meat cleaver named Buddy, and I saw how much of a photo hog the harlequin with three faces was.Lesson three: Stick around in the parking lot. You get to hear a few slip-ups from the actors (ask the faceless vulture-like creature how she deals with her heavy wings), and it makes the experience less frightening if you need it. Or at the very least, you can enjoy the sight of frightened visitors screaming as a flash of sparks goes past them.

27-Sep-13,Player Likeness: LSU tops UGA in triple OT in NCAA 14,"This season, senior reporter Alec Shirkey and football reporter Benjamin Wolk will play a game of NCAA Football 14 each week mimicking the matchup which Georgia has. This week, they played No. 9 Georgia vs. No. 6 LSU.FINAL: LSU 57, UGA 55 (3OT)Alec Shirkey, LSU:


 


You play to win the game, as Herm Edwards might say. So I did.Maybe it was a slim margin of victory, and perhaps it did come down to a two-point conversion in triple overtime (hey, I don't make the rules here).But you can't forget Ben's pick-six, another pick in the end zone and the lone punt of the game that all led to his demise in the first place. And without a fourth-and-goal conversion from Ben with eight seconds left (on a pass that I should've picked off), we wouldn't have even seen overtime.Sure, I did throw three interceptions. I also only missed on four passes, and all of those picks came in the first half when I was more than willing to take a risky shot down the field. Then I found my rhythm and absolutely tore up the Georgia secondary to the tune of about 19 yards per passing play. Jarvis Landry had six catches for 167 yards and two scores on Sheldon Dawson and Brendan Langley. Enough said, really.Our boy B-Wolk put up a decent fight his first time out, but in a battle of evenly-matched teams I still got my second W of the season.Benjamin Wolk, Georgia:It came down to one play.I trusted in the beast that is fullback Quayvon Hicks on my two-point conversion try in triple overtime. He was stopped just short.


 


Shirkey punched in a score and converted the two-pointer a few plays later and, I'll admit, it was tough to handle.But after looking over the stat sheet the loss is almost laughable. As Georgia, I had six more first downs, 79 total yards, one less turnover and controlled the tempo for the game's entirety. Quite frankly, the only area Shirkey out-performed me was in two-point conversions (and, ultimately the score). I was 0-for-1. He was 1-for-1. It's as simple as that.Who made that rule anyways? Why are you required to convert a two-point conversion once the third overtime arrives? Even Shirkey knows the constant pressure on Mettenberger would have added up, and he, eventually, would've tossed his fourth interception of the game and the Georgia offense wasn't going to stop scoring. But, leave it to the NCAA to mandate something that robs college athletes of hours of hard work, and allows games to be decided by a couple winner-take-all, two-yard plays (you knew someone would have to blame the NCAA somehow).Sure, my first time on the sticks this season didn't have the final outcome I would have liked, but I can proudly say this: Today, the better team lost.LSU stats:470 yards total offense22 first downs25 rushes, 93 yards, 2 TD

28-Sep-13,Former UGA football player arrested in Athens,"A former Georgia football player was arrested early Friday based on a warrant issued for contempt of court in Athens-Clarke County.Carlton James Thomas, 24, a former tailback for the Bulldogs, was arrested by ACC police at 2:53 a.m., according to an Athens-Clarke County police report. ACCPD pulled Thomas over after seeing him almost hit another car while changing lanes.The officer found Thomas “had a warrant out of Clarke County Municipal Court for Contempt of Court,” and arrested him, according to the report. He was booked into the ACC jail at 3:35 a.m. and released at 12:05 p.m. Friday.


 


Thomas was with another former UGA football player.Thomas played football for UGA from 2008 until  2012, when he announced he was transferring from the program. During his time as a player, Thomas was suspended from three games due to “violation of team rules.”Thomas could not be reached by The Red & Black for comment.",JANA FRENCH,cops,https://www.redandblack.com/cops/former-uga-football-player-arrested-in-athens/article_68cb7a42-2848-11e3-9ea9-0019bb30f31a.html
28-Sep-13,Game rewind: Murray orchestrates offensive explosion between the hedges,"The fireworks were on full display in Sanford Stadium. No. 9 Georgia (3-1, 2-0 SEC) kept its national title hopes alive in stunning fashion during its 44-41 victory over No. 6 LSU (4-1, 1-1 SEC) on Saturday, pulling ahead with less than two minutes remaining on a 25-yard Aaron Murray touchdown pass. The Bulldogs defense, however, would prove ultimate savior as it finally managed to stop Zach Mettenberger and the LSU offense on fourth down with 50 seconds left, sealing the win for the home team. But leading up to that moment was an embarrassment of offensive production, with the two teams trading touchdowns and field goals at every turn in this tug-of-war shootout. The ex-Bulldog Mettenberger cut through a soft Georgia secondary time after time, completing 23 of his 37 passes for a career-high 372 yards, plus three touchdowns and no interceptions. Not to be outdone, Murray completed 20 throws for 298 yards and four touchdowns (along with an interception), most of which came without the help of leading rusher Todd Gurley, who went down with a foot injury during the second quarter. Sophomore Keith Marshall would shoulder the load in his absence, logging 20 carries for 96 yards.Outside of an electric offensive showing, Georgia found two surprise performances from both its run defense and special teams units. Jeremy Hill was held to 90 yards for 21 carries and his lowest per-carry average of the season (4.1 yards a rush). And as for special teams...PLAY OF THE GAME: Odell Beckham fumble recovered by Connor Norman


 


Georgia entered this game with a number of question marks surrounding its special teams unit. After all, the Bulldogs had committed some sort of mistake (blocked punt, botched snap, dropped punt) in that phase of the game in each of its 2013 contests. This time, however, special teams came through in a big way when Beckham, the shifty LSU wideout, fumbled on a punt return, and a waiting Norman pounced on the ball to give Georgia possession inside of the Tigers 30-yard line. Many will point to Aaron Murray's game-winning fourth-quarter drive and his strike to Justin Scott-Wesley in the corner of the end zone, but without this turnover the Bulldogs perhaps don't even get this opportunity. This play was one of just two turnovers in the game, and it ended up costing LSU the game.PLAYER OF THE GAME: QB Aaron MurrayCould we really give it to anyone else? Murray bailed out the defense time after time in this contest. When the Tigers had left a man open in coverage, Murray found him. When the Bulldogs needed a quick score, he took the offense down the field at a blistering pace. When UGA desperately needed an answer, he found one. And almost all of this all came without Gurley's presence. Have a day.OVERLOOKED PLAYER OF THE GAME: WR Chris ConleyThe junior led his team in receiving with five catches for 112 yards and a touchdown, including a spectacular 33-yard snag on 3rd and long that led to one of many Georgia scores on the day. He also proved efficient as a perimeter blocker, something the Bulldog receiving corps struggled with against North Texas. Against LSU, both Gurley (before his injury) and Marshall were able to bounce their runs to the outside, and Conley is part of the reason why.INTERESTING STAT: First SacksGeorgia had a number of firsts when it came to sacking Mettenberger. Jordan Jenkins recorded his first of the season. Nose tackle Chris Mayes, a JUCO transfer this offseason, made the first sack of his UGA career. And defensive end Ray Drew busted through the LSU line for one of his own, which was his first since being credit with a half-sack in 2011. The Bulldogs had four sacks in all on the night.Also of note: Murray passed Eric Zeier on the UGA career passing yards list in this game. He now has the second-most yards in school history.

29-Sep-13,The wrath of Athens upon Tiger faithful,"My LSU weekend started at 4:30 Friday morning with a jarring wakeup call from some enthusiastic Tiger fans. It ended with a halfhearted police report, but I won’t get ahead of myself.“Hey are you home? I’m at your door, come let me in.”Never mind my 8 a.m. marketing class on Friday mornings, I groaned my way to the door to let in the die-hard LSU fans I thought I had seen the last of when I moved to Georgia.


 


I thought I knew what I was getting myself into when I offered up my couch, but the early arrival was just a small inkling into what the weekend would bring. As the sun set over downtown Athens that night, cars decked out with tiger-print flags paraded their way down Broad Street, down Lumpkin Street, down East Campus Road — down every throughway imaginable — while people in purple polos and gold beads trickled down the sidewalks. Many commented on how nice the town is, and beamed at the “welcoming” UGA fans.Little did they know how ruthless Athens can really be to outsiders.The morning of reckoning came, and I braved my way down Broad Street looking for tickets for my houseguests. Each corner we came to held the promise of another scalper with a fresh batch of legally-frowned-upon tickets.After negotiating the price, purchasing the tickets and letting the anticipation for the SEC showdown of the decade grow, I waltzed into the stadium to watch my friends get promptly denied entrance.Their overpriced fake tickets got them VIP seats to watch the game at the bar at Herschel’s Famous 34 among a crowd of Georgia fans already on-edge because they, too, could not find their way into the stadium.But as if the crowd inside of Herschel’s weren’t adamant enough in their heckling, the herds of ecstatic Bulldog fans that flooded down Clayton Street to celebrate the victory quickly overwhelmed those unfamiliar with Saturdays in Athens.Like a fish swimming upstream (all night long), we struggled our way through the sea of red that overtook downtown. With the chapel bell providing a continuous tune for the night, I proudly shuffled through my favorite city, while my friends soaked up their defeat.


 


But, much like their arrival in Athens, they left hours before daylight on Sunday, with little warning. I heaved a sigh of relief, only to hear a frantic knocking on my door five minutes later.“My car is gone.”And just like that, Athens gave them the final blow — the big K.O., if you will. Down and out, they called OnStar, the Athens-Clarke County Police and every towing company in town, while I groggily looked for my landlord’s business card. One hundred and sixty-five dollars later, the car was free from impound and they were ready to speed down Atlanta Highway, back to a potentially friendlier Baton Rouge.They said their goodbyes, both to me and to the town that can apparently tear you down just as much as a long weekend in Vegas.I’ve always viewed Athens as a town full of SEC sized wonderment, where anyone will respond with a smile whenever you mention football or sweet tea. But it seems once you’ve mixed too little sleep with too much purple and gold, Athens can be a ruthless mistress.—Laura Thompson is the views editor for The Red & Black","Laura Thompson

With three top-10 matchups now in the rear-view mirror, the Florida Gators (No. 18), who soundly beat Kentucky 24-7 over the weekend, are the only ranked team remaining on Georgia's schedule.Elsewhere in the SEC, Alabama maintained a vice-grip on its top overall spot by shutting out the previously undefeated Ole Miss Rebels 25-0 at home. South Carolina, in a matchup many considered to be a ""trap game,"" overcame an injury to quarterback Connor Shaw and scraped by UCF in a 28-25 road victory.


 


Unranked Tennessee similarly outlasted an upset bid by South Alabama, winning (unconvincingly) 31-24 at home after the Jaguars scored 17 unanswered points in the second half.

30-Sep-13,Fullbacks Quayvon Hicks and Merritt Hall in 'ongoing competition' for starting spot,"Georgia has a rarity in today’s realm of college football and it’s trying to keep it in mint condition.The fullback position is a dying breed in this era of spread and up-tempo offenses, but the No. 6 Bulldogs (3-1, 2-0 SEC) have two competent bruisers in sophomores Quayvon Hicks and Merritt Hall.Hall started six games and appeared in 12 for the Bulldogs' last season as a redshirt freshman, but felt the effects of the physical position after spraining an ankle against Florida that forced him to miss two games.


 


Alexander Ogletree took over as the starting fullback in Hall’s absence, and continued as the prominent fullback throughout the season.With Ogletree leaving the team for undisclosed reasons at the end of the season, it was thought that Hall would be the starting fullback heading into spring camp, but he lost his job again — this time to Hicks.Hicks, a 6-foot-2, 257-pound back out of Blackshear, Ga., drew high praise from coaches during spring camp and was named the team’s most improved offensive player at the conclusion of camp, as well as the team’s starting fullback.“If you earn the spot, you earn the spot. I respect the coaches’ decision and I wasn’t really frustrated,” Hall said. “Obviously anybody that is competitive, you want to be starting and stuff like that. I was trying to go out to practice everyday knowing what I need to work on and trying to improve on, and I’m sure he was doing the same thing.”Hick’s improvement was showcased in the team’s first three games as he collected 67 yards on eight rushes, and led the way for a rushing attack that averages 209 yards per game.But evidently the Bulldogs thought they could gain more.Against LSU, Georgia used a rotation of Hicks and Hall in an effort to keep their legs fresh and enhance its running game.“It is an ongoing competition. We always want to grade how they did in this game and how they practice throughout the week,” Georgia head coach Mark Richt said. “But I think it’s very good for our fullback position to be splitting time as well. It’s a very physical spot, lot of heavy contact at the fullback position, so I think it’s good to have more than one. We think the world of both of them.”


 


The decision to use both fullbacks came as a result not of a lacking running game, but a lack of conditioning.“It was just something coaches wanted,” Hicks said. “Playing a full game on your own, just like Keith [Marshall] and Todd [Gurley] you gotta be able to come in and have fresh legs. On film there was a lot of times the first couple of games that I wasn’t given my best ability because of my wind, and that’s been another thing we’ve been working on. Just making sure we’re conditioning because that’s probably the hardest thing, just staying in that tip top condition throughout the rest of the season.”Against LSU, the Bulldogs gained 196 yards on the ground, most of which came without Todd Gurley who left in the second quarter with an ankle sprain.Georgia will look to continue this rotation as the season moves on, and has the confidence that both fullbacks can get the job done.“Merritt was a full-time starter a year ago and Quayvon kind of knocked him out of the box throughout the spring and fall practice,” Richt said. “But Merritt’s done well and has done well in the past. It’s not like we’re putting a rookie in there behind Quayvon. We’re putting in a veteran player and he’s a guy we’ve been able to count on in the past. So it’s a good healthy competition and a good rotation we’ve got there to keep the guys fresh.”",Connor Smolensky @ConnorSmo,sports,https://www.redandblack.com/sports/fullbacks-quayvon-hicks-and-merritt-hall-in-ongoing-competition-for/article_33a86516-2a3f-11e3-8139-0019bb30f31a.html

1-Oct-13,"Terry instructor brings diversity to UGA, national marketing professors","Of the 26 male, Hispanic-American marketing professors in the country, one has made his way to the Classic City.Julio Sevilla started working at UGA this fall as an assistant professor in the Terry College of Business.“Overall, I feel very privileged to be a professor because it’s a distinctive opportunity to have an influence in the lives of students,” Sevilla said. “It’s good to be an example for people who are from underrepresented groups. If you have students that come from these groups and see that their professors are like them, they’re more likely to graduate and be encouraged to continue in school. Also, you motivate them to think big. Overall, I feel very lucky to have the chance to mentor students.”


 


Charlotte Mason, the department head of marketing and distribution at Terry, said it was important to find someone that would be effective in the classroom, help fulfill their research mission and have good chemistry with the rest of the department.“He’s very positive and enthusiastic,” Mason said. “His research area overlaps nicely with some other folks here. Everything is off to a fabulous start. I’m thrilled to have him here.”Sevilla’s broad area of expertise is consumer behavior and decision-making. He studies social and environmental cues that affect consumer’s decision-making process when buying a product, such as packaging and product placement. He has written two papers in the process of being published.Sevilla earned a bachelor’s degree in industrial engineering from la Universidad Americana in Managua, Nicaragua in 2005. He moved to Miami and earned a master’s degree in international business from Florida International University in 2008.While earning his master’s degree, one of Sevilla’s professors recommended him to the PhD Project.The Ph.D. Project is a program aimed at getting black Americans, Hispanic Americans and Native Americans to become professors at business schools. The president of the PhD Project, Bernard Milano, said it is important to have diversity in the business world.“Corporate America would like to have a greater diversity because their customer base ... is diverse ... they want to be able to have more perspectives on whatever their business issues are,” Milano said. “The only way that corporations can be diverse is if the student population coming out of college is diverse. Our view is that minority faculty are more likely to attract more minority students.”After becoming involved with the PhD project, Sevilla attended the University of Miami in Florida and earned a doctorate in marketing in 2013.


 


Sevilla teaches three consumer behavior classes and has just moved to Georgia with a wife, an infant and a 6-year-old, so he said he’s been busy settling in. But Sevilla said he likes UGA so far and thinks it is a “good fit.”“It’s different from Miami. It’s a quieter and friendlier environment. Bigger cities can be a little hostile sometimes,” he said. “I really like it because I get the best of both worlds. I can go to [Atlanta] but I can also have the small town environment that I like.”","By Mariana Viera

3-Oct-13,Morehead to champion research support on new national council,"University of Georgia President Jere Morehead will serve a one-year term on a committee to advise the 218-member Association of Public and Land-grant Universities.The Committee of Research Intensive Public Universities is a new committee designed as an advisory board for the association when it needs to make major decisions about issues related to public research universities.“We will bring to this group of men and women some major issues of public research universities,” said Peter McPherson, president of the APLU, “Their first meeting will be in November and they’ll give us their advise and thoughts about them. Plus, I fully expect them to have further ideas as to the type of work APLU should do in advancing public research universities.”


 


McPherson said Morehead’s previous leadership roles were one of the reasons why he was chosen to sit on the 14-person committee, but UGA’s strong research history also made the school a good representative of the association’s whole.“The University of Georgia, as a very strong public university and also a land-grant, has been involved in a whole range of research activities — agriculture and environment, natural resources, sciences,” McPherson said. “Your school is a major research university and of course the president had leadership roles for many years and it was particularly appropriate in my view that President Morehead be on this committee.”This first round of appointed members have staggered terms of one or two years in order to avoid having to appoint an entirely new board every two years. After the first year, all new members will have two-year terms.“I think it speaks to the fact that UGA is emerging as a major research university on the national stage,” said David Lee, UGA’s vice president for research and executive vice president of the UGA Research Foundation.Lee said he hoped the board would be a good forum for sharing best practices related to research as well as perhaps being a voice for funding support from both the federal government and private sectors.“I think it’s important, too, that other issues include encouraging investment in our research universities, including in infrastructure as well as research support,” Lee said. “I think as a group they’re going to be able to make sure that we have the kind of — or at least argue for the kind of — consistent research support that allows for long-term planning. One of the problems that we’ve had, just as an aside, is that funding levels go up and down and it’s really hard to plan when that kind of thing is happening.”Lee said while everyone has to tighten their belts in economically difficult times, he hoped the board would promote support for graduate programs in the STEM areas — science, technology, engineering and math. He said this was a great opportunity for UGA to represent the needs of research-intensive universities as a whole.“I think it’s a really important opportunity for President Morehead to work with other presidents of major land-grant and state universities to address issues affecting the national research enterprise generally,” Lee said. “So, I think it’s a very important opportunity and some of those issues are helping the public and also our elected officials understand the importance of the basic, fundamental research that our academic research universities perform.”

4-Oct-13,Player Likeness: Tennessee tops Georgia in NCAA 14,"This season, football reporter Benjamin Wolk and assistant sports editor Connor Smolensky will play a game of NCAA Football 14 each week mimicking the matchup which Georgia has. This week, they played No. 6 Georgia at Tennessee.Tennessee 42, Georgia 28Connor Smolensky - Assistant sports editor, Tennessee:


 


Alec Shirkey (senior reporter) and I decided to compete in this weekly player likeness series at the beginning of the season, and for the first two weeks, that’s exactly what we did.Ben Wolk, the third football beat writer, begged us to get involved and we felt bad for him so we gave it a go. But on Thursday I was reminded of why it was only Alec and I from the start — Ben just really isn’t that good.Ben received Georgia on a coin flip this week (the superior team), and I played with Tennessee. But it was the superior player, not the team, which came out on top.I was already up 14-0 at halftime and added on another seven in my first possession of the second half before Ben could get into the end zone. If it wasn’t for a last-second (meaningless) touchdown, I would have beaten Ben worse, but the final score ended up as 42-28.I moved the ball at will against his defense, and quarterback Justin Worley, who finished the day 13 of 20 passing for 145 yards and four touchdowns, led the attack. I would have like to get him some more yards, but running back Rajion Neal kept taking them (hate when that happens). Neal ran for 124 yards and a touchdown on 11 carries.More yards could have been gained by the offense if Ben didn’t keep setting me up with excellent field position. Georgia quarterback Aaron Murray was picked off twice by my defense, and Todd Gurley was held to just 38 rushing yards on 12 carries.“Why is your coverage so good?” Wolk said in frustration.To answer your question Ben — a magician never tells his secrets.


 


“Don’t go too hard on me in your article,” said Wolk as the front door shut behind me.Sorry, Ben.Benjamin Wolk - football reporter, GeorgiaConnor will try and tell you he won because of his NCAA dominance.He will try and say it doesn't matter what team he is or what team I am: he will win regardless. And when you look at this matchup in which he was Tennessee and I was Georgia — and he won by two touchdowns — it is easy to believe him.But I can assure you, this is a classic case of a team beating itself. Connor didn't win. I lost.It really came down to the opening possession of the game. I threw an interception on my first third-down chance of the game, and everything unraveled from there.Connor thinks it's his innate play-calling ability. But let's be honest, can any of us really believe that a Jersey-born Jets fan really has any discretion when it comes to play-calling? I certainly can't. After that opening possession, I was down on the scoreboard, and I stupidly got away from the run.


TNCMS.AdManager.render({region: 'fixed-big-ad-bottom-asset', slot: 1, fold: ""below""});


My pass-heavy play-calling didn't stop me from embarrassing Connor in total offense — nearly 100 yards more. But the stat sheet definitely tells my unwillingness to run the ball after dealing with an early Todd Gurley injury.The early interception followed by another childish one shortly after dug me into a deep hole that I could never make up.Shame on me for my poor play, and shame on Connor for thinking he was the reason I lost.",Connor Smolensky and Benjamin Wolk,sports,https://www.redandblack.com/sports/player-likeness-tennessee-tops-georgia-in-ncaa/article_30f47a5c-2d24-11e3-a4d7-0019bb30f31a.html

7-Oct-13,"Alphabet Soup: Delta Zetas have fun with philanthropies, turtles","The University of Georgia chapter of Delta Zeta focuses on fun, philanthropy and turtles.Rachel Jones, a junior psychology major from Lawrenceville, said a part of what makes Delta Zeta unique is the national and local level philanthropies it supports.“Our national philanthropy is the Painted Turtle Camp and it’s a camp in California for children with chronic illnesses,” the philanthropy chair said. “Each week the camp specialized with a certain illness or disease so the camp is completely catered to fit every need they would have. They get to go for one week and pretty much be a normal kid.”


 


She said each year the chapter sponsors a few girls to go to California in the summer and work as counselors.The sorority also supports a local-level philanthropy — the Turtle Grant for the hearing and speech impaired — that stems from national support for hearing and speech impaired organizations such as the Starkey Hearing Foundation.“We keep in contact with any hearing and speech impaired associations, schools and networks,” Jones said. “It’s really cool because we get to follow up with that. Everybody from the chapter gets to see what we’ve helped raise money for.”Jones said the money raised by Wing Bash, an annual event hosted at the DZ house on Milledge Avenue, goes to support the Turtle Grant.She said this year more than 1,100 people attended the 12th annual Wing Bash and ate more than 13,000 wings.“From the rough estimates I’ve gathered, we’ve raised a little over $7,000,” Jones said. “It’s pretty cool because that’s obviously not something an individual person could achieve very easily on [his or her] own. It’s just exciting to know that’s going back to something local.”Katelyn Lewis, a junior public relations major from Thomaston and the PR chair of the Zeta Pi chapter, said the philanthropy speaks to her because of a childhood friend.“Growing up I had a lady I was really close to — my mom’s best friend — and she is deaf and she reads lips and everything for her way of communication,” she said. “She is just awesome and just the way she has dealt with it, I always admire her for it.”


 


Jones said the local and national philanthropies become important even for girls who don’t initially have an attachment to them.“It’s kind of grown to be something that you really care about,” she said. “Even if you didn’t have a personal connection when you came in, you definitely leave with it.”Jones said in addition to a focus on philanthropy, the sorority has a number of other traditions — both serious nationally established rituals and fun chapter traditions — that make it special.She said in chapter every week the girls give out awards — the spirit stick, pat on the back and the support bra.“The spirit stick is DZ-related for good deeds you’ve done or for the good of the chapter, and the pat on the back is just anything, if you won any award on campus or got a good grade,” she said. “And we also do the support bra, which is for girls who might be struggling, or going through a rough time. But it’s kind of goofy because the award is a very large sized [bra].”Lauren Governale, a nursing graduate student from Dacula and the Panhellenic delegate for the Zeta Pi chapter, said the sorority holds their mascot in high esteem.“We are the turtles. We take our turtles very seriously,” she said. “Our president actually has pet turtles.”The Zeta Pi president, McKenzie Teschner, was unavailable for comment.


TNCMS.AdManager.render({region: 'fixed-big-ad-bottom-asset', slot: 1, fold: ""below""});


Governale said the sorority also draws a lot of traditions from its founders.“There were six founders so we do everything in sixes, I guess is one of our traditions,” Governale said. “We have Facebook pages for our founders and stuff.”The girls also do a Tacky Christmas date night every year that they often prepare for months in advance and a Paddle Pass.“For paddle pass, the Little makes the Big a paddle and they get together with all of the Big’s good friends and make a skit about [the Big],” Lewis said. “It’s theatrical and funny.”Lewis said she joined DZ because she felt an immediate connection.“Going from high school I didn’t come here with a lot of friends from high school, so I saw my friends from high school in the girls when I met them,” she said. “I could see myself getting along with them and being myself and stuff.”Governale said she enjoys the sorority and living in the house because there isn’t any drama.“I like to think that we’re the down to earth sorority on campus,” she said. “We just all get along. There is no drama. You’d think living in a house with 60 girls, it would be insane, but honestly living in the house has been one of my favorite things.”

She said she was not originally sure she wanted to join a sorority, but she continuously enjoyed the DZ girls and had a connection because her mother was a member.“I came through rush not sure if I wanted to join a sorority. I told myself I was going to be open-minded. I could not imagine my college experience without the experiences I’ve had with Delta Zeta,” she said. “I would be a much more boring person.”Editor's note: Alphabet Soup is a weekly series that examines the most important symbols, rituals and values of Greek organizations on UGA's campus.

9-Oct-13,Fraternity 'Rape-Bait' email exemplifies modern misogyny,"It seems that the men of Georgia Tech’s Phi Kappa Tau fraternity don’t know how to dance.Apparently this year’s pledge class is socially awkward to the point that they need to receive email reminders of how to properly take advantage of intoxicated girls. Entitled “Luring Your Rape-Bait,” the email sent by an established member of the Alpha Rho chapter divulges brotherly advice best summarized in the soon-to-be-infamous “7 E’s of HOOKING UP!”:“1. Encounter (spot a girl or group of girls) 2. Engage (go up and talk to them) 3. Escalate (ask them to dance, or ask them to go up to your room or find a couch, depending on what kind of party) 4. Erection (GET HARD) 5. Excavate (should be self-explanatory) 6. E-------e (should also be self explanatory) 7. Expunge (send them out of your room and on their way out when you are finished. IF ANYTHING EVER FAILS, GO GET MORE ALCOHOL.”


 


His concern for the future of his fraternity is admirable — really. He reassures the young men that he is sharing his expertise in order to see them succeed at future social gatherings. And this version of success, which is dangerously similar to sexual assault, apparently lies contingent upon a man’s ability to fill a pretty girl with cheap alcohol then dry hump her in public under the pretenses of “dancing.”Remember, as he assures his brothers, “DANCING IS FUN!!!!! Always try to dance.”Campus police and Tech’s Interfraternity Council are looking into the conduct of the sender and the rest of the chapter, but the damage has already been done.Not only has another batch of young men been instructed that women are objects for nothing more than sexual pleasure, there are countless women who have been “baited” by men like this before.But there is good that can come from such a blatant display of cheap comedy and sinister intentions. While Phi Kappa Tau's tactics are nothing new, the national attention that has been drawn to the incident further emphasizes the need for a cultural shift away from this type of hate speech, which often goes overlooked.If you don’t find the email frightening, you should. This unofficial handbook for objectifying and abusing women is a manifestation of decades of misogyny — further perpetuated by mere slaps on the wrists for the brutish men who are openly supportive of such practices. Even “comic” sidenotes on a fraternity listserv should no longer be tolerated.This is definitely not the first instance of testosterone-fueled women-hating, but there is no reason it can’t be the last.—Laura Thompson is the views editor for The Red & Black

9-Oct-13,Six incidences of fake ticket sales reported so far this football season,"Timothy Huban did not worry about the legitimacy of the scalper when he spent $400 to be denied entry into Sanford Stadium.“It was just right out front of [the stadium],” he said. “It looked like the person was buying and selling tickets, so it didn’t really cross my mind that they would be counterfeit.”Six incidents of football fans buying fake tickets from scalpers — including Huban’s  — were reported to University of Georgia police during the 2013 home football games.


 


Collectively, victims have lost roughly $2,170 purchasing fraudulent tickets, according to these reports. The 2013 UGA game versus Louisiana State University alone saw 87 percent of this money lost to fake ticket sales.“This goes on every year,” said UGA Police Chief Jimmy Williamson. “If the event’s huge, there’s people out there selling tickets, and if you don’t go to someone you know, or a legitimate vendor, you will more than likely get taken advantage of.”The number of incidents reported for home games in 2012 was lower, but UGA police responded to one incident involving a victim paying for $440 in fake tickets.Williamson said many incidents of this nature go unreported.According to an article by the University of Missouri student newspaper The Maneater, roughly 400 tickets were read as “missed scans” on the day of the UGA-Mizzou football game in 2012.The cause of many of these fraudulent ticket sales is the accuracy and detail of the fake tickets when compared to real tickets.“There are some distinct differences between valid, authentic tickets and what’s being sold,” said Tim Cearley, director of ticket operations for the UGA Athletic Association. “But they’re doing a pretty good job out there of coming close to what we and other schools are selling.”Certain characteristics of the real tickets could not be disclosed to The Red & Black for fear of scalpers replicating these qualities, but there is a distinct design on the ticket used to benefit game attendants.


 


“The biggest thing that is on our tickets is a custom foil, and within that foil, it says Georgia Bulldogs and it’s got the trademark ‘G’ in it,” he said. “That’s primarily the identifier that we have in place that cannot be duplicated. What we’re seeing on the counterfeit tickets is, on where that custom foil is, the counterfeiters are using more generic foil type, and most of these are obviously being sold or purchased on the street.”This does not stop fans, particularly non-regular attendees, from falling victim to these purchases.“The one-time fan who is just coming to that game isn’t familiar to what our ticket looks like, so to the untrained eye, it looks and feels like a genuine ticket,” Cearley said.Huban, whose attendance marked his third trip to a UGA football game ever, said he and his friend, who had attended several games, were both fooled by the tickets’ appearance.“My son and his friend said that they did seem a little bit weird, but I have an alumni friend, and I showed him the ticket,” Huban said. “He took it and looked at it, and it looked to him like a legitimate ticket. He couldn’t tell, and he’s been a previous season ticket holder.”The threat of fake tickets is combined with the increased risk of counterfeit money.Williamson said the number of incident counterfeit money is “about 50-50” with the number of fraudulent tickets sold.“If the deal sounds too good, it probably is,” Williamson said. “If someone is offering you $50 a piece for a game that nobody wants to see, you’re getting fake money. The same thing goes for something like the LSU game — if there are tickets on the 50-yard line for face value, they’re fake tickets.”


TNCMS.AdManager.render({region: 'fixed-big-ad-bottom-asset', slot: 1, fold: ""below""});


During the 2012 football season, five separate reports of victims receiving fake money for real tickets came to UGA police’s attention, a series that totaled in the exchange of hundreds of counterfeit dollars.Due to the busy schedule for police on Gameday, Williamson said there is not enough service, and the situation is not severe enough, to stop every scalper and counterfeit money dealer in Athens on any given Saturday.“Right now, with everything going on, we haven’t had a large enough problem to divert those types of resources to that type of operation,” he said.","Brad Mannion

9-Oct-13,"Despite shutdown, UGA research continues 'until we can't do it anymore'","When the national government shut down on Oct. 1, science research-related agencies across the country ground to a halt as 800,000 federal employees were furloughed.The University of Georgia’s Office of the Vice President for Research issued an announcement on Sept. 30, instructing UGA researchers working on federally funded projects to continue research as usual.“What we said in that memo hasn’t changed,” said Regina Smith, associate vice president for research. “We’ve instructed our faculty to proceed with their projects as usual. Continue working, continue working. That seems to be, from our conversations with other research universities in the state of Georgia and with other SEC schools, we’re all doing pretty much the same thing. Business as usual.”


 


Smith said UGA has formed a small committee to consider what to do if the government continues to not issue money for research. She said when an investigator receives a federal grant, UGA pays them for their work and is reimbursed by the grant provider at the end of the month.“Right now what’s happening is, they’re not reimbursing us,” Smith said. “So the only money we have to spend is University money and we’re continuing to do that. But stop and think, University money can only go so far.”UGA researchers brought in a total of $104,501,189 in federally sponsored awards for the 2013 fiscal year. But big-name agencies including the United States Department of Agriculture and the National Institute of Health are running on skeleton crews because they have stopped receiving money from Congress.“We are starting to see that payouts to agencies are being limited or are not happening,” said Andrew Dill, UGA’s director of federal relations. “And I think review of grants are being limited or are not happening because of the continued furloughing of employees. Congress has tried to do some piecemeal funding of certain agencies like NIH, which have not been successful.”OVPR has advised researchers to continue submitting grants according to pre-shutdown deadlines, even if there’s no one on the receiving end, Smith said. The proposals must still have the correct electronic time stamp to be valid.Smith said UGA would stop work promptly on any federally funded project if instructed to by an agency, but has only received three stop-work orders so far. Smith said she wasn’t aware of the details but stop-work orders are typically associated with contract workers, not grant-sponsored researchers.UGA adjunct professors and students who are employed at local stations of national agencies like the USDA and the Environmental Protection Agency were cut off from research projects when the doors closed.Many of those researchers were unavailable for comment because, as federal employees, they needed permission from their agencies to speak to The Red & Black, but their press officers had been furloughed as well.


 


“I’ve been working with Congress,” Dill said. “Just trying to get them to understand the impact that it’s having on the state and on UGA and trying to see what they can come up with as far as a deal goes.”With Oct. 8 marking the beginning of the second week of the shut down, UGA has hunkered down for the long haul.“We will continue to do that research until we can’t do it anymore,” Smith said.","Jeanette Kazmierczak

10-Oct-13,Designated Dawgs needs a new home base,"Students face the issue of figuring out how they will get home after a night downtown every weekend.Luckily, the University of Georgia has in place a free safe ride system that allows students to do just that. Designated Dawgs, UGA’s student volunteer safe ride program, provides safe, non-judgmental rides home from the downtown area. As of Oct. 7, Designated Dawgs has provided 74,431 safe rides home from downtown Athens.“We offer rides to anyone in the Athens community. We will not, however, provide a ride to anyone who is unable to walk themselves to the car or who has thrown up before getting into the car because of health concerns,” said Sarah Hughes, executive director of Designated Dawgs.


 


Any individual needing a ride home from downtown for whatever reason can call Designated Dawgs, or find its table outside the Fred building downtown, and they would receive a free ride home from Designated Dawgs.Designated Dawgs called the Fred building home for the past 10 years, until now.The building was a donation, therefore the organization hasn’t had to pay rent for about 10 years. Recently, the group was issued a three weeks notice to vacate the building and is now looking for a new space to move operations to.“Designated Dawgs is vital to the community. UGA no longer has an escort van for students, therefore whether a student needs a ride home from the library or a ride home from a party, Designated Dawgs’ services are more important than ever,"" said Patrick Klibanoff, a senior from Norcross majoring in finance, international business and public relations. ""If Designated Dawgs can no longer provide its services, the community will be more at risk.""Most people are unaware that Designated Dawgs will also provide a ride home to individuals even if he or she is not downtown, although it may take longer for the ride to get there. What Designated Dawgs will not do though is provide rides from apartments or homes to downtown. Designated Dawgs was an idea conceived by Terry College of Business graduate Tim McNary. As a graduate from the University, McNary was familiar with the challenges students faced in getting home safely from downtown whether they were studying or socializing. McNary based his idea off of a similar program in place at Texas A&M University. The Designated Dawgs was implemented after a visit to observe how the program would work, and it provided its first ride in 2001.“Once a semester Designated Dawgs hosts ‘Rider Appreciation’ weekends. Along with a free ride, Designated Dawgs will give out a goodie bag filled with candy, Ramen, a water bottle and Advil for the next day. It shows that they actually care about the people who use their services,” said Hadley Dreibelbis, a senior from Valdosta majoring in public relations, international affairs and political science.Designated Dawgs will be hosting a percentage night Thursday at Dirty Birds to raise money so that it can continue to provide services to the Athens community. Individuals wishing to help out can visit the restaurant during regular dinner hours. Designated Dawgs will receive 10 percent of all the funds raised that night. The organization is collaborating with the University Law School later in the semester to provide rides home from one of its events. The money raised during the percentage night will first go toward the law school event, with any unused funds going toward finding a new venue to base the program out of.

10-Oct-13,Abbey Road LIVE! celebrates John Lennon's birthday,"Beatlemania has struck Athens at the Georgia Theatre.Athens-based Abbey Road LIVE! is performing an All-Star Jamboree celebrating the birthday of the Beatles’ front-man John Lennon at the Georgia Theatre Thursday night. Heavily focusing on Lennon’s material and adding some songs from his solo career, the cover band is commemorating what would have been the musician’s 73rd birthday.Initially a part of an original band called Fuzzy Sprouts in the ’90s, members Andrew Hanmer, Dave Domizi and Michael Wegner re-formed as Abbey Road LIVE! after the dissolution of the group.


 


“We decided to do something a little different for one of our shows, so we learned the entire ‘Abbey Road’ album,” said Michael Wegner, guitarist, keyboardist, clarinetist and vocals, of his time in Fuzzy Sprouts.It was well received by the crowd, as well as a lot of fun, so the success formed the basis of the cover band Abbey Road LIVE!. Initially a tribute to ""Abbey Road,"" the group broadened its scope of material to songs and albums from all eras of the Beatles. Wegner explained that the Beatles strongly influenced all of them since they were kids.“For me, it became my working model for learning to play music. They had the perfect songs, harmonies and lyrics,” Wegner said.The band’s first shows were at the Georgia Theatre, and the John Lennon birthday celebration has become an almost annual tradition at the venue the group considers home. The first of these celebrations was in 1997 while the members were still a part of Fuzzy Sprouts. In 2001 or 2002, it was brought back as an annual show.“Back then, we were only playing a few shows a year, so we tended to schedule them on special occasions,” Wegner said.This year has been a busy one for Abbey Road LIVE!, which kicked off with double album shows featuring “Rubber Soul” and “Revolver” around the Southeast.This year’s birthday celebration is going to be even bigger than those in the past. The band has been collaborating with musicians from other Athens bands to create the All-Star Jamboree show on Thursday. Some special guests include Mike Mantione from Five Eight, Jason NeSmith from Casper and the Cookies, Chris McKay from The Critical Darlings and singer/song writer Caroline Aiken.There are a few more surprise performances in store


 


“It's going to be a crazy show, at one point we will have six or seven guitarists on stage, plus some horn players,” Wegner said.Everyone wants to know a band member's favorite song, but every fan knows there’s no simple way to answer that question with merely one song — sometimes even two or three.“That's never a fair question, there are so many great ones,"" Wegner said. ""I'm partial to the George Harrison material — ‘Here Comes The Sun’ and ‘While My Guitar Gently Weeps.’ The songs that are the most fun to play are the ones that everyone sings along with like ‘All You Need Is Love,’ ‘Hey Jude’ and ‘Twist and Shout’... Really this list could go on and on.”","Samantha Lipkin

10-Oct-13,Unlimited meal plan encourages college obesity,"Forty percent of children in the state of Georgia are overweight. Our childhood obesity rate is second in the country. The ""Freshmen 15"" is not a myth for most students. According to the American College Health Association, college obesity jumped from 27 percent in 2009 to 29 percent in 2011.I know I gained a few inches — particularly around the middle — eating bowls of tatter tots and those amazing pizzas at ECV. The cookies, cakes, frozen yogurt and array of cereals didn't help either. I weighed myself right before summer started; my BMI was in the overweight category, and it was frighteningly easy to get there.
As a freshman, I spent $3,956 for my 7-day meal plan. That's roughly $18 a day or $6 a meal (assuming you're going three times a day); and while they may sound extremely reasonable, you need to think about what you would be eating instead.



 


I'm a Kroger shopper. I buy a pack of six frozen chicken breasts for $9 every week. I also buy lettuce ($5), and a pack of bleu cheese crumbles every other week ($5). I buy a bottle of olive oil ($8) and a bottle of balsamic vinegar ($4) once every two months. As you might have guessed, I love my chicken salads. I will eat them for lunch and dinner every night of the week. As my roommates suggest, this is a pretty lavish meal for any particular—poor—college student. But really, I am spending roughly $1.50 per salad. And don't let me be misunderstood, these are some hearty salads. I fill up a salad bowl no problem and will put away a good four ounces of chicken.I would never just have eaten a salad like this in the dining hall, though. I would have needed some mac and cheese, maybe some fries, one of those amazing yeast rolls. But I wouldn't have stopped there; if there were chocolate chip cookies, I was in. God forbid they had those insane double fudge cookies, I was done for.The meal plan is conducive to these kinds of choices. There isn't a “pay as you go” option, so anything and everything is fair game. My friends and I would fill up our trays without considering that we weren't all that hungry, and we would sometimes get up for more.
At home I eat that salad, and I'm good to go. I may steal an Oreo or two from my roommate, but I'm not searching for three desserts like I was last year. If I had had to pay as I ate last year, I would have made my yummy salads and had a cookie. I would have had to abide by my limits. 
As much as I detest Auburn on game days, they have very cool meal plan options. They have a ""pay as you go"" plan where every food item is individually priced. They can charge it to their university cards as part of a meal plan, but it is the most cost and health effective option.  McGill University in Montreal also has fun perks to their plans. They provide tupperware containers for those on the meal plan so the students can take the food back to their dorms. Being able to take the food with them provides a sense of food security; they won't have to run back to the dining hall later to grab a quick bite, and they don't need to overeat now to compensate for no food later.  


 


It would truly be in students' best interest to allow more option for meal plans. Those on the meal plan have a lot of food available to them, but more isn't always better.  The university is so proud to let the “big dawg eat,” but the only thing we have to show for it is our growing waistlines.  —Megan Smith is a sophomore from Alpharetta majoring in journalism","Megan Smith

17-Oct-13,First vice president for academic affairs and provost candidate discusses importance of innovation,"Pamela S. Whitten wants to make sure University of Georgia students’ learning changes as fast as their world does.“Those of us who work in these institutions have to recognize that the landscape is changing,” Whitten said. “And we have to have the energy and the intellectual and analytical chops to think in bold ways to really transition our universities into the next generation.”Whitten, one of the four candidates up for the position of UGA’s next senior vice president for academic affairs and provost, discussed her qualifications for the position and her plans for creating an innovative learning environment at the Chapel Thursday afternoon.


 


The senior vice president for academic affairs and provost is the chief academic officer and chief operating officer who will report directly to UGA President Jere Morehead.Whitten said as provost she would also focus on transitioning UGA into the future.“Students and young people expect to learn in different ways now,” she said. “We need to provide those opportunities and experiences for them. We need to make sure that students at the University of Georgia have the world at their feet.”Whitten said this new learning environment can best be strengthened through internships, study abroad opportunities and giving undergraduates the chance to do their own research.She also stressed relationships are key to student success.“If the heart of the institution is the students, then the soul of this institution is the faculty,” Whitten said. “I think it’s so important to create a forum of students and faculty who are able to communicate and tell each other what’s going on. I think it’s so much more than just getting feedback.”The provost, she said, should also create constant communication with the faculty.“A provost has to work in a true and sincere partnership and relationship with the President,” Whitten said. “So that they are able to think in bold and exciting ways in terms of moving forward. I think it’s really important to forge strong partnerships with deans and directors as well.”


 


Whitten has served as the dean of the Michigan State University College of Communication Arts and Sciences for the past five years. She is known for her work in the field of telemedicine, focusing on the use of technology in health care, with an interest in telehealth.Whitten earned her bachelor’s degree in management from Tulane University, her master’s degree in organizational communication from the University of Kentucky and her doctoral degree in health communication from the University of Kansas.But Whitten said it was her experience working in an American bank overseas that prepared her for leadership positions such as provost.“Prior to coming to Michigan State, I had the opportunity to have a couple of very interesting, very life-changing experiences, all of which I think prepared me to transition to the next level of leadership,” she said.Whitten’s prepared to expand UGA’s reputation to those overseas places that shaped her.“I think it’s important to lead in ways to actually build inside the University, to really make this a destination place for students and faculty from around the world to want to come,” Whitten said. “I think the provost needs to bring out the very best of the faculty’s academic leadership that truly reflects the heart of the institution.”The next visiting provost candidate, José Luis Bermúdez, dean of the Texas A&M University College of Liberal Arts, will give his presentation Oct. 21 from 9:30 a.m. to 10:30 a.m at the Chapel.",Lauren McDonald,uganews,https://www.redandblack.com/uganews/first-vice-president-for-academic-affairs-and-provost-candidate-discusses/article_1094ef06-3785-11e3-8b28-0019bb30f31a.html
19-Oct-13,"UGA students face debt, but it could be worse","The average University of Georgia graduate with debt faces a $18,589 bill — and that's really not so bad, according to the Institute for College Access and Success.In fact, UGA graduates tend to pay about $2,000 less than the statewide averages for public four-year universities, according to the Institute, which obtained the data from the United States Department of Education Common Data Set and Peterson's Undergraduate Financial Aid and Undergraduate Databases.Nationally, Student debt surpassed $1.2 trillion as of May 2013, according to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Georgia falls at about the midpoint of a list of statewide student debt averages.


 


The Institute's list shows students in Georgia accrue less debt on average — $20,479 — than the national average of $23,065 for public universities.Even among the cadre of colleges in the southeast with lottery-funded scholarships similar to the HOPE Scholarship — Tennessee, South Carolina and Florida — Georgia performs well at bridling student debt.Georgia scores a couple hundred dollars above Tennessee and Florida. Students in debt from Tennessee and Florida schools owe an average of $20,258 and $20,211, respectively, according to the list. And Georgia ranks far below South Carolina's $25,376 average.Debt has increased at a rapid pace. From 2006 to 2007, average debt decreased by $77 at UGA. The next year, from 2007 to 2008, average debt increased by $423. From 2008 to 2009, however, debt spiked to $1,172. By 2011, average debt exploded by a rate of $2,631.""Generally factors that contribute to rising student debt are the decline of state funding for public colleges and universities, which has pushed up tuition and fees, and the rise of state merit-based aid programs, which don't take need into account,"" wrote Claire Suggs, senior education policy analyst at the Georgia Budget and Policy Institute in an email to The Red & Black.The prevalence of debt is another measure of college affordability. The fraction of students who graduate from Georgia public institutions with debt is 56 percent, a sliver under the national average of 57 percent. But attending UGA lowers a student's chance of accumulating debt by 10 percent, according to the Institute.Georgia's middling numbers reflect low private borrowing. Only 1 percent of freshmen at UGA take out bank loans, the data shows. That reduces debt, said Matthew Riggins, president of the Student Financial Planning Association.""The biggest piece of advice I could give is to stay away from private loans if possible,"" said Riggins, a senior financial planning major from Lavonia.


 


He insisted private loans should only serve as a ""last resort"" when other means, such as federal loans and grants, dry up. Unlike private financing, the federal government offers repayment plans that can relieve some of the pressure felt by graduates squeezed by expensive bills and poor employment prospects.The ""Pay as You Earn Repayment Plan"" allows low earners to adjust their repayment plan to a fixed 10 percent of discretionary income. Under the plan, the government forgives outstanding debt after 20 years.With federal loans, borrowers can often work with their ""loan servicers"" — who send the monthly bill — to adjust payment options, Riggins said. Other programs offer special breaks to teachers, service members and Peace Corps members.Federal subsidized and unsbsidized loans offer lower rates than in the private market, Riggins said. Parents with good credit can take out cheaper loans, but without the same repayment flexibility.Parents and students should look at their options together,"" Riggins said. ""There's no one-size-fits-all option.""","Emily Kopp

19-Oct-13,Georgia/Vanderbilt: First-half rewind,"NASHVILLE, Tenn. — No. 15 Georgia faced off against SEC East foe Vanderbilt on Saturday at Vanderbilt Stadium in chilly, wet conditions. The Bulldogs were once again without starting running back Todd Gurley who was listed as questionable coming into the contest.Georgia got scoring underway early with a field goal, and it was a back-and-forth first half from there. Both teams scored in unconventional ways: Vanderbilt punched in a 3-yard run with its kicker on a fake field goal and Georgia's Shaq Wiggins returned an interception for a touchdown — the Bulldogs' first defensive touchdown of the season. Georgia leads Vanderbilt 24-14 at the halfway point.Both teams suffered their own losses in the first half. Georgia's Josh Harvey-Clemons went down with a foot injury and Vanderbilt's quarterback Austyn Carta-Samuels also left the game with a leg injury. Perhaps the most confusing loss of the game, though, was the Bulldogs' Ray Drew earning a targeting penalty — and ejection — following a hit on Carta-Samuels. 


 


PLAYER OF THE HALFBrendan DouglasNo one on either side sported a jaw-dropping stat line in the opening half, but Georgia's freshman running back Brendan Douglas paved the way for the Bulldogs' offense with some hard-nosed downfield running in the first half. On Georgia's 8-play, 53-yard touchdown drive in the opening quarter, Douglas carried the ball four times for 41 yards, breaking several tackles on one carry down to the 1-yard line. Aaron Murray punched in a touchdown run on the next play. By the end of the half, Douglas had rushed seven times for 52 yards.PLAY OF THE HALFShaq Wiggins interception return for touchdownThere were a handful of mentionable plays in the opening half, particularly Ray Drew's targeting, Vanderbilt's fake field goal for a touchdown and the Bulldogs' fourth-down touchdown late in the second quarter. But it was Georgia's first defensive touchdown of the season that set the tone for the first half. Vanderbilt lined up in an unfamiliar formation with only three offensive linemen in front of Commodore quarterback Carta-Samuels. With the other linemen lined up out left, and a wide receiver behind them, Carta-Samuels tossed a screen pass to his receiver. Wiggins anticipated the play from the snap, jumping in front of the Commodore receiver and intercepting the pass. He bobbled the ball slightly at first, but regained possession and took it back to the end zone to give the Bulldogs a 17-14 lead, which they later extended.INTERESTING STAT12,233 yards


 


In the first quarter of action, Aaron Murray completed a 7-yard pass to tight end Arthur Lynch for what appeared to be a relatively insignificant play. For Murray, though, the completion marked an SEC record-setting moment. With the 7-yard pass, Murray's total offensive yards totaled 12,233 yards in his career, which passed former Florida quarterback Tim Tebow on the SEC's all-time list for most career yards of offense.HALFTIME STATSGeorgia

But a Damian Swann muffed punt, a costly 15-yard penalty by Ramik Wilson after a fourth-down stop and a botched snap on a Collin Barber punt created another exciting late-game environment for a Bulldog team that has seen its fair share of last-minute wins and losses this season.


TNCMS.AdManager.render({region: 'fixed-big-ad-bottom-asset', slot: 1, fold: ""below""});


This time, unlike in the South Carolina, LSU and Tennessee games, the Bulldogs were unable to get the late-game outcome they wanted. After that aforementioned botched snap on the Barber punt, Vanderbilt was able to rush in for a score on the ensuing play to give the Commodores their first lead of the second half. Georgia's next drive ended quickly when freshman running back Brendan Douglas fumbled after catching an Aaron Murray pass. The turnover eliminated any hope for the Bulldogs to come back, adding yet another loss to an SEC slate that still has Florida, Auburn and Kentucky left on the schedule.",BENJAMIN WOLK,sports,https://www.redandblack.com/sports/instant-recap-vanderbilt-overcomes-second-half-deficit-defeats-georgia/article_b396d8a2-38db-11e3-8c7b-001a4bcf6878.html
19-Oct-13,"Vanderbilt outscores Georgia 17-0 in final quarter, wins 31-27","NASHVILLE, Tenn. — Brendan Douglas’ post-game interview said it all.The freshman running back himself didn’t say much, but the anguish on his face as he fielded questions from the media about his fourth-quarter fumble portrayed just how heart-wrenching Georgia’s 31-27 loss to Vanderbilt was. He knew there was a multitude of moments throughout the SEC East contest that helped decide the outcome, but his fumble as the Bulldogs’ attempted to make one final push to retake the lead finalized a dreadful fourth quarter for Georgia (4-3, 3-2 SEC).Douglas, just barely, uttered one short phrase.


 


“It’s hard,” he said.The loss was particularly difficult for the Bulldogs considering how the first three quarters panned out.With 19 seconds to go in the third quarter, Georgia led Vanderbilt 27-14 and the Bulldogs were set to return a punt to regain possession heading into the final quarter. Then, a chain of unfortunate — and untimely — Georgia miscues changed the entire dynamic of what seemed to be a Bulldog-controlled contest.Georgia’s Damian Swann backpedaled to get in position to field the Commodores’ punt, but mishandled it and Vanderbilt (4-3, 1-3 SEC) fell on it to take over at the Georgia 36-yard-line to start the final quarter of play.“The wind caught it and started pushing it further away from me,” Swann said. “I’m a player; I should have caught it.”The momentum swing that followed was an obvious one, but even so, the Bulldogs’ managed to force three quick stops to force Vanderbilt head coach James Franklin to decide whether to go for it on fourth down or to kick a field goal to make it a 10-point game.Franklin bravely chose the former, leading to mayhem as Vanderbilt lined up for what many considered to be an outcome-deciding fourth-and-4 try at the Bulldogs’ 30-yard line.Vanderbilt backup quarterback Patton Robinette targeted wide receiver Jonathan Krause across the middle, but Georgia linebacker Ramik Wilson delivered a ferocious hit that jarred the ball from Krause’s grasp. For a moment, the Bulldog sideline erupted. Players and coaches — both on the field and the sideline — congratulated each other on a much-needed stop on fourth down.Then came a dreaded yellow flag from an official, and all parties involved already knew the result — a 15-yard penalty to extend the Vanderbilt drive.“That play that they called that penalty on Ramik, that’s the play that we thought we had the game won,” freshman cornerback Shaq Wiggins said. “We stopped them on fourth down. We’re going to get our offense back on the field; we’re up by 13. With that stop, we thought we basically settled things.”Six plays later, Robinette punched in a 2-yard touchdown run that made the Commodores’ potential come-from-behind victory significantly more realistic.But even then, the Bulldogs remained in control with a six-point lead, which was cut to three with just under five minutes to play. Unfortunately for Georgia, though, the Bulldogs’ offense stalled once again, going three-and-out for the third-consecutive possession.Then, Georgia’s special teams miscues, which have been emphasized all season, finally happened in a moment when the Bulldogs couldn’t afford it. Punter Collin Barber was unable to handle a high-snap — a recurring trend on punts and kicks this season — and was forced to fall on the ball deep in Bulldog territory.“Anytime you turn it over or make a mistake like that, you expect that it will cost you,” Georgia head coach Mark Richt said.As Vanderbilt running back Jerron Seymour ran for a 13-yard touchdown on the ensuing play, Georgia knew that another desperation drive would be necessary to earn a win.But this time, partially due to Douglas’ fumble, the effort came up short, capping off a 17-0 fourth quarter for Vanderbilt as the Commodores won their first home game against Georgia since 1991 and handed the Bulldogs their second-straight SEC loss.“It’s a tough game; it’s a physical game,” Richt said. “It’s a game when you’re winning everybody’s wants to say how good things are going. And then, when you start losing, people are going to have an opinion on that too.”",BENJAMIN WOLK,sports,https://www.redandblack.com/sports/football/vanderbilt-outscores-georgia---in-final-quarter-wins/article_2d3fc6ec-3917-11e3-9b7c-001a4bcf6878.html
19-Oct-13,Football notebook: Secondary has first multi-turnover game,"NASHVILLE, Tenn. — Georgia’s 31-27 loss to Vanderbilt was a letdown, but there was one bright spot for the Bulldogs.No. 15 Georgia’s (4-3, 3-2 SEC) secondary, which before Saturday only had one interception on the year, was able to pick of Vanderbilt (4-3, 1-3) quarterbacks twice in Nashville.With a 14-10 lead in the second quarter, Vanderbilt lined up six players to the left side in a group formation, while leaving three linemen to block for quarterback the quarterback and running back.


 


Commodores’ quarterback Austyn Carta-Samuels threw a screen pass to one of his six wideouts before freshman cornerback Shaq Wiggins picked the ball off and ran it 39 yards for a touchdown.“I think I’ve seen it on film maybe once or twice but I kind of knew it was coming. That was kind of the only play they could have ran so I just read it before those big guys could get a hand on it.”Georgia head coach Mark Richt credits Wiggins’ speed as the reason why he was able to get his hands on the ball.“If you read it quick enough and see it coming normally you want to get in the position to make a tackle, but if you get a good enough read on it go get it, and Shaq is an extremely quick guy,” he said.That’s the one thing we saw in his high school tape, just how quickly he can change direction and go from zero to full speed. He saw it coming, broke in front of it, still have to catch it when you get there. How many times do you see guys get there and the ball hits the ground because they don’t catch it? He caught it and took the ball to the house. Huge momentum play for us at the time.”Junior safety Corey Moore, like Wiggins, collected the first interception of his career in the third quarter of Saturday’s matchup, but this time against back-up quarterback Patton Robinette who was filling in for an injured Carta-Samuels.“I think they were in wildcat and the dude threw it out there to the running back and the running back fumble with the ball and I just took it and I was just happy it was my first pick. Thank God,” Moore said.Georgia will look to carry some of this slight defensive momentum when it travels to Jacksonville, Fla., to take on Florida in two weeks. 


 


Injury bug continuesGeorgia may have two more names added to an already laundry list like injury report following Saturday’s contest.Sophomore safety Josh Harvey-Clemons injured his right foot on a tackle in the second quarter and was eventually ruled out for the rest of the game, while junior wide receiver Chris Conley was seen rolling around on the ground after Georgia’s last Hail Mary play.The extent of each injury is unknown, but Conley was seen on crutches leaving the stadium with a brace around his right ankle.Both players were helped off the field by Georgia trainers with their respective injuries.“I don’t know what’s up with Josh, he was out for the rest of the game,” Richt said. “Chris needed help getting off the field so that’s never a good time.”Conley is Georgia’s leading receiver this season with 418 yards and four touchdowns on 30 catches, while Harvey-Clemons is the Bulldogs’ third leading tackler 37 this season.If significantly injured the pair will join freshman safety Tray Matthews (hamstring), sophomores Todd Gurley (ankle), Keith Marshall (knee), Justin Scott-Wesley (knee) and juniors Michael Bennett (knee) and Malcolm Mitchell (knee) as Georgia starters who have missed time this year.

Rumph dresses out, doesn't playWith all the injuries at wide receiver, many expected JUCO transfer wide receiver Jonathon Rumph to get his first action of the season.He sat out the first six games nursing a hamstring injury, but coaches indicated this week they anticipated Rumph would earn playing time against Vanderbilt on Saturday. Commodores' head coach James Franklin even name-dropped Rumph in his weekly press conference, indicating the 6-foot-5 receiver as one of Georgia's biggest potential threats.However, Rumph didn't see the field on Saturday, though he did dress out and participate in pre-game warmups. By not playing Rumph, despite his apparent repaired hamstring, the question now is whether or not the coaches will choose to burn his redshirt.Richt didn't comment on the redshirt status of Rumph, instead suggesting that he wasn't certain whether or not the wide receiver had gotten playing time.""I don't know if he got in or not,"" Richt said. ""I'll have to ask [wide receiver] coach [Tony] Ball about it.""In two seasons at Holmes Community College in Mississippi, Rumph caught 87 passes for 1,347 and seven touchdowns.",CONNOR SMOLENSKY & BENJAMIN WOLK,sports,https://www.redandblack.com/sports/football-notebook-secondary-has-first-multi-turnover-game/article_79454a9c-3937-11e3-9d7e-001a4bcf6878.html
19-Oct-13,Georgia/Vanderbilt: Game rewind,"NASHVILLE, Tenn. — Georgia got outscored 17-0 in the fourth quarter to suffer its second-straight loss to a Southeastern Conference opponent against Vanderbilt on Saturday. After going into halftime with a 24-14 lead, the No. 15 Bulldogs (4-3, 3-2 SEC) struck first in the second half with a 23-yard Marshall Morgan field goal to put them up 13. The following possession junior safety Corey Moore picked off Vanderbilt (4-3, 1-3) backup quarterback Patton Robinette for his first career interception. Georgia failed to make anything of the turnover, going three-and-out before punting it back to the Commodores. The Bulldogs’ defense continued its strong play forcing a Vanderbilt three-and-out until their special teams’ woes awoke as they have so often this season. Junior cornerback and punter returner Damian Swann muffed a Taylor Hudson punt, handing the ball back to the Commodores at Georgia’s 36-yard line to end the third quarter.That was just the beginning of Georgia’s costly mistakes. On the drive following the muffed punt, Georgia junior linebacker Ramik Wilson was flagged for a targeting penalty as he hit Commodores’ wide out Jonathan Krause who was coming across the middle of the field on a fourth-and-4 play. The play was later reversed, allowing Wilson to stay in the game, but the penalty stood giving Vanderbilt a first down, leading to Robinette touchdown closing the deficit to 27-21. Following a Georgia punt, Vanderbilt kicker Carey Spear knocked in a 40-yard field goal to place the game within three. Vanderbilt’s momentum increased when Georgia punter Collin Barber couldn’t handle a high snap by long-snapper Trent Frix, resulting in another Georgia turnover, which gave Vanderbilt the ball at Georgia’s 13-yard line. One play later, Commodores’ running back Jerron Seymour punched in what would be the game-winning 13-yard touchdown run. Georgia had 2:53 to make another comeback, but was stalled by a Brendan Douglas fumble.PLAY OF THE GAME: Damian Swann fumble


 


Everything was going right for Georgia. The Bulldogs were up 27-14, their defense was playing well and they had just collected their second interception of the game. But then Swann’s fumble happened, which seemingly turned the game around for Vanderbilt. The Commodores scored on the possession following the fumble, and would score on all but one drive from that point. Vanderbilt caused two turnovers after the fumble, and outscored Georgia 17-0 since that fumble. It may sound repetitive, but that fumble sent the game into frenzy.PLAYER OF THE GAME: Patton RobinetteRedshirt freshman quarterback Patton Robinette was forced to fill in for Vanderbilt starting quarterback Austyn Carta-Samuels when he went down with a knee injury with six minutes left in the second quarter. Robinette filled in nicely for the injured Carta-Samuels going 12-of-20 passing for 111 yards and an interception. Robinette was also effective in the run game carrying the ball nine times for 25 yards and a touchdown. It’s difficult for any freshman to come into a game and perform well, especially against a top-25 team. Robinette led his team to 17 points.INTERESTING STATFreshman cornerback Shaq Wiggins and junior safety Corey Moore both collected their first career interceptions on Saturday. Wiggins returned his interception for 39-yards and a touchdown, while Moore had a one-yard return.FINAL STATSGeorgia:

20-Oct-13,'Awareness' doesn't cure cancer,"The first of October marks the beginning of Breast Cancer Awareness Month and suddenly, the color pink is everywhere. Pink ribbons, pink shirts, pink bumper stickers and even pink hair seem to pop up in the unrelenting quest to find a cure for the terrible disease.But what does donning a pink T-shirt really do? Does it have some magical healing power that can miraculously cure someone with breast cancer? No, it’s just a color. So why does it seem to cover everything during the month of October?The whole concept of raising awareness for a disease by wearing a certain color seems bizarre. Unfortunately, being aware of a disease is not going to cure it; medical research is, and research takes money. Each year, thousands of potential medical research projects go unfunded.


 


According to a synthesis of published evidence by the U.S. National Library of Medicine, the average lifetime cost of treating breast cancer ranges from $20,000 to $100,000, and health insurance may not cover everything. Those without health insurance are pretty much guaranteed to be in debt for the rest of their lives in order to pay for treatment.People who really want to help in the fight against breast cancer often will buy products that donate a portion of the costs to cancer research. Why not take it a step further and just donate the money directly? Instead of paying a salon to dye part of your hair pink in an attempt to show support of breast cancer (like I almost did), donate the money you were planning to spend to a non-profit foundation that not only funds research, but also helps people who have been affected by breast cancer.As college students, we may not have the bank account to actually donate money to an organization, but there are other ways of donating to fight cancer. For example, donating your hair to Locks of Love or Pantene Beautiful Lengths is a great way to help those who have has lost their hair as a result of treatment. There are also several events such as Relay for Life that allow people to raise money through sponsorships.I commend those who want to support the fight against breast cancer, but ask yourself if what you are planning to do actually helps. If it doesn’t, find something else because cancer isn’t going to cure itself.— Sarah Lane is a junior from Rome majoring in communication studies","Sarah Lane

22-Oct-13,Georgia's offense came to a screeching halt after injuries,"At one point this season, the Georgia Bulldogs were touted as a team that could outscore any team it played.It was perceived that if Georgia was going to win games — accounting for its young, underperforming defense — the Bulldogs' offense, on the shoulders of redshirt senior quarterback Aaron Murray and the explosive weapons around him, must put significant numbers on the scoreboard to challenge other teams to record similarly outstanding statistics and scores. And, for the most part, through the daunting, early-season schedule, Georgia did just that.


 


""We had a very balanced offensive attack that could score whenever we needed to,"" offensive lineman Chris Burnette said. ""It’s a little tougher now, but at the same time, we can still put up points when we need to.""As the season progressed, however, injuries began to tally for the Bulldogs. It wasn't just any injuries, though. One by one, Murray's aforementioned weapons began dropping in doses — and in the strangest ways. First, it was wide receiver Malcolm Mitchell leaping to celebrate a teammate's touchdown against Clemson (ACL; out for the year). Then it was wide receiver Justin Scott-Wesley, untouched, covering a punt that was called for a fair catch (ACL; out for the year). Then it was wide receiver Michael Bennett, untouched, throwing a phantom block on a defender (meniscus; out multiple weeks).On Saturday against Vanderbilt, the Bulldogs added another ailed wide receiver to the list when Chris Conley leaped on Georgia's desperation Hail Mary, only to have his foot caught under a defender as the two fell to the ground. The previous injury list doesn't even mention standout sophomore running backs Todd Gurley and Keith Marshall who have also been absent from Georgia's back-to-back Southeastern Conference losses.""It’s been tough,"" Burnette said. ""Not necessarily on how it affects the team, but seeing guys who work so hard have freak injuries just take them out so quickly. It’s tough to see. You want guys to be able to play a game they really enjoy playing.""As the number of available bodies has diminished for the Bulldogs, so has the offensive production.Through the first four games of the season, and what was considered to be the meat of the Bulldogs' schedule, Georgia produced 554 yards per game — 209 per game on the ground and 345 per game through the air.Since, the Bulldogs have totaled under 400 yards per game (369.7, to be exact), and the numbers have noticeably gone down in the passing game. Murray, who was averaging just under 350 yards per game through the first four games, has averaged 200 yards per game in the last three, including a lowly 114 yards passing in Georgia's 31-27 loss to Vanderbilt.


 


It's no coincidence the plunge in offensive statistics came at the same time as the flood of offensive injuries.""It’s going to continue to take some time and we’re going to continue to work on it,"" quarterback Aaron Murray said. ""We worked a lot today with those young receivers, a lot of routes today, so that was good.""The loss against the Commodores marked a series of season lows to further indicate the struggle the Bulldogs have faced since the injuries started piling. For the first time in 2013, Georgia recorded less rushing yards than its opponent as the Bulldogs totaled 107 yards to the Commodores' 119. Murray's 28 pass attempts was his second-fewest of the season, behind only the South Carolina game when the quarterback's 23 passes came on 74 percent passing, so the lack of throws wasn't much of a concern.Perhaps most alarming was Georgia's inability to get first downs, moving the chains only 14 times on Saturday, five less than the previous season-low against Tennessee. One of the reasons the Bulldogs struggled to get first downs was the team's lack of willingness to attempt more medium and long-range routes.Aside from the team's hail mary to end the Vanderbilt contest, Murray only threw one pass over 20 yards downfield.""It all comes down to trusting our guys to go make plays down the field,"" Murray said. ""We just have to let it rip. As an offense, we have to be better with that. Once we do that, things will open up a little bit more for us.""Getting the passing game back on track will be key as quickly as possible with the team's next game coming against rival Florida whose secondary is labeled as one of the best in the nation.

""We just got to keep building the trust with them and myself because it’s going to be a tough game versus Florida,"" Murray said.While building that rapport with the younger receivers is still important, the Georgia offense would love to have one of its star receivers return for such a physical matchup, and according to one Bulldog, Bennett might be able to do just that.""Bennett said he'll be running full speed on Thursday,"" tight end Arthur Lynch said. ""He told me last week he's playing Florida, so I'm taking that to the bank.""",Benjamin Wolk,sports,https://www.redandblack.com/sports/georgia-s-offense-came-to-a-screeching-halt-after-injuries/article_f23c7a18-3b73-11e3-acc6-001a4bcf6878.html
22-Oct-13,She Blinded Me with Science: What’s celiac disease?,"Question: What’s the difference between celiac disease and gluten sensitivity?Answer: Science is still working on that one, actually, but both are caused by the body’s reaction to gluten, a protein found in wheat and other grains like rye and barley.Both disorders have identical symptoms. Patients most commonly complain of diarrhea and weight loss, but other signs of an adverse reaction to gluten include anemia, skin rashes, acid reflux and fatigue. Because of the similarity of the symptoms, doctors have to look to evidence produced by the patient’s body to make a diagnosis.


 


Gluten is naturally hard for the body to break down, said Michele Monteil, a professor of immunology at the Georgia Regents University / University of Georgia Medical Partnership. For some people, gluten gets into the intestinal wall, and the body reacts by creating an antibody that attacks an enzyme found naturally in the intestine to break down gluten.“What we actually have now is the development of an immune response which was started by the gluten but is now directed against the enzyme which is part of your body,” Monteil said. “So it becomes now an autoimmune reaction.”The immune system’s reaction causes the intestinal wall to become inflamed and damage the tiny hair-like villi that line the intestines and makes them unable to absorb nutrients, Monteil said.Doctors look for the antibodies that react to that enzyme, as a way to diagnose a patient with celiac disease.But what about gluten intolerance, then?“What began to happen is they began to realize some people did not have the evidence of these antibodies,” Monteil said. “So, they had the clinical presentation of celiac disease. They would seem to do better — sometimes they would put themselves on a gluten-free diet, but there was no evidence of these antibodies that we associate with celiac disease.”This is the group scientists consider to have non-celiac gluten sensitivity, she said. And researchers are still working to better define what intolerance is and who has it. There used to be a certain degree of controversy surrounding the idea of gluten intolerance, but Monteil said it is becoming more widely accepted.“What is suggested is anyone who has those symptoms that overlap with celiac disease or some people who have what is called irritable bowl syndrome — particularly those who present with more diarrheal irritable bowl syndrome — that they should see their doctor and that the doctor should really try to rule out or assess for celiac disease,” Monteil said.


 


She said the next step would be to document whether or not a gluten-free diet helps the patient. She did point out that many people who go on a gluten-free diet without consulting a doctor — unlike celiac patients or those who may have gluten intolerance — don’t hear about some of the possible consequence which, among other things, includes the exclusion of vitamins found in enriched wheat products like the B Vitamins.“A gluten-free diet may not be all that benign,” Monteil said. “In other words, there’s been some suggestions that it may be important for determining the kind of gut bacteria that you have and that removing gluten completely may remove some of the good bacterial guys and increase the likelihood of some of the bad bacterial guys.”The basic message is go see your doctor if you think you might have a gluten-related disorder or are thinking about making a big change to your diet like nixing all the gluten.“There’s a lot of interest in the consequences of gluten-free diet,” Monteil said. “And if you go on a gluten-free diet maybe you need to be educated about the other things that you have to do.”Editor's note: To submit a question to She Blinded Me with Science, send it to The Red & Black's science beat reporter, Jeanette Kazmierczak, @sciencekaz.Want more She Blinded Me with Science?

24-Oct-13,Motion filed to remove evidence from Emily Bowman hit-and-run case,"The lawyers defending the 22-year-old man who allegedly hit and injured Emily Bowman, 19, filed a motion Tuesday to suppress evidence they felt Athens-Clarke County police officers gathered illegally.The evidence in question includes items found in a search of William Wilson Heaton’s truck and an interview with his parents, according to documents obtained by The Red & Black.Heaton allegedly hit Bowman on Feb. 16 when his red Mazda pick-up truck swerved off the side of Oak Street and hit the former Kennesaw State University student from behind. He drove away from the crash and abandoned his truck at an apartment complex nearby on Appleby Drive, according to a previous Red & Black article.


 


When ACC police officers found Heaton’s truck, they allegedly conducted a “warrantless search,” collecting hair and swabbing for DNA. The officers also found a near-empty liquor bottle and beer cans in the truck, according to the Red & Black article.Then they took the truck as evidence without confirming that it was involved in the accident, according to the court documents.The defense argues all evidence from the Mazda should be disregarded.The prosecution said the officers “did not enter the truck at this time, but remained lawfully around the exterior of the truck,” according to the documents. But the defense argues this should not excuse the officer’s search and seizure of the truck without a warrant.Kevin Epps and Anthony Perrotta, attorneys for Heaton, also asserted that Athens-Clarke County police officers allegedly took a witnesses’ phone without a warrant because they “doubted” his account. In the motion, the defense requested all text messages, Facebook posts or “other statements retrieved from electronic devices” be discounted as well.The officers also allegedly “threatened to arrest [Heaton’s] parents,” an action which the defense argued “compelled” them to “give factual interviews to the State’s investigators,” according to the documents.Heaton’s attorneys requested all evidence regarding his general drinking habits, speculation about the crash, and his past criminal and medical history be dismissed from the case.They said in the motion this evidence is “irrelevant, speculative, constitutes hearsay,” and shows more prejudice to Heaton than factual accuracy.


 


The defense also wanted to exclude statements about Heaton’s blood alcohol content that night. Since the investigating officer could not give Heaton a blood or breathalyzer test immediately after the incident, he calculated the 22-year-old’s approximate BAC level by watching a video of him ordering drinks at a bar downtown the night he allegedly hit Bowman.The defense saw this as “speculation,” according to the documents.Epps and Perrota asked any statement suggesting Heaton is guilty because he allegedly left the scene be dropped as well. They wrote he was exercising his Fourth Amendment right to not talk to police the morning after the accident, and that saying he “was ‘fleeing’ or ‘evading’ is irrelevant to the charges.”An arrest warrant was obtained against Heaton on March 6 and he was charged on 13 counts, including “serious injury by vehicle,” reckless driving,” and “leaving the scene of an accident involving serious injury.”Heaton pleaded not guilty to these charges on July 16. The case is ongoing.","Jana French

24-Oct-13,Homegrown Gym Dog establishes herself with work ethic,"Athens-native Morgan Reynolds dreamed of being a Gym Dog since before she can remember.“Growing up I would come to Gym Dog meets,” Reynolds said. ""There’s nothing like a Gym Dog meet — everybody’s going crazy and there’s so many fans. I just fell in love with it. There was never really a question of where I wanted to go. I’ve always wanted to come here.”Making the decision even easier was the fact that senior Lindsey Cheek is not only from Athens as well but went to the same club gym as Reynolds growing up.


 


“She’s always been like an older sister to me,” Reynolds said. “Even since I’ve been here, she’s helped me out a lot. Seeing that she came here and has done so well and how much she loved it made the decision that much easier.”Being back on the same team as her has been a blessing for both Reynolds and Cheek.However, even though the desire to go to Georgia was in full force, Reynolds admitted she wanted a scholarship more. So had Georgia not offered her the big prize, Reynolds might have found herself somewhere else, such as Alabama, Washington or Nebraska.“I wanted to come here, but I also wanted to get a scholarship somewhere,” Reynolds said. “I was only going to come here if I did get a scholarship, and if not, I was going to look at other schools. So I did look at other schools, but when Georgia offered it, I accepted.”The possibility of earning a scholarship became more real when Cheek became the first gymnast from Georgia to receive a scholarship from the University in quite a while.“Seeing how she was the first one made me think maybe I could do it too,” Reynolds said. “It was always in my mind, but it just made it more real.”Reynolds' homegrown experience differs from most freshmen on the team.“My junior and senior year we [performed] before the Gym Dog meets, and it was cool because I knew that I was actually going to be there,” Reynolds said. “I guess it is kind of an advantage. I was telling Kiera [Brown] and Ashlyn [Broussard] about it because they’ve never been to a Gym Dog meet and didn’t know what it was like. I was like, ‘Oh my gosh. It is so crazy. You’re going to love it.’”


 


To ensure that she got the chance to get back out on that stage again, Reynolds continued to work her butt off in the gym.“Growing up, Morgan was always the hardest worker in the gym. Always,” Cheek said. “Morgan is always taking the most turns out of anybody and since she’s gotten to college, it’s more about limiting those numbers because you do have to last longer because you have a longer season than you ever did in club. The mental aspect of cutting down your numbers is not easy for people, but she’s definitely handled that very well as a freshman.”At first it may have been a tough transition, but when times are tough, Reynolds is able to seek advice from Cheek because of their familiar paths.“It’s great to be that older girl in club watching down on her and then being a senior in college and watching her grow as a freshman in college,” Cheek said. “We always goofed off all the time in club and even now it’s nice to be able to have her back and be doing the same stuff again.""When she’s not “working her tail off” in the gym, Reynolds is by far the class clown of the group.“She is unexpected,"" Georgia head coach Danna Durante said. ""You see this quiet kid, but really she’s a great big goofball. Don’t let her fool you. And that has just added so much personality to this team.”All-in-all, the love and pride for the University and the Gym Dogs will help get Reynolds far as a member of the team.“To be able to step out and be in front of the home crowd, it’ll be very exciting for her,” Durante said. “It’s a dream come true for her, and I’m excited for her to experience that. I’m getting chills just thinking about it. I’m ready for January.”

26-Oct-13,'Old-fashioned embarrassment' teaches lesson about attendance,"My heart sinks. I can feel the blood rushing throughout my body as my temperature seems to rise exponentially. The most intimidating silence has fallen upon the entire classroom which now has all eyes on me. I’ve been called on in class.It doesn’t happen as often as it did in grade school, but on rare and nightmare-worthy occasions, it can still happen in college. It happened to me, and it can happen to you. Whether for having your cell phone out, leaving class too early or in my case, simply being an idiot, don’t underestimate your professor’s potential to single you out and give you an old fashioned taste of embarrassment.I’ll be honest though, I had it coming. Having primarily large lecture hall classes for my underclassman years, I had gotten a little too comfortable in my classes. I had come to think how improbable it would be for a professor to individually call on me for anything in a class with so many students on the roster. This, however, was a naïve thought.


 


About five minutes after taking my seat in the back row, where all the rare-comers and hungover students nestle in, the professor prepared to start class. As I got out my notebook and prepared to doodle the class time away, the professor dropped the bomb that rattles my soul to its core — “Who is Sam Smith?”I frantically tried to scan my brain for any scenario that might offer me a loophole out of having to come forward as the holder of that name, only to draw a blank. I prepared to meet my fate, taking a moment to try to maintain my composure and flush out the beet red color that had infiltrated my face. I shakily claimed my identity as the whole class turned to behold my shame.I knew what it was about too, I had stupidly written an entire paper for one of the professor’s other classes because I hadn’t gone to class the previous week. I assumed I had just missed the announcement of the assignment, and frantically hashed out a few pages worth of half-hearted analysis the night before.After a stressful scolding from the professor and a somewhat sardonic remark from the TA about showing up to class more often, I learned my lesson. Show up to class, so you know what’s going on, so you don’t spend a whole afternoon writing a paper you don’t have to and so you don’t have to walk in and out of class with your tail between your legs because you’re that idiot who got called out.— Sam Smith is a junior from Marietta majoring in mass media arts",Sam Smith,views,https://www.redandblack.com/views/old-fashioned-embarrassment-teaches-lesson-about-attendance/article_807f4f32-3e83-11e3-b4bb-001a4bcf6878.html
29-Oct-13,Football notebook: Gurley on track for Florida return,"With its second bye week in the rear-view mirror, Georgia keeps getting good news on the injury front.Todd Gurley, considered the best running back in the nation by many, practiced in full on Monday afternoon for the first time since hurting his ankle against LSU over a month ago. His teammates say he looks better than ever.“Todd’s looking good out there. He looks pretty good. About 100 percent, for sure,"" tailback Brendan Douglas said. “He looks like his old self.”


 


With a critical game against the rival Florida Gators set for Saturday, Georgia (4-3, 3-2 SEC) hopes the old Gurley — the one that rushed 450 yards and four touchdowns in just four games — can make his presence known on the field sooner rather than later.“He looks pretty good,"" freshman tailback J.J. Green said. ""I hope he can do it in a game, be ready and we can just carry this load, because he’s back. Everybody’s scared to tackle him.”It remains to be seen just how many carries Gurley can log in the game considering he has not played since Sept. 28. But teammates have seen his second gear firsthand and they are not even concerned about his stamina.“He don’t ever get tired,"" Green said. “Even at the beginning of the season, this cat never gets tired. He always going.”But Gurley's production is just one aspect of what the Bulldogs have missed for the past month. His presence on the field, fullback Quayvon Hicks says, helps the entire offense from a mental perspective — a well-timed positive boost for a team coming off two straight conference losses.“It feels great to see him out there. Not only that impact player, but he’s the spark of our offense. He’s the motivation to keep us working, and he’s that clown that's going to put a smile on your face after you mess up,"" Hicks said. “Not only having him out there as a running back, but as a leader.”For Green and Douglas, their roles as UGA's primary rushing options may begin to wind down. But both should still receive carries and could break a few big ones with teams so focused on stopping Gurley.“I don’t think I ever had a job. I was just filling in for him,"" Green said of starting. ""That’s how I feel. I’m glad Todd is back. They’re going to be keying in for him, maybe get some bigger runs from me.”


 


Florida offense strugglingThe Gators (4-3, 3-2 SEC) come into this week with an offense that averages 21.1 points per game, third-worst in the Southeastern Conference. Its passing game has especially struggled since a broken leg ended quarterback Jeff Driskel's season.Starting quarterback Tyler Murphy has gone 30-for-56 as a passer in his past two games, throwing no touchdowns and one interception against LSU and Missouri. Murphy has been skittish in the pocket in both of those losses, making this game an important one for Jordan Jenkins and Leonard Floyd, Georgia's two edge rushers.“We need them two big this game to set the edge in the run defense and apply pressure,"" linebacker Ramik Wilson said. “It’s a good game if them two have a big game.”With an inability to throw with much consistency, Florida has relied on its running game for much of the season. The Bulldogs rank fourth in the SEC in rushing defense, allowing just over 136 yards per game on the ground, potentially making this contest a good matchup for the defense.“I think we match up well,"" Wilson said. ""They’re kind of like LSU; they want to run the ball. Pro-style. That’s what we like, and we know what they’re going to do. We just got to go out there, play hard and physical.”",Alec Shirkey,sports,https://www.redandblack.com/sports/football-notebook-gurley-on-track-for-florida-return/article_95f21870-40ba-11e3-9d06-0019bb30f31a.html
31-Oct-13,Dogs off the Leash: Matt Stafford's fake spike seals Detroit victory,"Down 30-24 to the Dallas Cowboys with 1:02 left on the clock, the Detroit Lions turned to quarterback and former Georgia Bulldog Matthew Stafford.Stafford would need just 50 seconds to drive 80 yards down the field for the game-tying touchdown followed by the David Akers extra point to give the Lions the one-point lead and victory.On that final drive, the biggest play was a deep pass down the sideline to Kris Durham, a connection seen often when the two played together at Georgia.


 


Although Stafford had 488 yards and a touchdown, his biggest play came courtesy of his feet when he ran a fake spike in for the final yard to cap off his game-winning drive.The Lions are now 5-3 while Stafford is on pace to throw for a career high 5,234 yards, which would rank third all time. Durham is on pace for 50 catches and 620 yards, both career highs.Other Bulldogs in the NFLSix former Bulldogs enjoyed a routing of the New York Jets as the Cincinnati Bengals strolled to a 49-9 victory.Wide receiver A.J. Green made the most of his three receptions, earning 115 yards while offensive guard Clint Boling helped his unit limit the NFL’s fifth-best pass rush to just one sack for two yards.On defense, safety Shawn Williams saw action for just the second time this season and recorded four tackles and defensive tackle Geno Atkins recorded a sack.Even tight-end-turned-fullback Orson Charles recorded two special teams tackles.In Denver, a matchup between a safety and a running back showcased two former Bulldogs who had solid performances.


 


Washington Redskins’ rookie safety Bacarri Rambo had eight solo tackles and nine total, including a tackle for loss.On the other side of the ball, Broncos’ running back Knowshon Moreno carried the ball for 44 yards and caught six passed for a team high 89 yards and a touchdown. Moreno and the Broncos came out on top 45-21 despite the early surge from the Redskins.Several other Bulldogs stood out during the NFL’s eighth week:
Two former Georgia defensive players helped the Carolina Panthers beat the winless Tampa Bay Buccaneers 31-13. Linebacker Thomas Davis had seven solo tackles, including two tackles for loss, and three pass deflections. Although teammate Charles Johnson had just two tackles, both were sacks.
Philadelphia Eagles cornerback Brandon Boykin recorded two tackles, a pass deflection and a quarterback hit in a 15-7 loss to the Giants.
In the Cowboys’ loss, defensive end Jarius Wynn had two tackles for loss.
Kansas City Chiefs linebacker Justin Houston had a sack and a second hit on the quarterback in a 23-17 win over the Cleveland Browns.
Miami Dolphins linebacker Dannell Ellerbe and safety Reshad Jones combined for 18 tackles, 11 of which belonged to Ellerbe, in the Dolphins’ loss to the New England Patriots 27-17.
In relief of the injured Jimmy Graham, New Orleans Saints tight end Benjamin Watson had three catches for 45 yards in a 35-17 victory over the Buffalo Bills.

2-Nov-13,Game rewind: Georgia beats Gators in another nail-biter,"JACKSONVILLE, Fla. – As has been the case all season, Georgia (5-3, 4-2 SEC) found itself part of a game that came down to the fourth quarter. This time, however, fortune favored the Bulldogs, who edged out Florida (4-4, 3-3 SEC) by a final score of 23-20. In doing so, UGA notches its third straight victory over the Gators for the first time since the days of Buck Belue and remains a dark-horse candidate in the ever-evolving race for the Southeastern Conference’s Eastern Division.PLAY OF THE GAME: Corey Moore sacks Tyler MurphyBarley holding onto a 3-point lead with just over 8:30 left in the game, the Bulldogs defense was faced with 3rd-and-12 at its own 43 yard-line. UGA had just allowed the Gators to convert on 4th down because of an illegal substitution penalty and generally looked flimsy after giving up 17 unanswered points in the second half. Enter a perfectly-timed sellout blitz, during which Moore was able to rush through the A-gap and take down Florida's quarterback for a loss of 14 yards. The play was crucial in preventing a complete Georgia collapse.


 


KEY DRIVE: The final possessionThis surely seems obvious, but it cannot be understated how important Georgia’s 15-play, 67-yard drive turned out to be. Burning 8:17 off the clock is no easy task, but the Bulldogs made it happen – mostly with their running game – while racking up three 3rd-down conversions and managed to escape Jacksonville with a pivotal SEC East victory.PLAYER OF THE GAME: Todd GurleyCould it be anyone else? In his first game played since suffering an ankle injury against LSU, Georgia’s sophomore tailback carried the ball 17 times for 100 yards rushing and caught three passes for 87 yards receiving, including a 73-yard receiving touchdown and a 5-yard rushing TD. He also logged a whopping eight carries (19 yards) on the aforementioned final drive. In all, Gurley accounted for 187 of UGA’s 414 yards of total offense. No other player came even close to that type of production for the Bulldogs.UNDERRATED PLAYER OF THE GAME: Garrison SmithSmith came into the game with 1.5 sacks on the season, but he left with 2.5 more. He also recorded 9 tackles (two for loss), one QB hurry and played an important role in limiting Florida to a 3.5 yard-per-carry rushing average.INTERESTING STAT: Safety sightingWith just over one minute left in the third quarter, Florida cornerback Loucheiz Purifoy came unblocked on a blitz and sacked Aaron Murray in the end zone for a safety. It was the first time the Gators had recorded a safety since 2011, when the UAB Blazers snapped a punt out of their own end zone.

3-Nov-13,"Football notebook: Bennett returns, Bulldogs make it three straight over Gators","JACKSONVILLE, Fla. – Sophomore running back Todd Gurley wasn’t the only Georgia key offensive player to return from injury against Florida.Junior wide receiver Michael Bennett was back in action against the Gators (4-4, 3-3 SEC) on Saturday for the first time since tearing his meniscus five weeks ago against Tennessee.“I was healthy. Didn’t even think about my knee. It was great,” Bennett said.


 


With junior wideout Chris Conley out on Saturday due a leg injury, Bennett was the Bulldogs’ No. 1 receiver and Georgia quarterback Aaron Murray looked his way a good bit early.“Early in the first half we thought we were going to put Bennett in the slot and work him in the slot and make several nice plays, big chunks of yardage and he ain’t the fastest, but that’s one tough football player that fights,” Georgia offensive coordinator Mike Bobo said. “If you put it near him he usually catches the ball.”Bennett had five catches for 59 yards in the first half, and that would be his total for the game as the Bulldogs switched to a more run-heavy offense in the second half.Georgia head coach Mark Richt had nothing but high praise for his junior wideout.“I thought Michael played well. I thought he made some really tough catches in tight coverage, which is what he does, which is what you have to do against this Florida defense because they do cover you so tight,” he said. “I think they’re the best cover corners in the league and maybe the country, but when they lock up on you it’s hard to get separation. If you use body position and reach out and snag the ball, no matter how tight the coverage, if the ball is put in the right spot you can make the play, and that’s what Michael has been able to do against Florida the past couple years.”Ga-Fla history madeThe Bulldogs did more than keep themselves alive in the SEC East with their win over Florida. In doing so, it marked the first time Georgia has notched three consecutive victories over the Gators since 1989 – 24 years ago.The Georgia-Florida rivalry always means a lot to the players involved, and especially the seniors. This year's group in particular has seen its share of misfortune with the unprecedented string of injuries and falling short of the the team's national title hopes.


 


“This game means a lot to me. I just wanted to give it my all. Played as hard as I could,"" said an emotional Garrison Smith. ""That’s why I’m in tears right now, because I just wanted to win. I ain’t cried in a long time, but these are tears of passion for this game. It means so much to me.”Smith, a senior defensive end, finished the day with a career-high 2.5 sacks and nine tackles (2.5 for loss).Fellow senior Rhett McGowan, a former walk-on wide receiver pressed into service by the wide array of injury on offense, caught caught three passes for 43 yards receiving against the Gators and made his share of important plays. Chief among those was a 7-yard reception on the game's final drive that helped put the game away for Georgia.“It’s exciting to go out on top,"" McGowan said. ""This is the most fun game of the year, and for us to win this year, the last time I’ll ever be here, playing for Georgia, this is huge. I’m so happy right now.”And of course there's senior quarterback Aaron Murray, who will finish his career with a 3-1 record against Florida. ""It's awesome. You always say 'Every game is the same. Every game is the same.' But this one is different. There's a different feel to it. The atmosphere is different,"" Murray said. ""To go out and beat these guys three years in a row, which hasn't happened in 24 years, is just an awesome feeling.""Deep-rooted hatredIt wouldn’t be a Georgia vs. Florida matchup without a little heated confrontation.

The game was tamed throughout the first half as the Bulldogs went into halftime with a 23-3 lead, but as the Gators pulled their deficit closer, things began to get chippy.There were 11 unsportsmanlike conduct penalties called in the second half, most of which were off setting, but that’s still an absurd number of penalty flags to be thrown.“Guys were just talking trash, Florida guys were talking trash, late hits and after they romped Todd and other stuff we were pretty mad about that,” sophomore linebacker Jordan Jenkins said.“These guys are competitors. It’s a bitter rivalry,” Richt said. “We were getting our guys revved up and I guarantee they were getting their guys revved up before the game. We wanted their blood pumping and we wanted them to be able to compete fiercely without any flags, but it got a little carried away.”Even Murray got into the mix when he was flagged for an unsportsmanlike conduct penalty following a scuffle broke out after he kneeled the ball towards the end of the game.Richt found himself trying to keep track of the penalties so his players weren’t affected by the new NCAA rule change.“With the new rule, we really had to keep track of who has the fouls because if you get two unsportsmanlike conducts, you’re kicked out of the game so we really had to do a good job,” he said. “Even when Murray got one I’m thinking about taking him out of the game because if he got another one, he’s out the next game. Put a new quarterback in, fumble the snap, I mean I have all the faith in Hutson Mason, but if something weird happened then you’re an idiot. It’s just a highly competitive game and you hope you can keep but have those flags, but it didn’t shock me.”",Connor Smolensky & Alec Shirkey,sports,https://www.redandblack.com/sports/football-notebook-bennett-returns-bulldogs-make-it-three-straight-over/article_cc8194e2-443e-11e3-b684-001a4bcf6878.html

7-Nov-13,No. 1 UGA equestrian hosts No. 9 Texas A&M; on Friday,"No. 1 Georgia equestrian faces No. 9 Texas A&M on Friday, but despite beating the Aggies in three decisive victories last season, the squad still respects each meet against its opponents and does not rely on past matchups or head-to-head wins.“I think it’s something that is always in the back of the mind that you’re always fighting. The thing about working to compete against yourself instead of the opponent is that you are always working hard to better your scores and better your opportunities no matter who the opponent is,” head coach Meghan Boenig said. “A&M just beat, recently, USC and they are a good competitor so we have to always have respect for these competitors and not look at history and slow down. The last thing we need is to take our foot off the pedal.”The team has been working to prepare for Texas A&M during its four-week hiatus and knows its opponents strengths.


 


“They are very well coached and always prepared. I think that they are always very spirited,” Boenig said. “I look for them to put up a good competition.”Senior Louise Ashley believes the Bulldogs will come out on top again against the newly minted Southeastern Conference foe.“A&M is growing and they did just South Carolina last weekend, so they are pretty consistent,” Ashley said. “But I think that we are feeling really confident because we also just beat South Carolina and I think our home advantage will be huge. Last year we were really pumped when they came here and I think the same environment is going on now. We are pumped and ready to beat them again.”The team’s home field advantage could play a huge role in the meet, but it can also be a hindrance.“Home competition is always an advantage. You have a sense of familiarity, you know the horses, you know the hands, and you have set routine that it established at home,” Boenig said. “However, I think for those exact same reasons because when you expect things, sometimes, that can get you into trouble. We really want the riders to focus on what they are feeling and riding in the moment. That is something that is always a challenge at home.”Western rider Charley Thiel believes that the team’s key to winning is to stay focused and stay positive.“We need to prepare just like we prepare for any meet regardless of rankings or anything recently that has happened with a team and work our hardest,” Thiel said. “I also think that keeping a positive attitude and mentality about that whole situation. Anytime we go into a meet, we always have a good attitude but we need to make sure we keep our heads focused and think about our main goal.”There are freshman who will be competing against Texas A&M for the first time Friday, but aren’t deterred by A&M’s success against USC. Thiel is one of them.


 


“I’m hoping to perform my best. I have goals that I have set for myself and goals for this weekend,” Thiel said. “I specific goals and I’m determined to reach those goals so I can contribute to the team.”Thiel has had help from her teammates and coaches, who have shared tips and given her advice for the meet.“The advice for the freshman is the same as the rest of the team. We need to stay the course. The month of November it’s every single weekend for us,” Boenig said. “October was the last of the breathers for us and we were able to do a lot of preparation for this particular meet. We worked on a lot of fundamentals that will, hopefully, carry for the rest of the season and the rest of this month.”Thiel’s teammates gave her some valuable pointers as well.“The other girls have told me to never let the fear of a team who has good competition worry me,” Thiel said. “They also told me to just go out there and ride my best and to have confidence.”Confidence is what the team thrives on.“Our girls are just great and consistent,” Ashley said. “We are really strong and have positions where we are just better against A&M.”The meet is set to at 2 p.m. in Bishop, Ga.

7-Nov-13,Students to decide whether to spend more green to help UGA go green,"In addition to electing their chosen candidate for homecoming king and homecoming queen, University of Georgia students will decide this week on an issue with a more lasting effect than an annual title.Voting ends Friday at noon on whether to increase the green fee from $3 to $4The $1 hike would finance projects to make UGA more sustainable and energy-efficient, said Tyler Faby, Chair of the Go Green Alliance, in a presentation to the Student Government Association earlier this month.


 


The Office of Sustainability, which oversees green fee funds, will spend 55 percent of its budget on administrative costs like staff salaries this year, according to the office’s projected fiscal year 2013 budget. The office dedicates 27 percent of the budget to sustainability initiatives and pilot programs, like the tricolor recycling bins in the Miller Learning Center and the solar panels that gleam from the top of the Jackson Street Building.Faby, a junior from Milton majoring in finance, said the decision to carve office salaries out of the student-funded green fee, rather than the UGA staff payroll, is “unorthodox.” The effective green fee is $1.29 after discounting what students pay for administrative costs, he said.“People will come up to us and say, ‘you guys got sort of gypped with that pothole,’” Faby said with a chuckle. “But don’t blame me. I wasn’t here when they originally passed it in 2010.”Students created the Go Green Alliance in 2009 for a class project, but soon formed a consolidated movement with other campus sustainability organizations. In a strong showing of student support, the green fee referendum received more than 4,000 votes in 2010, Faby said.The Student Government Association persuaded the University Union Homecoming committee to include the proposal for a green fee increase on the ballot. The SGA Senate approved a resolution to pair the ballot initiative with homecoming voting in a 47-6 vote on Oct. 15.While championing a vote, SGA has played this issue close to the vest.“SGA as an organization is maintaining a neutral stance on the issue (neither in favor nor against the $1 increase),” SGA Executive Secretary Jim Thompson wrote in a weekly email to members of SGA. “But, you are more than welcome to promote your own individual views on the issue.”The SGA Senate will take a vote on the merits of the fee increase on Nov. 19, should the initiative see robust support from student body this week, said Greyson Clark, Director of the Policy Board and a senior international affairs, French and history major from Douglasville.


 


Should the Senate approve it, the fee would still require a formal stamp of approval of a mandatory fee advisory committee on Nov. 22. At least 50 percent of the seats on the committee would belong to students, per the Georgia Board of Regents policy manual. SGA would appoint the student delegates, according to the manual.Of the nine fees students dole out every fall and spring semester, the green fee is the least expensive. The second most affordable fee is the recreation fee at $15. At $3, the green fee represents 0.2 percent of total per-semester fee expenses and is $447 less expensive than the special institutional fee.Faby said that University Architects for Facility Planning account for environmental sustainability in their designs, but the dollars for those costly, energy-efficient upgrades peter out in the five to 10 years of construction and annual budget balancing.“It has come to the attention of the Environmental Affairs Committee of the Student Government Association that most major sustainability projects pertaining to energy production and efficiency are stopped at the upper tier of administrative financial offices,” reads Faby’s written proposal for an increase.In 2010, UGA committed to decreasing campus energy use by 25 percent.“We have about 11 percent to go on that, to meet that goal,” Faby said.Since the University classifies green fee funding as discretionary, the office has the authority to direct any increased funding from a higher green fee to their own salaries or other expenses that are not on-campus sustainability projects, Faby said. But Faby said he is “confident” the additional funds will finance tangible initiatives.“While we’re not requesting an increase, we’re happy to support a student initiative to increase campus sustainability,” said Office of Sustainability Director Kevin Kirsche said. ""It was students, after all, who drove the campaign three years ago to institute a green fee, Kirsche said.

“We think with more funds we can do more work,” Kirsche said. “We want to ensure the money is used in a way that reflects students’ values and interests.”","Emily Kopp

7-Nov-13,Gym Dogs recuperated and ready to go after five-day break,"After training almost non-stop since August, the Georgia gymnastics team finally got an extended break this past weekend.“Mentally and physically we were just drained,” senior Kaylan Earls said. “Your body needs a little break. Five days may seem like a lot, but if you’re training and doing some cardio then it’s really good to get that break and then come back on Monday and have a lot more energy than you did the week before.”It’s important to take a breather now since it will be one of the last times before late April that there will be another opportunity to relax.


 


“Once we get closer to the meet season, there’s no break,” Earls said. “You’re full speed. If we’re able to get that in earlier, it’s good because our bodies are going non-stop and pounding like no other.”The break was not only a chance to get away from the gym for a few days but to get away from the demands of class as well.“Gymnastics is mentally tough and with school also it just adds to it more,” freshman Ashlyn Broussard said. “You have to find a balance between the two and get stressed out easily. The breaks help so you can calm down and recuperate.”Georgia head coach Danna Durante said that it’s also nice to have something to work toward so that it doesn’t feel like “there’s never a relief in sight.”“We talk a lot about having a picture in your mind of what your calendar looks like, so that you have something to work toward,” Durante said. “It’s much easier when you know you’ve got a break coming up to push hard until that point.”As for how the Gym Dogs chose to spend their time off, the activities varied from athlete to athlete.“A couple of them went home like Brittany Rogers went all the way back to Vancouver — that’s a long trip, but it was just what she needed,” Durante said. “Some of them stayed here, but that was OK just to not have their schedule booked up morning to night.”Now that they’re back on campus, training has picked back up once again. But coming back from almost a week off was difficult for some of the younger Gym Dogs.


 


“Monday was interesting,” Durante said. “Some of the younger ones had not taken five days off and come back and hit the ground running before. We can’t just come back and start with real easy sets and dance through. But once they knew what they needed to do, they did better.”Full-set verification is in two-weeks so it was time to get serious this week.“Usually we have a hard week and focus more on gymnastics more than conditioning and then move into a medium week and then a little bit easier week,” Earls said. “This week has been a harder week. We have more numbers in the gym.”Although the team is looking better at this point in the fall than last year, there is still room for improvement.“We’re trying to be more efficient and try more routines and get all of the little details fixed,” Broussard said. “We’re really ready. I feel like we’re really prepared. There’s still a couple months left, but we’re in a really good spot so far.”The gymnastics and skills are there, but it’s the confidence and competition mentality that is still lacking.“We have a lot of work to do competitively to get them consistent and comfortable when we do an intrasquad or show as a team,” Durante said. “We have some work to do there. We definitely have some work to do so that they can show their best gymnastics when the pressure is on. More pressure opportunities, more competition opportunities, more teamwork will help with that.”",Elizabeth Grimsley,sports,https://www.redandblack.com/sports/gym-dogs-recuperated-and-ready-to-go-after-five-day/article_06daef7c-47f9-11e3-b794-0019bb30f31a.html
8-Nov-13,"The false notion of ""free"" health care","On the front page of the New York Times on Monday, Nov. 4, an article bore the title “Millions Eligible for Free Policies Under Care Act.” As the title would suggest, the article goes on to explain that millions of Americans qualify to have “the entire monthly cost of some health care plans” offered under Obamacare covered by the federal government, the “bulk of these plans [being] so-called bronze policies.”Temporarily set aside the fact that the government should not be in the business of providing health care in any fashion (whether Obamacare, Medicare, Medicaid or any other program), and instead pause to consider the use of the word “free” in reference to these plans.Perhaps in the entire history of the United States, never has another word been thrown around so liberally and with such flagrant disregard for the facts of reality than the word “free” with respect to government programs.


 


Reflect for a brief moment on the nature of the medical industry, and this becomes abundantly clear.There are doctors, nurses and other medical professionals and staff who devote their time, skills and efforts to their profession and who must be compensated for their labor.Ambulances cost money to operate, and drivers and paramedics must be paid.Any pharmaceuticals, medical equipment and hospital space being used for treatment must be paid for to reward the pharmacists, technicians and staff who manage those things through their productive abilities. This is to say nothing of the researchers who spent years developing the drugs and technology we employ, and who must also be given their hard-earned income.Then in what sense are these plans free? The medical industry does not work for free, and it would not even were it wholly nationalized (to preempt proponents of such an atrocity). The individuals covered under these plans will still accrue medical costs, and those costs have to be paid.Naturally, that is not a consideration the so-called “humanitarians” peddling these policies concern themselves with. Of course, we are well aware of the government’s source of revenue, as are the egalitarian nihilists too calloused to care that they are robbing people of their hard-earned incomes through vampiric tax policies to pay the expenses of others to whom they have no connection, relationship or duty.Every penny used to pay for these “free” policies must first be produced and earned by someone else, who is then compelled under force of law to sacrifice that income on behalf of someone who has not earned it. It is saying, in essence, “Someone else is more entitled to your own income than you are, by the simple fact that they ‘need’ it.”To be clear, I do not begrudge those who accept such subsidies while offered — provided that the same individuals only accept them as a gift, not a right.


 


In a capitalist health care system — and we were still far from capitalist health care prior to Obamacare — individuals would be responsible for their own health care, whether through purchasing insurance or creating a savings account from which they can draw in case of medical need. The cost of insurance plans would be dependent on the individual’s relative medical risk — a practice that has been stunted through Obamacare provisions relating to preexisting conditions, sex-specific treatments and age. If an individual falls short in covering his medical expenses, he may ask for the charitable assistance of others, but he cannot demand it.In any case, the notion of anything provided by the government being “free” is an evasion of Clintonian proportions. These programs are not free. They are paid for by the American taxpayer — by the individual who produces, earns and deserves his income in full.—Brian Underwood is a senior from Evans majoring in history and political science","Brian Underwood

11-Nov-13,In defense of journalism,"Journalism has come a long way through the years. Publick Occurances, America’s first newspaper, was published in 1690, with mass production beginning in 1769 after the advent of the printing press. As technology improved, news began to travel faster, and it hasn’t slowed down yet. But somewhere along the way, pop culture invaded the news. Programs such as “The Colbert Report” satirized the news to increase its entertainment value — creating a dependence on the laughter of a studio audience. But the plethora of comic televised and online “news” sources aside, there is one culprit that rises above them all. It is a monster known for lengthy lists, images that could come from a stock folder and pages upon pages about Ryan Gosling. This monster can be found on almost any Facebook newsfeed, usually prefaced by a sentiment along the lines of “Haha #4 and 16 are totally us!”


 


The monster is BuzzFeed.And this is my final plea to BuzzFeed: please — for the love of God — just stop. Stop with the “71 Reasons We Need to Save Corgis from Extinction.” Stop with the “15 Weird Events Where People Throw Things” (never once is a baseball game mentioned). Stop with any current event “explained by Mean Girls” and stop with the animated GIFs.While contributors may be highly capable human beings with resumes that would put even Gay Talese to shame, the content produced for BuzzFeed is nothing short of lazy. If you can’t (or simply won’t) describe the government shutdown using anything but quotes from “Ferris Bueller’s Day Off,” “Arrested Development” or “Breaking Bad,” then you’re not qualified to comment on the subject.But BuzzFeed’s large audience is the root of the problem. Contributors continue to produce such poor excuses for online content because readers continue to read it. In fact, they don’t just read it — they browse from one meaningless article to the next for hours on end, keeping page views high and shares on social media abounding. The laziness of a “BuzzFeed generation” is really to blame.The popularity of the site is alarming, to say the least. Sure, it’s relatable — every resurfaced photo of Britney Spears from 2001 takes me back to a childhood of Kool-Aid Bursts and crimped hair —but aren’t there more pressing subjects to browse online?But for the sake of making my point clear to even the laziest of readers, I will concede to these brutish tactics, just this once.In the (somewhat bastardized) words of Ms. Norbury from “Mean Girls”: journalism has been personally victimized by BuzzFeed.—Laura Thompson is the views editor for The Red & Black

13-Nov-13,In defense of BuzzFeed,"In a recent Red & Black column, Laura Thompson, the opinions editor, accused BuzzFeed of ruining journalism.BuzzFeed is not ruining journalism.While I’ll be the first to make sarcastic comments about BuzzFeed and its readership, I still can’t fault them for the decline in journalism.


 


Keep in mind that the media group is profiting about $60 million a year due to the ridiculous amount of website traffic and native advertising.With the financial problems that all of journalism is experiencing across the map, I think Thompson's plea to BuzzFeed shouldn’t be “please stop” — it should be “show us how to do it.” Honestly, what they’re doing isn’t even a new concept. Sure, there’s a certain lack of serious subject matter, but at least they’re attempting to spread some general knowledge about current events.And have you ever tried searching the web for the perfect meme to describe a sentence? It’s not as easy as it looks. What they’re doing is innovative, not “lazy.”Believe it or not, there is plenty of evidence to suggest that the use of comedy and humor actually increases your amount of working memory and IQ.There’s an art to creating something that will grab your attention and then teach you something while you’re engaged. This is something that even reputable news organizations having been trying to do long before “The Colbert Report” and “The Daily Show” arrived on the scene.Last year, a survey published by Fairleigh Dickinson University showed that people who watched just “The Daily Show” for their news were more well equipped to answer questions about national and international current events. Even more so than CNN or Fox News.I wouldn’t be surprised to see BuzzFeed creep up on that list sooner or later.


 


I think the popularity of BuzzFeed isn’t “alarming,” but rather, it’s intriguing. And we as journalists should try and figure out how we might implement their success factor without degrading quality or integrity.For example, the video made by the Center for Investigative Reporting that used the famous Zero Wing “All your base are belong to us” as a delivery tool to shine a light on how much marijuana has been seized at the U.S.-Mexico border over the years.Or the “NSA Mad Libs” news app done by Mother Jones that allows you to choose-your-own (redacted) Mad Libs.It’s all about engaging your reader, getting them to remember and, most importantly, getting them to return. And to be honest, while I find the overall serious content to be lacking, they do publish long-form new stories and features, some from great Atlanta journalists that I personally know. There’s a reason why most journalism is presented at a low-reading level: it’s to appeal to the lowest common denominator. That’s not a bad thing — just a fact of life. We’re trying to inform the public about facts that are important and relevant to them. What’s the harm in adding a little entertainment value if the truth isn’t distorted? Or having something flashy to get their attention, but also producing quality work as well?I’m really tired of journalists, both novice and seasoned veterans, trying to scapegoat something — whether it’s a recent reporter ne’er-do-well, a major (or minor) mistake by a media company, or new forms of media — as the reason why journalism is on the decline.—David Schick is a senior from Conyers majoring in journalism

14-Nov-13,Gym Dogs prepare for first full intrasquad of the fall,"Friday marks the first full intrasquad the Georgia gymnastics has this preseason.“We’ve had a couple of these testing points along the way with each of them getting a little bit more difficult,” junior Chelsea Davis said. “But this will be the first full intrasquad that we all do. It’ll be the first chance that we get to see everyone doing the full stuff.”In order to come away feeling accomplished from the test, sophomore Mary Beth Box said the team is looking to minimize small errors that can be costly during competition.


 


“We’re looking to see where exactly we are,” Box said. “Pretty much everybody will have what we need to have, so it’ll just be seeing what comes out in the competition environment that we need to tweak or pay attention to.”One of the things Georgia head coach Danna Durante said the team still needs to work on this fall is getting into that competitive spirit.“We’ve been talking a lot the last two weeks about raising the bar,” Durante said. “They are incredibly hard workers and have been doing a really good job, but for them to see that progress, it needs to continue. Particularly for those that are working to find a spot in the lineup, the product needs to be really sharp and really clean.”On Friday, the format is set up like a normal competition except for the fact the Gym Dogs warm up and compete each event rather than warm every event up and them compete.“We all start and do a meet warm up and try and simulate it as much like a meet as possible,” Davis said. “We’ll do line drills and stretch and then get going. We’ll start on vault, and they’ll have a lineup for us. If there’s time at the end, we’ll talk about it or go back and fix what we need to fix.”Only the top seven gymnasts on each event get a chance to show their routines so the ones still trying to get into the lineup can get a glimpse of what it takes to make it into the top six.“We have a large freshman class, so it’s really important to help them understand what our standard is and what we want to look at and how we want to perform,” Durante said. “Those that are not there can see people like Chelsea, Lindsey, Kaylan and hose who really excel. They work really hard, but that vision of what Georgia looks like needs to be very clear for them. They need to be able to start taking steps in the direction of not just doing but doing great gymnastics.”Building up confidence and gaining experience is the main goal.


 


“That will be interesting to see how that lays out when they get some competitive experience,” Durante said. “It’s always different when you’re showing coach every day versus getting up and showing while everyone is watching.”The Gym Dogs also welcome Gymnastics Endowment Fund donors to watch the intrasquad.““They give us a little bit of extra energy,” Davis said. “For it to be an intrasquad day, I think it’ll help us even more to get those nerves going.”It’s a chance for those who support Georgia gymnastics to see the hard work that goes into the routines shown on the competition floor.“We’re unbelievably blessed with an incredible support system all the way around,” Durante said. “This gives them a chance to see what the program is doing. That’s why they give — so that they can get to know the athletes and feel like they’re helping them have not only a great experience but putting them on a path to championships and to greatness.”",Elizabeth Grimsley,sports,https://www.redandblack.com/sports/gym-dogs-prepare-for-first-full-intrasquad-of-the-fall/article_c00f6d44-4d7e-11e3-a7f0-001a4bcf6878.html
15-Nov-13,Auburn's run offense could give Georgia all it can handle,"Auburn’s offensive game plan won’t be much of a surprise on Saturday.The No. 7 Tigers (9-1, 5-1 SEC) love to run the ball and do it rather effectively.This season Auburn has run the ball on 71 percent of its plays while averaging 320 rushing yards per game, ranking them first in the Southeastern Conference and third nationally.


 


The Tigers utilize the rushing tandem of junior running back Tre Mason and junior quarterback Nick Marshall, who used to play for the Bulldogs (6-3, 4-2) before being dismissed from the team in 2012 for allegedly stealing from a teammate.“I know they are a heavy run team, especially the last couple weeks so you have to stop the run if you’re going to stop them,” senior safety Connor Norman said. “They have a bunch of different guys that can carry the ball so it’s obviously a big deal this week.”Mason, a Palm Beach, Fla. native, has been the Tigers No. 1 back this season and has carried the ball 181 times for 1,038 yards and 16 touchdowns on the year, averaging 103.8 ypg.But it’s Marshall that poses the bigger threat.Marshall is a dual-threat quarterback that has rushed for 734 yards and seven touchdowns this season, and is coming off a big game against Tennessee where he collected 214 yards and two touchdowns on 14 carries.With the success Marshall has displayed in his inaugural Auburn season, he is drawing comparisons to a former Auburn great.“Cam [Newton] was a much bigger man, obviously, but Nick’s just as dangerous as a runner because of his speed and agility and those types of things,” Georgia head coach Mark Richt said. “He can be just as effective as a runner. I think they’d be throwing more if they had to throw more. From the film I see, they don’t have to throw much, so they’re just running it. They are throwing some, but there are not many games where he threw over 10 passes in a game because he hasn’t had to. We know he’s a very capable passer, and the times he does throw, he’s very impressive.”Richt also explained the difficulty of defending a rushing quarterback, especially one with the athleticism of Marshall.


 


“It’s not really triple option football, but fundamentally, if a team’s quarterback can run the football, that is one less free defender who can try to make a tackle,” he said. “So let’s say that if you have 10 blockers and a quarterback that runs, there’s a blocker for 10 guys obviously, and a runner, so there’s only one unblocked guy that can make a play.”But this isn’t the first time the Bulldogs will be facing a rushing quarterback this season.Georgia has defender three dual-threat quarterbacks on the season, and has been sub-par in its efforts.Against Clemson, the Bulldogs allowed Tajh Boyd (22.78 rushing ypg) to rush for 43 yards and two touchdowns, let South Carolina’s Connor Shaw (41.67 rushing ypg) to go for 82 yards on the ground and gave up 43 rushing yards and a touchdown to Missouri’s James Franklin (48.33 rushing ypg).Having played so many running quarterbacks already, Georgia feels confident heading into Saturday’s matchup.“We have been doing better, we’ve been improving and that’s what it’s all about,” senior defensive lineman Garrison Smith said. “We’ve been getting better every week and that’s the biggest thing.”It will be especially important for the Bulldogs to play discipline and maintain their gap assignments against the Tigers to prevent any big plays.Saturday’s contest is set to be a battle between two opposing strengths as the Bulldogs have played well against the run, ranking fourth in the SEC while giving up 126 rushing ypg.

“Just play like we have been playing all year,” junior inside linebacker Amarlo Herrera said. “We have been stopping the run so we have to be physical like we’ve been playing.”",Connor Smolenksy,sports,https://www.redandblack.com/sports/auburn-s-run-offense-could-give-georgia-all-it-can/article_7b344db6-4da6-11e3-a487-0019bb30f31a.html
15-Nov-13,Gym Dogs sign two in early signing period,"The Georgia gymnastics team signed on two gymnasts Wednesday during the national letter of intent early signing period.Hayley Sanders of WOGA in McKinney, Texas, and Gigi Marino of Desert Devils Gymnastics in Scottsdale, Ariz., will join the team for the 2014-2015 season.Sanders is known for her work on the uneven and is “in a league of her own” as Georgia head coach Danna Durante puts it.


 


“Hayley is an unbelievable bars swinger,” Durante said. “She swings beautiful bars. She is strong on the other three as well, but bars is where she’s going to come in and be a 9.9, 9.95 or higher.”Sanders finished second in the country on bars at both the 2013 and 2011 Junior Olympic national championships and competed in the Nastia Liukin Cup in 2010, a competition for the nation’s top level 10 gymnasts.Marino is the power athlete of the pair with a skill set that includes a one and a half twisting Yurchenko on vault and two E-level tumbling passes on floor.“She has both a full-in and a double layout on floor,” Durante said. “That has been a bit of a weakness — that level of difficulty on the event. There’s no question there’s been great athletes, but top to bottom, one to six, we haven’t had a whole lot of difficulty.”Marino finished second on vault and sixth in the all around at the 2013 JO national championships and has qualified to the national event two other times.Her power also carries over to beam where she performs a single back handspring to a double back dismount — an extremely difficult feat that not many other gymnasts are able to do.“I don’t know if you’ve see anyone do a handspring to a double back, but it’s unbelievable,” Durante said. “She also swings very good bars, but we’ll just have to see how that event develops.”Personality-wise, both Sanders and Marino are already starting to mesh well with the current team members.


 


‘They’ll be a good combination together,” Durante said. “They had an awesome time last weekend when they came down. The team was asking if they could just come now, so I think they’ll fit really well with this group.”Sophomore Mary Beth Box described the pair as shy at first but began to open up once they became more comfortable.“Once you warm up to them, they’re awesome,” Box said. “I think they mesh pretty well. Their personalities aren’t strikingly different from anyone else on the team.”Junior Chelsea Davis had the opportunity to host Marino while she was on her official visit.“She came on an unofficial but we didn’t really get to hang out with her that much,” Davis said. “She’s just a really awesome girl, and I think she’ll bring a lot of personality to the team. She’s happy and outgoing and was really ready to interact to us. I think she should be a good addition.”More importantly, they are dedicated and have a desire to be at Georgia — something Durante said is very important in a recruit.“Hayley had a goal for herself on the SAT, didn’t quite reach it, went back in a second time and not only met that goal, but she passed it,” Durante said. “And I’m not talking about a 1200 goal. I’m talking about a wow goal, and she passed it significantly. She just loves Georgia. She has more Georgia apparel than probably the whole team combined.”On the flipside, Durante describes Marino as “fiery.”


TNCMS.AdManager.render({region: 'fixed-big-ad-bottom-asset', slot: 1, fold: ""below""});


“Gigi again is very bright, very smart and is dedicated and focused,” Durante said. She’s feisty. She’s Italian, and I love that. It brings personality to the team.”After signing Sanders and Marino, the Gym Dogs still have one scholarship spot available. However, they’re not looking to fill the place during the early period.“As fluid as recruiting is right now, we are always prepared, and we are always looking at athletes,” Durante said. “We’ve always got names on the tip of our tongues and coaches that we’re talking to and gyms that we’re in. We have a couple of those types for that third spot.”There is also a possibility that the scholarship could go to one of the walk-on athletes already on the team.“we’ve got some great athletes that are paying their way to school,” Durante said. “So that’s certainly a viable option.”But whatever Durante and the rest of the coaching staff decides to do, she wants to make sure it’s the perfect fit before making any decisions.“We’re just going to wait and not make a rushed decision,” Durante said. “It’s really all about the fit for the program. We’re going to bring what we need to complete that class, but they need to love Georgia gymnastics. That is paramount.”",Elizabeth Grimsley,sports,https://www.redandblack.com/sports/gym-dogs-sign-two-in-early-signing-period/article_18b75dda-4e10-11e3-a0e8-001a4bcf6878.html
16-Nov-13,Georgia/Auburn: Game rewind,"AUBURN, Ala. — That was one of the wildest college football game you will ever see. It's as simple as that. The improbable, 20-point comeback was usurped by the only thing that could beat it — a wacky fourth-and-18 heave by Nick Marshall that somehow landed in the arms of Auburn's Ricardo Louis.The Bulldogs, down 37-17 at one point of the fourth quarter, managed to climb out of the seeming insurmountable deficit in exciting fashion. When the Georgia defense needed to step up it did. When Aaron Murray needed to step up, he did, particularly on the gutsy 5-yard touchdown run that gave Georgia its only lead of the game.Auburn, just when it seemed impossible, bested Georgia's comeback. Looking at fourth-and-18, the game appeared all but over for an Auburn fan base that had been on the winning side for virtually the entire game. Then two Georgia defenders joined to tip a pass that deflected straight to Tigers' wide receiver Ricardo Louis (who had quite the game all around). Auburn took a 43-38 lead after a failed 2-point conversion.


 


The rest is history.PLAYER OF THE GAMEAuburn quarterback Nick MarshallThe former Georgia defensive back made the Bulldogs regret dismissing him. Marshall, who was Connor Smolensky's choice for first-half player of the game, only solidified that stance for post-game honors. The junior quarterback ran, ran and ran some more, collecting 93 yards on 15 carries and two touchdowns. But, at times, it was Marshall's passing ability that had Georgia's defense guessing. Marshall completed 12-of-19 passes for 149 yards. Those numbers (the passing ones) aren't unbelievably impressive, but the game film most certainly will be as Marshall managed to escape numerous would-be tacklers to extend both passing and running plays.Oh yeah, the crazy 73-yard touchdown heave that will be aired over-and-over on television for the rest of the college football season was pretty cool, too.OVERLOOKED PLAYER OF THE GAMEAuburn wide receiver Ricardo LouisIt's hard to consider a player overlooked with the show Louis put on in this one, but with much of the focus on Marshall and running back Tre Mason, Louis' standout performance went a little under the radar. The sophomore wide receiver caught three passes for 58 yards, including a 44-yard reception on the Tigers' first drive of the second half. That catch set up the Auburn touchdown that put the Tigers ahead 34-17. Louis earned some work in the backfield, too, chipping in on Auburn's dominant rushing campaign. His five carries averaged 13.2 yards per, giving him 66 yards on the ground.


 


Oh yeah, the crazy 73-yard reception that will be aired over-and-over on television for the rest of the college football season was pretty cool, too.KEY MOMENTAuburn's game-winning 73-yard touchdownI know I've already mentioned it three time, but come one, that was the craziest play I've ever seen live in any sporting event ever.

17-Nov-13,"Football notebook: Richt earns first-career penalty, UGA out of SEC contention","AUBURN, Ala. — Georgia head coach Mark Richt has always been known for his calm demeanor, but fans saw a different side of him in Auburn.Richt received his first ever penalty Saturday for unsportsmanlike conduct on a subject fumble recovery call.“I guess I wasn’t pleasant enough in my disagreement,” he said.


 


In a 13-7 game, No. 7 Auburn’s (10-1, 6-1 SEC) Ricardo Louis fumbled the ball after a short reception that caused, which caused some controversy.“What I saw was a set of legs, the Auburn player, his knees were bent on the ball and most of the time this [right] hand was free and he’s trying to get his other hand in there and I saw Josh Harvey-Clemons wrapped up around the ball and everything else,” Richt said. “Surely he’s got possession of the ball.”The ball was given back to Auburn and rather than Georgia (6-4, 4-3) having the ball in good field position, the Tigers were granted 15 yards and a first down, ultimately leading to a Nick Marshall touchdown run.Chris Conley back in action Georgia junior wide receiver Chris Conley played in his first game since injuring his leg on the Bulldogs’ last second Hail Mary attempt against Vanderbilt three games ago.Leading up the game Conley was listed as doubtful, but showed promise later on the week.“Not really until yesterday,” Conley said. “Thursday they let me run around a little bit and at that point they realized that I’m not at 100 percent, but I’m able to contribute.”Conley did not see his usual dosage of play, but collected two catches for 24 yards in his efforts. 


 


“It felt alright, I’m not at 100 [percent] yet, but I have enough that I can play, enough that I can contribute,” he said.Marshall gashes own recruiting classGeorgia’s “Dream Team” recruiting class finally got to play in a game with fellow member Nick Marshall.It just wasn’t the way the recruiting class would’ve expected at its inception.The former Georgia defensive back faced off against the Bulldogs as the Auburn starting quarterback, and he did so in impressive fashion.Marshall ran wild against Georgia and his passing attack wasn’t too shabby, either.Throughout the game, many members of the recruiting class chatted with Marshall after tackles, clearly displaying the joint respect the former teammates had for one another.After the game, safety Corey Moore said he walked up to Marshall with some choice words of both approval of Marshall’s play and dismay of the game’s result.

“I just told him they got away with one,” Moore said. “but it was a good game overall.”SEC title hopes over, only Kentucky leftWith a third-straight Southeastern Conference title game officially out of reach, Georgia now turns its attention to its final conference contest of the season.Next Saturday, Kentucky travels to Athens to take on Georgia for the Bulldogs’ senior night. For many players, including redshirt senior quarterback Aaron Murray, the Kentucky game will be the last time they suit up for Georgia in Sanford Stadium.“We have to realize that next week means a lot to seniors,” Murray said. “It’s the last time we can play in Sanford Stadium in front of our fans.”Georgia is no longer an SEC Championship contender, but Richt doesn’t expect that to inhibit his team’s effort and performance going forward, especially with the team’s desire to win for its seniors in their final home game.“We need to go home and get ready to honor our seniors next week for their last game between the hedges,” Richt said.",CONNOR SMOLENSKY & BENJAMIN WOLK,sports,https://www.redandblack.com/sports/football-notebook-richt-earns-first-career-penalty-uga-out-of/article_d10a51ba-4f3e-11e3-af16-001a4bcf6878.html
17-Nov-13,"Football notebook: Richt on defensive staff, Murray","The questions have only multiplied for Georgia's defense.The Bulldogs (6-4, 4-3 SEC) allowed a season-high 43 points in their loss to No. 6 Auburn on Saturday. The Tigers (10-1, 6-1 SEC), meanwhile, would cruise to 566 total yards of offense and become the seventh team to score 30 or more on UGA this season. Defensive coordinator Todd Grantham, now in the middle of his fourth year in Athens, will enter the final year of his contract when this season ends.Head coach Mark Richt was asked about his level of satisfaction with the defense and the performance of its staff. The answer was none too specific.


 


“We’re a team here at Georgia and we’re going to keep coaching and keep trying to make improvements and corrections on everything we do in all phases of the game,” he said during his weekly Sunday teleconference.Richt also fielded questions about his confidence in Georgia's defensive play-call on Auburn quarterback Nick Marshall's miraculous 73-yard touchdown pass to Ricardo Louis with 25 seconds left in the game. On the play in question, the Bulldogs had dropped eight into coverage while rushing two and setting one man on a spy. Louis wound up double-covered.“We never dreamed what happened would happen. I’m real comfortable with the call we made and when we made it. I know when it was called looking back it was the right thing to do, we just didn't execute it properly,"" Richt said.The game marked the third time this season that Georgia has lost by a score of less than one touchdown.“We need to be able to bounce back,” Richt said. “That’s the nature of the business, the nature of the game of football or competitive sports period. You lose and you got a game the next week, you got to shake it off and get back to work. Sometimes you’d like to be playing a baseball schedule after one like that where you can play the next game a little faster.”More from MurrayThough the Bulldogs wound up one wild play short of pulling off the upset in Auburn, the scenario does not come close to fruition without the help of senior quarterback Aaron Murray.Playing in the final conference road game of his college career, Murray accounted for four total touchdowns (two passing, two running) in the second half and was instrumental in guiding the offense back from its 20-point fourth quarter deficit.


 


“Murray played fantastic. Without question, just watching the tape he made some really great throws, was on top of his game,” Richt said. “A couple balls here and there that might not have been exactly where he wanted them to be, but really did a super job to lead our offensive team. Getting the score back to 38-37 was huge.”The Tampa native also totaled 415 yards passing on 33 completions. In all, he finished the day with a whopping 49 pass attempts, the most of any game in his four-year career as starter.""There may be some truth to that,"" Richt said when asked if the Bulldogs fare better when Murray throws more. ""But a lot of times as the game wears on you've gotta decide what's working best. There's been games we've run the ball extremely well. Now being behind like that it kind of forced us to throw the ball down after down.""Injury updatesSpeaking of running the ball, tailback Todd Gurley finished the Auburn game with 15 carries for 79 yards rushing and a touchdown - a quiet game by his standards.Much of that had to do with Georgia trailing by double digits for most of the game, but Richt also admitted that his leading rusher has not been completely healthy despite starting the past three games.“Certainly we know he’s not 100 percent. But he’s really gutting it out for the team and playing real hard. He’s a motivator for his teammates,” Richt said.In addition, Richt confirmed that backup tight end Jay Rome will miss the remainder of the regular season due to a foot sprain. He doubted that the injury would require any type of surgery.

17-Nov-13,"Column: Though crushing, UGA loss was epic all the same","There are those that have compared athletic competition to physical poetry — the height of kinesthetic expression whose beauty, the inherent subtleties and utmost extremes of the human body's movements, will at times shock and defy our preconceived notions of “normal.”And it’s no accident that ESPN, according to Forbes, has turned that into a $40 billion business enterprise: we devour the drama (manufactured or real) and soak up all the high-stakes madness to form something equal parts exhilarating and terrifying for ourselves, the viewers.Any person who calls him or herself a fan of the Bulldogs (6-4, 4-3 SEC) had their hearts broken again on Saturday in Georgia's 43-38 loss to No. 6 Auburn on a last-chance, jaw-dropping touchdown pass.

The feelings of frustration are natural and expected but no tougher to deal with on an occasion such as this: once again, the Bulldogs have found themselves on the losing end of another epic game.But in the aftermath of defeat, what was the so-called ""Miracle on the Plains"" if not the height of football viewership?

It seemed, as they've done before this season, that UGA's defenders had somehow made a stop when they needed one the most.Most fans could count on one hand the number of times they've seen teams convert 4th-and-18. Or at least I could. The Tigers reeked of desperation, and surely this final play was nothing more than formality.But for a Georgia team that has now allowed 12 of 18 fourth-down conversions, many third-and-long conversions and has a penchant for allowing huge passing plays (three plays of 70 yards or more this season), the wise fan knew even this was not yet a lock. Perhaps Marshall knew that.


 


And so there stood the former Bulldog, tall in the pocket as defensive coordinator Todd Grantham rushed two, left a third on QB spy duty and dropped eight into coverage. Ray Drew fought his way to within a foot of Auburn's quarterback. His counterpart, Jordan Jenkins, came close as well and dove at the signal-caller's feet as he stepped forward.Heave.Ricardo Louis is trapped. There are Georgia defenders on three different sides of him, and two leap to grab an overthrown, last-gasp pass. Tray Matthews and Josh Harvey-Clemons see not a football but the word ""UPSET"" come flying toward their waiting, airborne hands with all due haste and recklessness. The pass veers right at two sets of hands, hungry and waiting.This is the point in sports movies where the sound cuts out and everything moves in slow-motion. But more than that, you take a mental snapshot of a particular moment - the ball floating in the air, almost weightless - and savor it. Your eyes widen. Everything becomes lost in the grandness of the moment, until suddenly it's gone.Bouncing off Matthews, the pass deflects up, over and right down into Louis' hands. He wasn't expecting it. He wasn't even looking for it. It quite literally fell into his lap.""It just landed right into my hands. I saw it once it got over my shoulder. It got tipped, I lost track of it,"" Louis said to the Associated Press. ""But when I looked over my shoulders, it was right there.""There he was and there he went, dashing free to the 10-by-53.33-yard box we call ""end zone"" where dreams either crumble or somehow keep on breathing.For the Bulldogs, those dreams were struck dead, a lightning bolt sent from the only cloud in the sky with the backdrop a chorus of 87,000 astonished Auburn fans.

We would be at fault to forget that the prelude to all of this was an unlikely 20-point comeback effort by the Bulldog offense fueled mostly by Murray, who finished the day with a heroic 415-yard, four total touchdown performance under his belt.And following that miracle play, he drove Georgia within 20 yards of a last-second touchdown pass - a near one-upping of Marshall's logic-defying touchdown throw.The outcome will surely haunt him, but even so the senior undoubtedly finished his final conference road game in style - even if he can't see it just yet.""It's like a nightmare,"" Murray said. ""You try to wake up, and we are celebrating victory. It's tough. This is going to be a tough one to get over.""***Auburn, a team that went 3-9 last season, kept its title hopes alive on that play.At the other end, the dejected Bulldogs saw their upset bid stolen away in spectacular fashion, all but ending their slim-to-none odds of winning the SEC East. You could say it served as the perfect microcosm for the 2013 season. You wouldn't be remiss to say it sums up the Mark Richt era of UGA football, either: so many promising starts and a fair share of disappointing finishes, as well.But regardless of where these two teams end up – whether the Tigers lose out or the Bulldogs start winning again – this play will stand immemorial, another shining example of why so many love the game.

19-Nov-13,Food2Kids gives kids something to be thankful for this year,"Thanksgiving is just around the corner, and the University of Georgia campus is about to empty out as students return home to gather around the dinner table for a hearty meal. Imagine if you didn’t know where your next meal would come from. Unfortunately that is a reality for more than 125,000 people throughout Northeast Georgia. That is where The Food Bank of Northeast Georgia comes in.Since 1992, the food bank has worked toward ending hunger as part of an overall community effort to alleviate poverty in Northeast Georgia. Since its founding, the food bank has distributed 81 million pounds of food, which is equivalent to 67 million meals to residents experiencing food uncertainty.School is not merely a place to learn for many children throughout Northeast Georgia, it is also a reliable source of food. This means that when they leave school on Friday they may not have another meal until they return to school on Monday morning. The Food Bank of Northeast Georgia believes that this is unacceptable and therefore initiated the Food2Kids program in January 2008. Food2Kids is designed to alleviate hunger on nights and weekends when other food is not available.


 


“UGA Food2kids provides free sacks of food to students in Clarke County who are at risk of going hungry over the weekend. While the public schools offer breakfast and lunch to the most impoverished students in our community, many of these same children do not have a reliable source of food over the weekend,” said Jeffrey Sureck, UGA Food2Kids co-president. UGA Food2Kids is the UGA chapter of the organization, supporting the food bank's main group.Food2Kids aims to bridge the weekly weekend hunger gap by providing free sacks of child friendly and child specific foods that are easy to open, nutritious, and require little to no cooking (microwave only). While the majority of the food the Food Bank of Northeast Georgia receives is donated, the food for the Food2Kids program is not. This is because the program must ensure a balanced and nutritional source of food for the growing and developing children it serves.“We are all privileged to attend a university with so many resources available to us. Yet just across the street there are so many children with so much potential that are limited by factors out of their control. If we can help these children stop worrying about where their next meal is coming from, they can start focusing on other things that are important in their lives,” Sureck said.Each week volunteers pack and deliver 1,000 bags to schools throughout the community. School officials then distribute the sacks to the students.“Everyone is looking for a way to give back to the community. The UGA Food2kids program is designed to allow anyone to participate in any degree they want. What makes our club special is that the students do not volunteer just to volunteer, they do so because they truly believe in the cause and the betterment of the community,” Sureck said.Sureck and the Food2Kids executive board have planned a Thanksgiving Percentage Night that is to take place tonight at Silver Dollar Bar. The event will showcase live performances from local bands and raffle prizes donated by local vendors. All proceeds generated from this event benefits the Food Bank of Northeast Georgia and Food2Kids.“This percentage night will be a great way to supplement our bag packing efforts through the donation of all our proceeds and spreading the word about our club. We thought it would be a fun way to bring students together for a good cause,” Sureck said.The event will feature prizes from local businesses such as Onward Reserve, Trapeze, Agora, etc. Entrance to the event is free with $1 raffle tickets being sold before and during the event. In addition, drink specials will be available to entrants over 21. T-shirts will also be sold at the event.


 


“This is the first time we have planned a percentage night of this scale. The food bank and Food2Kids does have an annual concert called 'Will Rock 4 Food' that is held next semester at the Terrapin Brewery. We hope our percentage night will only be a small sample of the fun and philanthropy in store for next semester,” Sureck said.","Elizabeth Gerber

20-Nov-13,"Rantavious Wooten nearing end of a long, winding college journey","Rantavious Wooten made his first career touchdown catch against Kentucky.The year was 2009 and the pass was thrown by Joe Cox, but the senior wide receiver still remembers the play with all the vividness one would expect. And, of course, he recalls the outcome of that game just as clearly: a 34-27 home loss to the Wildcats on senior night.He’s making sure Georgia’s youngsters don’t let that memory slip away, either.


 


“It’s definitely one of those things I’ll remember for the rest of my life,” Wooten said. “I’ll tell the guys for some extra motivation that in the same situation my freshman year, a game at night, Kentucky, senior night, we started off good and Kentucky pulled off a hell of a game and ended up beating us.”Such is the wisdom that comes with age.There isn’t much the 24 year-old Wooten hasn’t seen through his five-year career with the Bulldogs (6-4, 4-3 SEC). He’s been through the lows of missing most of the 2011 season due to a concussion he suffered in a multi-car accident on Baxter Street, after which he was granted a medical redshirt. He suffered through 6-7 in 2010 and watched his team embark on an impressive 12-2 campaign last season.And like the rest of his teammates, he’s been on the losing end of a pair of unbelievable games in last year’s conference title game and last week’s “Miracle on the Plains” shootout in Auburn. His insight has only grown through the wildness of 2013, a season that has already seen six games decided by a touchdown or less – the Bulldogs losing three of them.“I just feel like the ups and downs made me who I am today, even in this last [Auburn] game. I knew it wasn’t over,” Wooten said. “If you’re used to winning and you’re put in a position like that, nobody knows how you’re going to react. It made me one of those players that knows that anything is possible, a senior that has seen it all.”Georgia has been forced to contend with multiple long-term injuries at receiver through the hardships, as well.Malcolm Mitchell and Justin Scott-Wesley suffered ACL tears that ended their seasons. Michael Bennett and Chris Conley each missed a pair of games because of injury. At one point, the receiving corps consisted of Wooten, fellow senior Rhett McGowan and a handful of young, untested players.But Wooten helped serve as the experienced glue holding an eclectic group of players together – a stabilizing, consistent producer for the bruised and battered Georgia offense perhaps at his best during last week’s 5-catch, 99-yard performance against the Tigers. Presented with the first extended playing opportunities of his college career, Wooten has caught a personal-best 24 passes for 383 yards receiving so far in his final season with the Bulldogs.


 


“[Wooten] has done well. When he’s been healthy, he’s played very well. Two seasons ago he was really ready to be a guy that would be in the rotation, make plays for us,” head coach Mark Richt said. “Watching that [Auburn] tape, he made some very tough catches for us.”Even so, the possibility of translating that into an NFL career would seem a long shot. But that still won’t deter the Belle Glade, Fla. native from trying to stick among the elite ranks of professional football once he graduates from UGA in December.“Definitely going to train. Definitely going to reflect on my career here and see the things I could improve, things I could do better and hopefully get some of those things corrected,” Wooten said. “Just trying to pursue another career in the NFL. I don’t know what’ll happen, but definitely going to give it a shot.”And if it doesn't work out?""I really don't know.""He’s not thinking too much about the future (not a first among college students). He’s not even considering how he’ll feel after the Kentucky game.“I haven’t even thought about it yet. I don’t want to think about it, really,” Wooten said. “When the moment happens, I’m pretty sure it’ll hit me hard. As of now, it’s a normal week until Saturday comes around and after the game I reflect on everything I’ve been through since becoming a Bulldog.”He and his fellow seniors simply seek to win their final home game in hopes that victory can allay some of the pain of an emotionally draining 2013. It's been a bittersweet season by all accounts for the Bulldogs.

“It is a crazy season. This is a season to remember because I can say we really fight until the end. How things go, up and down, we really stick together and fight to the end,” senior offensive tackle Kenarious Gates said.But hearing the crowd call out ""Woot!"" one more time in Sanford Stadium might make things a little bit sweeter for the well-traveled Rantavious Wooten.“Especially this season. One of those seasons, man,” he said, chuckling.",Alec Shirkey,sports,https://www.redandblack.com/sports/rantavious-wooten-nearing-end-of-a-long-winding-college-journey/article_e0f795fc-5195-11e3-af71-001a4bcf6878.html
21-Nov-13,"Turn Me On!: 'American Horror Story' stalls, but still remains engaging","After a rather uninteresting opening sequence, Murphy begins a social commentary using Madison Montgomery as a vessel.


 


In just a few short sentences, he provides the audience with a scathing criticism of Generation Y that comes awfully close to breaking the fourth wall.Swinging between the narcissism and hedonistic behaviors of the current generation, he chalks their actions up to a simple emptiness that is a direct result of familial issues in early childhood, such as abandonment.The first few minutes set up for the rest of the episode, with it stemming from those themes. Marie Laveau takes advantage of Queenie's feelings of isolation due to her race, and offers her powers stronger than those of the Supreme if she can bring her Delphine LaLaurie. Following Cordelia's revelation to Zoe that Fiona murdered Madison, the two hatch a plan to kill Fiona noting she must pay.Zoe begins the largest character development of the season thus far, becoming sinister almost immediately in a scene where she forces the truth out of the butler, Spalding, before murdering him.In a shocking conclusion, Queenie takes Madame LaLaurie to Laveau's hair salon where she is presumably murdered, and the episode is a reversal of the beginning of the season with Laveau painting her face with LaLaurie's blood.I don't know how to feel about this episode: the plot isn't advancing as fast as one would expect, with heaps of plot lines still unresolved.It's particularly frustrating as a viewer to watch several huge events occur within each episode with no immediate result. What began as a really deep episode with the power to resonate emotionally with the audience quickly soured.Every week I tell myself if nothing happens in the next episode I'm going to stop watching, and yet here I am, actively tuning in week after week.

21-Nov-13,"UGA's Portuguese program, 'second to nothing'","As host for both the 2014 FIFA World Cup and the 2016 Olympics, Brazil is poised to launch itself on the world stage in a big way. The University of Georgia’s Portuguese Flagship Program is encouraging fluency in students in a language that is becoming globally important.The Language Flagships are sponsored by the National Security Education Program, which now has 26 programs at 22 institutions in nine languages. And the University of Georgia is the only one to host a program for Portuguese.“We have a strong tradition in Portuguese at the University of Georgia. We’re one of the few universities, certainly in the southeast, that offer a graduate program — a full-fledged graduate program — in Portuguese studies,” said Robert Moser, an associate professor of romance languages and the program director. “So we’re sort of a reference around the country. The last time I checked we’re the fourth largest Portuguese program in the country as far as sheer numbers of students taking the language.”


 


Moser said they received the grant in 2011, and are working on accepting their third cohort of students. The first cohort had 12 students. This newest will have between 30 and 40.The other Flagship Programs in Georgia are the programs in Chinese at the Georgia Institute of Technology and North Georgia College and State University.“We were the first university to start up a Flagship Program in Portuguese, and we continue to be the only one,” Moser said. “And this really was a big deal because it’s arguably the largest federal grant ever given to Portuguese instruction. And that to some degree reflects just the growing importance of the language globally. “Brazil is the “B” in the BRICS — Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa — nations identified by Goldman Sachs as the up and coming world economies for 2050.Moser said there were three aspects of UGA’s Portuguese program that made it different from other programs — high proficiency standards, professionalizing language learning based on career goals and immersion in Brazil for a year for a semester abroad and an internship.Sam Eisen, director of the Language Flagship, wrote in an email to The Red & Black that UGA was an attractive candidate for a Portuguese Flagship Program for these as well as other pre-existing programs such as its K-12 outreach program and its Teletandum set up with partner school State University of São Paulo.“The goal is to graduate students with professional-level language proficiency in their target language alongside their academic major of choice,” Eisen wrote. “Flagship students major in anything from biology to business to engineering or international development. The aim is to produce a generation of language enabled graduates in a variety of academic disciplines to meet the broad needs and challenges of an increasingly global society.”Moser said most students apply as freshmen or sophomores because by the time they’re juniors, reaching the required level of proficiency to do the capstone year abroad is difficult.


 


“I think that for us the primary goal is for the student to really make a connection between their foreign language and broader ambitions they might have, either academically or professionally,” he said.Tim Heigl, a junior international affairs, romance language and Latin American and Caribbean Studies major from Zionsville, Ind., said coming from a high school immersion program in Spanish in Indiana, Portuguese was attractive.“I’ve always really loved languages and just with being able to travel and being blessed with knowing the world, I’ve seen the way that it’s been evolving and it’s really getting more and more global,” Heigl said. “And as I got to college, I kind of wanted to branch out and do something new and Portuguese was that. It’s one of the top emerging languages.”Heigl said he completed an internship this summer at the Brazilian consulate in Atlanta as part of the program and was able to practice his language skills as well as learn more about the culture.“Brazil’s one of the most unique countries in the world because it’s completely surrounded by just a bunch of Spanish-speaking countries,” Heigl said. “Every country but two in South American borders Brazil, it’s really got great relations with all its neighbors. It’s really got a bunch of diverse people. I learned from working at the consulate that no Brazilian looks like — you can’t put a stereotype to it because they come from every color and they really do. They have the largest Japanese population outside of Japan, which is surprising.”He said he thought the program was a great opportunity for everyone.“Going to Brazil for a year is second to nothing and I’m really glad that I had the opportunity to go to UGA because it’s the only one in the nation,” he said.",Jeanette Kazmierczak @sciencekaz,uganews,https://www.redandblack.com/uganews/campus/uga-s-portuguese-program-second-to-nothing/article_8e887c1a-5248-11e3-9e78-001a4bcf6878.html
21-Nov-13,"Excess and laziness, not trans fats, to blame for growing waistbands","Health fads have been prevalent since the first caveman decided to go vegan, probably much to the chagrin of his cave-wife. Since then, they’ve evolved and split into several idiosyncratic factions. I have observed three main types in my day. There’s the people who create scapegoats (i.e. trans fats, fast food, high fructose corn syrup, etc.); those who count calories like there’s no tomorrow and insist that if it isn’t grass-fed-vegan-organic-cage-free-washed-only-in-a-river-creek, it’s going to be their end; and those who work out excessively to make up for their dietary mishaps. I don’t pretend to be a nutritionist or exercise expert, but I can still make jokes about the idiotic ways of “healthy living.”Recently the U.S. Food and Drug Administration tried to ban all trans-fats. This would essentially eradicate all frozen foods, desserts and snack food products as we now know them. This is yet another attempt to purify the American diet by blaming our obesity on what we consume. The fact is that we can blame trans fats all we want, but until we accept that we are abusing these products, we will just find another way to stuff ourselves. Yes, trans fats are not the healthiest thing, but the issue truly lies with how we treat them and “junk food” in general. Our perception of food is also flawed. We act like Twinkies force our jaws open and cram themselves into our mouths while corndogs strap our ankles down to our recliner. In reality, it is our unhealthy habits that bring on our waistbands’ demise.


 


On the polar opposite end of the spectrum lie the health nuts. They munch on gluten-free-soy lettuce and eagerly pound away on the elliptical until every calorie on their body is burned to the ground. They are the people who post Pinterest workouts and go vegan for the sake of their own bodies rather than altruism. Why they work out so religiously is somewhat unclear. From an outside perspective they appear to be hamsters speeding away on level one of workout machines, all the while never truly caring about heart health or muscular strength; they just want Carrie Underwood’s legs. Somewhere in the middle lies me. I am not proud of my ways — I row and run myself crazy to make up for my dietary mishaps. Some days I have macaroni and cheese for every meal; others are waffles and oh-dear-keep-that-vegetable-away-from-me days. It’s an awful lifestyle, but it makes me happy. I enjoy being athletic and sometimes I marvel at what I could be if I ever dared to eat a salad. It is unlikely that I will ever change my ways. As long as I keep adding kilometers to my races, I proportionally add slices of pizza to my plate. But you can’t blame food for your own insecurities. Today’s health fads are obsessed with the idea of achieving the body of your dreams. That’s idiotic. No matter how hard I try, I will never have the body of John Stamos — the pinnacle of physical perfection. If we learn to stop blaming extraneous circumstances and truly understand what makes us happy, we’ll be healthier than Richard Simmons.—Courtney Willett is a freshman from Marietta majoring in pre-journalism","Courtney Willett

21-Nov-13,"After full-set intrasquad scrimmage, Gym Dogs not in top-7 push to break through","Although only the top-7 Gym Dogs on each event performed in the full-set intrasquad Friday, every member of the team is still pushing to break into the lineup.“We really wanted everybody to have a clear picture of where they are right now,” Georgia head coach Danna Durante said. “If you’re not in the top-7 but still get to show all the time, you don’t really get a clear picture of where you fit. That’s also going to push those that were in the top-7 to continue to be better.”Sophomore Anysia Unick, who competed on bars at the intrasquad, said its motivation to keep working hard because “at the end of the day you want to be the one representing the red and black.”


 


“Knowing that that’s in the coaches’ minds already makes you want to get into that seventh spot so that you can keep moving up and plugging away at the season,” Unick said. “I got the opportunity to show bars and learned a lot about myself and have that experience again — getting back into competition.”For others, watching the standards set by those in the lineup gave them a glimpse of how well they need to do in order to break into the top group.“I’ve been working beam all summer long, and to know that I’m that close but still not there makes me work that much harder,” sophomore Brandie Jay said. “The same goes for everybody on every event.”Durante also saw some timidness on some of the events that she thinks will go away with more practice.“Vault was small compared to what they’ve been training and what they’re capable of,” Durante said. “They get anxious to try to go for the landings, even at this point in the year just because it’s engrained in them. Phil’s very pleased with what he’s seeing there, but now they can think about how to use that adrenaline to their advantage and go big.”Of course, there was also a few mistakes and slips, but that’s to be expected with a month still left until the first meet.“There were some slips, but they didn’t give up, which is awesome,” Durante said. “You never give up. You always have plan B. You always work through it. When you see an athlete do that, you see she’s fighting.”While this week is the end of the Gym Dogs’ three-week training cycle with tough practices scheduled, next week will be lighter and the focus will be turned toward staring focused during the break.


 


“We’ll have Sunday, Monday, Tuesday to be light and get to do some fun stuff,” Unick said. “Then we’ll practice while we’re at home a little bit then come back and start out three-week cycle again. We finish practice at 1 p.m. on Tuesday, and we get to book flights after 5 p.m., so most of us are going home Tuesday night.”For most students, Thanksgiving break may seem like a vacation, but for the Gym Dogs it’s merely an opportunity to rest their bodies and minds.“We give them a suggested number of days we would like them to train,” Durante said. “Fitness wise, they are doing cardio and stretching and those types of things, and then there’s always the mental imagery that goes with that. We just kind of try to hammer home the fact that they have worked so hard — do not let this fall be for nothing.”After Thanksgiving, there will only be two weeks until the annual Sneak Peek, so getting down to the nitty-gritty of the routines will be a big focus.“We’re working on things like rhythm on beam whereas our skills are all there,” Unick said. “We just need to get it polished and flawless with dance and extra toes and feet pointed. Also, we haven’t focused on them a lot, but the sticks will come now that we’re getting closer to season.”Continuing to build confidence and consistence is also an important thing that can’t be pushed aside.“Getting more pressure sets under our belt is going to help a lot,” Jay said.Just putting it all together at sneak peek and putting it all together at once is something we definitely want to do.”

The team can work on these things every day in practice, but the best practice is experience in from of fans, so the Sneak Peek will be the last major checkpoint to close out the pre-season.“To have everybody here,” Jay said. “Our friends, our families, our fans — will help with our confidence and energy.”",Elizabeth Grimsley,sports,https://www.redandblack.com/sports/after-full-set-intrasquad-scrimmage-gym-dogs-not-in-top/article_722a8c58-52fb-11e3-a789-0019bb30f31a.html

26-Nov-13,UGA employee charged with sexual exploitation of a child,"Police arrested and charged a University of Georgia assistant director of development, Jeffrey Wall Delk, 51, with 43 counts of sexual exploitation of a child after searching his Wendy Lane home.Delk, who has worked for UGA since 2000, resigned Tuesday, said Tom Jackson, the University's vice president for public affairs. Delk worked as the assistant director of development for gift and estate planning. He previously worked as a development officer for the Hugh Hodgson School of Music.The Georgia Bureau of Investigation's Internet Crimes Against Children Task Force provided information about Delk to Athens-Clarke County police and UGA police. Police obtained a search warrant for Delk's home and took computers and cell phones early Tuesday.

Williamson didn't say how many computers or cell phones police took from the home, but added that in an investigation like this, it is common to remove all electronic devices that store data. Delk could face additional charges, according to the release.Delk works in UGA's Office of Development.

28-Nov-13,What your grocery cart says about you,"Since coming to college, Kroger has become my second home. I excitedly run in with my roommates, and we gawk over the cookies and pastries we shouldn't have. But after we share a very intimate food fantasies, we move along to the produce. Surprisingly, we don't see many fellow students in this section of the store. It is not until at least aisle two that we start to recognize some date night shirts and UGA spirit wear. Some say you can tell a lot by a person's shoes, but I get all the basic information from their shopping carts. There is a plethora of college shoppers that attract my inquiry, but the top five must be mentioned:1. The Frat Guy


 


Dazed and confused, these guys walk up and down the snack aisle looking for familiar labels. The cereal aisle is a safe bet; they immediately go for the Cookie Crisps as they were the forbidden fruit of their childhood. Down a few more aisles, they are able to collect plenty of chips, puffs, bars and a number of frozen pizzas. By the end of their journey, they have only racked up $30 worth of food that will last them for the next month. Thank goodness Raman was on sale for 30 cents a pack!2. The (Sort of) Health NutHas she just come from Ramsey, or is she just really into her workout gear? She meanders around the produce section — on her phone. She might pick up an apple or two. But all she can think about are the Fiber One bars that really keep her going. While she's picking those up, she notices some low calorie chips; they have no added fat! They're a must have. Next stop is bottled water, but the Diet Coke catches her eye. She figures she's staying on the healthy side with this shopping spree, so she treats herself to a tub of frozen yogurt. But of course she'll need M&Ms to go with it.3. The Ambitiously Ignorant ChefThis guy must have lost a bet. It looks like he is preparing a feast for the Hungry Hungry Hippos. He peruses the meat section, picking up ground beef, bacon and bratwurst. Befuddled, he winds up in the “house hold cleaner” aisle, not knowing what to buy next. He might pick up some deodorant on his way to the pickles. Then he'll grab a can of tuna just in case. His mom told him about a great recipe for chili, so he picks up a can of beans but forgets the rest. He walks past a bin that reads “10 for $10,” and decides this would be a good place to gorge. He goes ahead and buys 10 boxes of rice, 10 packets of instant muffin mix and way too much “onion seasoning salt” (whatever that is). I have always wondered how this guy manages to use all the things he has just bought. I imagine a really interesting, giant sandwich — if only he had remembered to buy bread.4. The Coupon FreakIs this lady about to pull out her Pokemon card collection? Oh, wait. It's just her sizable assemblage of coupons. Some people spend their time making a living or going to school, but Carrie Coupon lives her life finding the best deals. She has to stop after every aisle to look for specific coupons. But once she finds that golden ticket, she scrambles to claim her prize. She is able to buy 20 roles of toilet paper for a dollar. And the corn chips are buy one get one free — she took the liberty of getting 16 bags. 5. The Well Rounded Shopper


 


I envy this person. He shops the perimeter of the store mostly, stocking up on frozen veggies, lean beef, and greek yogurt. He may meander down the candy aisle, but of course he grabs the dark chocolate instead of the gummy bears. He buys the generic brand of coffee but doesn't skimp on the Frosted Mini Wheats. He'll grab some deli meat, low sodium soup and those razor blades he keeps forgetting. He gracefully grabs Kroger by the horns and shows it who's boss. I will always wish I could shop as productively. It's easy to get caught up in the carbohydrate filled temptation of any grocery store. I know I always get stuck in the aisles I don't need to be in. But if you eat before you shop, stay along the periphery of the store and stay away from overly-processed foods, you'll be golden.  —Megan Smith is a sophomore from Alpharetta majoring in journalism","Megan Smith

1-Dec-13,"'It's Not You, It's Me' dives into difficult truths of relationships","“It’s not you, it’s me” — words that hundreds of girls have heard from guys when they are being dumped. Nathan Ives takes a new perspective on these words, making them true in his latest film, ""It’s Not You, It’s Me."" The film follows the lives of two people, Dave (Ross McCall) and Carrie (Joelle Carter) as they adjust to their recent break-up.Carrie, shocked when Dave tells her that he wants to end their relationship, acts as any stereotypical girl would, she cries. She cries, pleads with Dave to change his mind and repeatedly asks him why? Like a typical guy, Dave uncomfortably pats Carrie and attempts to comfort her with cliché phrases like the title of the film.In a fashion very similar to ""He’s Just Not That Into You,"" a romantic comedy about a girl in her 20s attempting to navigate the world of dating, the scenes of the movie are interrupted by moments when seemingly random people talk about their own dating experiences and give advice to the viewer. Except in this film, the advisers are in the minds of Carrie and Dave instead of actual people in the world. These people act as different facets of Carrie and Dave’s personality (think angel and devil on your shoulder type of scenario). Each person has his or her own distinct personality and advises Carrie or Dave differently.


 


Throughout the film, these “people” guide Carrie and Dave in the aftermath of their breakup. Carrie jumps right into dating again, because the crazy side of her (personified as a girl in a straight jacket) convinces her that she needs to find a man, and quick, or she will end up being a cat lady. Dave, however, in a stereotypical male way, goes to a bar to drink and have sex with a random girl, because the hormonal-driven side of him convinces him that he needs to embrace his newly found freedom.Like many romantic comedies, Dave, of course, turns it all around. He starts going to therapy to work out his mommy issues so that he can “learn to love”. Unlike most rom-coms, this film destroys any overly romantic notions of love. ""It’s Not You, It’s Me"" dives right into the ugly, sad and extremely difficult parts of relationships.Although the ending may be predictable and a bit cliché, it shows that relationships are tough, but with a lot of effort and some therapy, you can make them work. Dave and Carrie show us that the key is to successful relationships is to work on changing and improving yourself, not the other person. Because sometimes, when a guy says, “It’s not you, it’s me,” it might actually be true.","Shelby Eggers

2-Dec-13,The Jive Aces jump the pond donned in distinctive yellow suits,"The band isn’t hard to recognize — yellow suits tend to attract attention. But the six members of The Jive Aces, an all-male jive band, are OK with being recognized. They are just happy to be doing what they love.The band started with a common love for jazz.“We’ve always loved this music and there was a little gang of us and we used to go around watching big bands play hard jazz and stuff. We had a little dance team and we used to jive in front of the bands. We so loved the music. It inspired us to start playing the music,” said John Fordham, the band’s saxophone player.


 


The band started in London in 1989. It played its first concert in Paris the same year. Since then, The Jive Aces have been semi-finalists on last year’s “Britain’s Got Talent” and performed for the queen.The band’s music video, “Bring Me Sunshine”, has almost 2.5 million views on YouTube. The band’s signature yellow suits fit the upbeat tone of its music and most people cannot imagine the band without the suits. But the story behind them isn’t what most people expect.“We did an album called 'Bolt from the Blue' a little while back. On the album, the record company designed the background, it was a blue background and they had us in red suits. The red didn’t go with the blue, so they made the suits yellow suits and so we had to buy these yellow suits. And so it was kind of by accident,” Fordham said. “But then we did a tour around Europe and realized that people remembered the yellow suits. They would say, ‘Where’s the band in the yellow suits?’”Fordham, who now owns “three or four” yellow suits, said that people always ask the band at the end of a night’s show, “Where do you get your energy from?”And the answer is a lot tamer than one may expect from musicians.“We enjoy what we do and we put a lot of energy into it, and we create the music together and we enjoy putting it out on the stage as a unit. Just really giving the audience a fun time,” Fordham said.The band is working on its next album, which is expected to be out near the middle of next year. The band’s Christmas EP, “Christmas Is Where You Are”, which features the band’s original song, “Christmas Is Where You Are” and four other traditional songs, is available now to buy on iTunes.The Christmas EP is benefiting the Not Forgotten Association charity, a charity dedicated to helping wounded soldiers.

5-Dec-13,Music Notes: Dec. 5-7,"Even though finals are upon us, don't let this weekend go to waste.

This weekend a variety of bands will grace the stages of Athens.Thursday, Dec. 5Sol Driven Train: This funk band will play at the Georgia Theatre at 7 p.m. for $15. Sol Driven Train was formed and is still based in Charleston and it claims its style is eclectic enough to include influences ranging from African-Caribbean rhythms, Paul Simon and New Orleans jazz.

Justin Townes Earle: This country artist will play The Melting Point at 7 p.m. for $17 in advance or $20 at the door.

He is an entertainer as well as a musician.Friday, Dec. 6Dana Swimmer: This local band will play at the 40 Watt Club at 9 p.m. for $5. The band has an upbeat rock vibe. Everyone took notice after Dana Swimmer released its debut album ""Veloce"" in February. The band's modern rock sound has made it one of the sweetheart small bands that are typical of Athens. Another local niche band, Boomfox, will also join the show. Boomfox has heavier beats and more of a punk rock influence, but the two new bands are a perfect pair for the show. Two other bands, Wanderwild and New Wives, will also play.Colonel Bruce Hampton: This unconventional performer will play Hendershot's Coffee Bar at 8 p.m. for $10. Bruce Hampton has quite a varied history in the music business. He has been a starting member of almost 10 bands, with such names as The Codetalkers and The Quark Alliance.

His shows are known to include rare instruments such as a ""chaxoid,"" a dwarf guitar.Saturday, Dec. 7Easter Island: This show will start at 9 p.m. at The World Famous for $5. Easter Island is a local band that doesn't feel that local anymore after the national attention it received from its South by Southwest performance this year. The group's smooth rock, sweet lyrics and uplifting tone are easy to listen to. It's no surprise the band members have thrived for a few years on their musical careers alone. The band is a duo of brothers who want to make the world a better place with their sound. They always strive to reinvent their sound with each record and so far that makes three, with a new two-track EP on the way. The band's earnest effort to keep its sound fresh has paid off.New Madrid: This band will play at Caledonia Lounge at 9 p.m. for $5 in advance, $7 for those over 21 and $9 for those 18 to 20 years old. New Madrid is a mix of rock and atmospheric music. The band's style is typically songs with drawn-out lyrics that carry on over strong lead guitar melodies. The band's sound carries a groove that's hard not to sway to. Two other experimental rock groups, What Moon Things and Velocirapture, will join the show.",Hilary Butschek @hilarylbutschek,variety,https://www.redandblack.com/variety/music-notes-dec/article_f80cd2a6-5d58-11e3-b3d4-0019bb30f31a.html
6-Dec-13,"With finals in full swing, Gym Dogs experience more individual practice time","Balancing finals, school work and the upcoming season can be a tough task. But for the Georgia gymnastics team, it’s an opportunity for the gymnasts to work out individually and focus on themselves for a change.“They’ve scheduled practice kind of around when finals are, but for the most part it’s individual,” sophomore Brittany Rogers said. “But it’s a good change to focus more on yourself and your needs on top of the teams.”It also gives the Gym Dogs some time for individual attention so that they can focus on some of their own corrections and nitty gritty details.


 


“It’s nice that you can get one-on-one time with the coaches,” freshman Morgan Reynolds said. “But it’s different because there’s not as much cheering because everyone’s not working out together.”At the beginning of the week, it was practice as usual with the normal schedule in effect during the last days of classes. However, coming off of Thanksgiving break made the work done in the gym anything but easy.“Monday we showed floor, which was a really big step because we just had Thanksgiving break,” junior Chelsea Davis said. “Sometimes people think we might get to ease into stuff, but we definitely hit the ground running. Everybody really rose to the occasion and hit.”On Tuesday it was more of the same but with a different event.“Tuesday we showed beam, so that was just another opportunity,” Davis said. “There were a lot of people in the lineup because it was just hard to choose. Everybody hit that too. It just shows that no matter the break, we can be ready.”The rest of the week was different than normal, with people in and out of the gym at all times throughout the day.“[Wednesday] was optional,” Reynolds said. “If we have two finals one day, we were supposed to come in then. We just come in and get our assignment done and then go study or take your final.”Balancing everything can be tough, but learning how to manage it is all a part of the process.


 


“It’s a lot, but when I’m at the gym I just think about doing gymnastics and then after that I completely focus on studying,” Reynolds said. “I just focus on things one things at a time.”No matter what, the coaching staff tries to implement measures to insure a high success rate in and out of the gym.“The coaches are really good about prioritizing with tutoring and finals, so it’s made it easier to have that support system, but it’s kind of overwhelming,” Rogers said. “I’ve taken five classes this semester, and I think my brain’s back in Canada right now. I’m trying so hard to focus. But it’s really challenging — I’ll admit that.”And for others, the stress is still to come.“For some reason, I haven’t started freaking out about finals yet, which I really should start,” Davis said. “I’ve been getting enough sleep and have been coming back into practice fully, so that’s my main focus right now.”After finals are complete, the Gym Dogs will turn their full attention to the upcoming Sneak Peek set to take place Dec. 14 at 10 a.m.",Elizabeth Grimsley,sports,https://www.redandblack.com/sports/with-finals-in-full-swing-gym-dogs-experience-more-individual/article_e649d94c-5e3e-11e3-aeb8-001a4bcf6878.html

20-Dec-13,UGA’s Grady College named one of top three journalism schools in the country,"The Grady College of Journalism and Mass Communication at the University of Georgia was named one of the top three journalism schools in the country according to a survey by the Radio Television Digital News Association.   Grady College was named the third top school behind the University of Missouri at Columbia School of Journalism and Northwestern University Medill School of Journalism. Dean Charles Davis accepted the leadership position of Grady College in July 2013 after spending nearly 14 years at Missouri’s journalism school.The annual survey sponsored by RTDNA garnered 1,321 votes.

Had the weather cooperated on Sunday, Richt said the team would have done some conditioning work, but unfortunately for the Bulldogs heavy rains drowned out any chances of practicing.Nebraska, Georgia’s opponent in the TaxSlayer.com Gator Bowl, moved its practice to 1:00 p.m. Georgia plans to resume practice Monday morning in preparation for its game against the Cornhuskers on Jan. 1 at Everbank Field.",Raleigh Harbin,sports,https://www.redandblack.com/sports/georgia-football-unable-to-practice-sunday/article_d2a88cfc-70b4-11e3-a04b-001a4bcf6878.html

8-Jan-14,Top 10 biggest UGA sports moments of 2013,"As Georgia’s athletic teams continue their seasons into 2014, it’s important to remember the year that has passed.It was a year of ups and downs featuring both victories and heartbreaking defeats, but some moments outshined others.1. Aaron Murray’s record-setting senior year performance


 


Heading into 2013 the general consensus was that Aaron Murray couldn’t win the big game. That was really the only knock on the Georgia four-year starter, but he silenced his critics and made a strong name for himself to NFL scouts during his senior year. Murray was left with almost nothing as Georgia offensive weapons dropped with injuries nearly every game, but he still managed to make his last year under center something special. Murray led the Bulldogs to big wins over South Carolina and LSU, and brought them back when nobody thought they had a chance against Tennessee. He broke four Southeastern Conference records becoming the leader in completions (921), total offense (13,554 yards), touchdown passes (121) and passing yards (13,166). Murray never took any credit for his accomplishments and will leave Georgia as one of the most prolific passers of all time.2. Georgia hosts ESPN College GameDay for game against LSUThe GameDay curse was broken in 2013. Before Sept. 28, the Georgia football team posted a 3-12 record when featured on ESPN’s College Gameday. When Georgia played LSU in week four, GameDay took over Myers Quad and brought the Bulldogs uncharacteristic good luck as they beat the Tigers 44-41. It marked the first time GameDay had been back to Athens since 2008, and Georgia fans may not be so hesitant next time.“I think the game environment needs to be the most important,” ESPN’s David Pollack said in September.“It is a huge honor to be out there and be lucky enough to play four years here and that’s the biggest thing,” Murray said of his time as Georgia's leader back in November. “You have to be able to go somewhere and play for a significant amount of time, and I’ve had that opportunity here. I get to play in a great offense that really allows me to move the ball around and make plays with great [players] around me.”3. Georgia women’s swimming and diving team wins NCAA Championship


 


After falling a place short two years in a row, the Georgia women’s swimming and diving team won the NCAA National Championship. The Bulldogs topped the California Bears 477-393 to win their fifth title and first in eight years. Following the meet, head coach Jack Bauerle was named the National Coach of the Year for the sixth time.“It’s almost impossible to describe how incredible this feels,” former Lady Bulldog Allison Schmitt said. “We all love being a part of a team, and winning a team title means so much more than any individual title ever could. I am blessed to be a member of this team. This is a night that I will never, ever forget.""4. Aaron Murray tears ACL on senior nightFor as good of a senior season as Murray displayed, it’s a shame it had to end like it did. In his last home game at Georgia against Kentucky the senior quarterback suffered and injury that a couple of his teammates had earlier in the year. Murray tore his ACL on the first play of the second quarter but continued to play on it. It was 13 plays later that he felt it pop at the end of a 28-yard run. Murray waved off trainers and convinced coaches to let him play until he could no longer bear the pain after being thrown down by Kentucky’s Za’Darius Smith. Just a terrible way to end a great career.“It’s like a fairy-tale gone wrong for Murray,” Murray’s back-up Hutson Mason said. “You hate for something to end like that on senior night at home at the end of the season.""5. Nick Marshall touchdown pass to Ricardo Louis on fourth-and-18 to beat UGA in Auburn, Ala.


TNCMS.AdManager.render({region: 'fixed-big-ad-bottom-asset', slot: 1, fold: ""below""});


Remember in the beginning of the article when I mentioned heartbreak? This is it. To think that Auburn was in the national championship because of one tipped pass against Georgia is sickening. After coming back from a 20-point deficit in the fourth quarter at Auburn, the Bulldogs were within 18 yards of knocking off No. 7 Auburn and keeping Georgia’s SEC title hopes alive. On a fourth-and-18 from the Auburn 27-yard line, Tigers quarterback Nick Marshall heaved a ball downfield into double coverage that was tipped and landed in the hands of Ricardo Louis for a 73-yard touchdown pass to give Auburn a 43-38 lead and eventual victory. It wasn't the greatest moment, but memorable nonetheless.“That was just a miracle,” safety Corey Moore said after the loss. “It is what it is, we played a great game overall, we fought back as a team like one unit and we never gave up and kept our poise. A play like that, it was just unbelievable.”6. Lady Dogs' Elite Eight finishThe Georgia women’s basketball team caught the eyes of Georgia fans in 2013, and rightfully so. The Lady Dogs finished 2013 winning 28 games and were just three points away from seeing their first NCAA Final Four appearance since 1999. Georgia received a No. 4 seed in the 2013 NCAA Tournament and beat Montana and Iowa State before upsetting No. 1 Stanford in the Sweet 16. The Lady Dogs led for most of the game against No. 2 California in the Elite Eight, but suffered a 65-62 overtime loss to the Bears. Although women’s basketball isn’t the most popular sport at Georgia, winning gets you recognized.7. Georgia men’s swimming and diving team’s Harlem Shake video The No. 7 moment of 2013 had absolutely nothing to do with winning or losing, but instead, dancing (if you can call it that). The Harlem Shake, a dance to Baauer’s song sharing the same name, invaded the nation in 2013 with viral videos consisting of ridiculous props and costumes. One dancer would initiate the dance with a crowd to follow him, and the group would go as crazy as possible for about 30 seconds. The Georgia men’s swimming and diving team took the phenomenon one step further when they conducted theirs underwater.  The clip got more than 2 million views on YouTube in just two days, and was picked up by the Today Show.

“We all thought like 20,000 [views] was our goal,” said sophomore swimmer Conor Sweeney said last March. “We were like freaking out after 100 views and all of a sudden it was put on websites and it hit over 100,000 over night and now it’s almost 2 million, in [two days]. It’s so funny, just blowing up like this.”8. Kentavious Caldwell-Pope drafted 8th overall by the Detroit PistonsKCP is one of a few names that will be remembered around Georgia men’s basketball, and for good reason. During his sophomore season Caldwell-Pope became the first SEC Player of the Year since Dominique Wilkins, was voted onto the AP All-SEC First Team and averaged 18.5 points per game. He decided to leave for the NBA after his second season, and was drafted with the eighth overall pick to the Detroit Pistons.“He really has enjoyed playing here and he has an opportunity to pursue his life long dream so he has chosen to do that,” Georgia head coach Mark Fox said last May.9. Georgia lineman Kolton Houston’s NCAA eligibility reinstatedKolton Houston got his wish in 2013. After three years of suspension for continually failing an NCAA drug test. The drug was determined to be medically administered following shoulder surgery in high school, but still prevented him from seeing the field. On July 25, Kolton’s birthday, he was told that he passed his drug test and could be reinstated. During the season Houston played a significant amount on the offensive line.

Georgia football 34-31 overtime win against TennesseeThe Bulldogs may have lost four players to injury in this game, including season-ending injuries to Keith Marshall and Justin Scott-Wesley, but it was a great game nonetheless. Georgia was ranked No. 6 at the time and went into Knoxville and stole a game from the Volunteers with an overtime victory. The game was crucial at the time to maintain a conference lead in the SEC East, and a Pig Howard turnover on the goal line in overtime gave Georgia a chance to win it. After the turnover, Marshall Morgan kicked a 42-yard field goal to win it for the Bulldogs. Just another exciting game that was the 2013 Georgia football season.“They could have easily won the ball game,” tight end Arthur Lynch said in November. “Can’t really blame [Howard] for that, he’s just trying to make a second effort for the end zone like anyone else would.

10-Jan-14,Holiday hubbub arrives earlier each year,"Over the winter break, I decided to be a productive member of society and pick up some shifts at my old job back home instead of laying on my couch, watching old reruns of “Grey’s Anatomy” or “Modern Marvels” in my pajamas for three weeks.I work as a cashier for a retail store, and I have held that job for so long that the nightmarish insanity of the holiday shopping season doesn’t even faze me anymore. I am used to the never ending phone calls asking for products that have been sold out for week, the agitated price haggling over the last Christmas tree display and the boiling rage over the fact that wrapping paper, tissue paper and gift bags are not included in the 50 percent off Christmas décor promotion. However, in all of this holiday chaos there was only one thing that caught me off guard this season, the fact that on Dec. 23, two days before Christmas, Easter decorations were already on the sale floor.


 


I understand that some people like to stay ahead of the game, but this seems a bit excessive. Customers were so confused that they thought it was left over from last Easter and thought it was on sale.Valentines decorations were on sale at the beginning of December. What’s the rush?Consumerism seems to be fast forwarding the calendar a little too quickly for my taste. Society has been left with no time to recover from the rush of the Christmas season before it is time to dive into the next holiday. Come on, retailers; give me a little break to get over another Christmas of being single before you throw Valentine’s Day in my face. The longer I have to look at Valentine’s Day decorations, the more I am depressed and the more chocolate I eat, which completely is counterproductive to my New Year’s resolution.All I want to do after Christmas and New Year’s is relax, take it easy and try not to cry about the upcoming semester, not sift through decorations for holidays that are months away. So please, for the sake of my sanity as a cashier and as a consumer, please wait an appropriate amount of time after the holiday season before you try to sell me more décor that I don’t need.—Sarah Lane is a junior from Rome majoring in communication studies","Sarah Lane

10-Jan-14,UGA men's basketball hones in on Alabama,"The Georgia men’s basketball team pulled off the improbable with an upset over No. 21 Missouri Wednesday night. As Alabama travels to Athens for a Saturday game, it’s time to forget.“We’ve forgotten about the Missouri game now,” junior forward Nemanja Djurisic said. “We’re trying to really concentrate hard on Alabama and really come out strong and do everything we can in our power to win.”Emotions ran high after the upset, drawing national attention. However, the team has to re-focus in order to prevent Alabama from taking advantage of a potential distraction and stealing a winnable game for the Bulldogs.


 


“We have a lot of leaders and upperclassmen who’s been doing good and just making everybody’s head level,” sophomore guard Charles Mann said. “We’ve just got to drop the last one and worry about the next one. We can’t dwell on the last victory.”The team can, however, draw several positives from the Missouri win. Despite having one of its worst shooting performances for much of regulation and shooting 50 percent from the free-throw line, the Bulldogs knocked off a ranked opponent and played solid defense.“We haven’t played that good of a game but from the other standpoint we really were good on defense and we showed some toughness throughout the whole game,” Djurisic said.Defense and rebounding have been two of the heaviest talking points for head coach Mark Fox all season, and for good reason. The Bulldogs have outrebounded their opponent in every win this season and are just 2-6 when allowing more than 60 points in regulation.“In order to win and to be successful in the league, we’ve got to play like that, we’ve got to play D,” Mann said. “Defense and rebounding, that’s what gives you the chance to win the game and that’s what we’ve got to do in order to win.”Alabama will present a different set of challenges for the Georgia defense. Alabama excels with above-average speed and a strong perimeter shooting game behind senior guard Trevor Releford.“Alabama [has] great speed,” Fox said. “Releford is putting up first-round draft pick type numbers. He’s shooting over 40 percent from three. You talk about having a senior point guard who’s played so many minutes and that’s like having a fourth-year quarterback who’s just been through a ton of battles.”",Cody Pace,sports,https://www.redandblack.com/sports/uga-men-s-basketball-hones-in-on-alabama/article_a6805960-7a47-11e3-a154-001a4bcf6878.html
11-Jan-14,UGA women's swimming and diving finish in a tie with Texas A&M;,"Georgia men’s swimming and diving team found a way to earn the victory while the Lady Bulldogs found themselves in a top-5 shootout against Texas A&M on Friday at the Student Rec Center Natatorium.The fourth-ranked Lady Bulldogs and the No. 2 Aggies ended up in an unusual 150-150 tie. Georgia advanced to 7-0-1 on the season and 3-0-1 in the Southeastern Conference, while the Aggies went to 4-0-1 and 2-0-1. This marks the second tie in the history of Georgia’s program, which dates back to 1973. The 1982 Georgia-Tennessee meet finished 74-74.The No. 10 Bulldogs advanced to 7-1 and 3-1 in SEC competition, while the Aggies fell to 1-2 and 0-2 with Georgia's men's team coming out on top at a 173-127 decision.


 


The women’s meet came down to the very last race: the 400 freestyle relay. Texas A&M won in 3:17.89 and Georgia was second in 3:18.74, giving the Aggies a 150-148 edge. The Lady Bulldogs’ relay of Jessica Graber, Lauren Harrington, Jordan Mattern and Amber McDermott touched in at 3:22.67 for a three-100ths of a second edge over A&M and the final critical two points of the meet.The Lady Bulldogs trailed by as much as 19 points three times on Friday. However, they made a comeback with wins in four straight events: McDermott in the 500 freestyle, Harrington in the 100 butterfly, Laura Ryan on the 1-meter springboard and Melanie Margalis in the 400 individual medley, setting the tone for the final relays.Margalis and Ryan both won twice for the Lady Bulldogs. Margalis clinched the 200 backstroke with a season-best time of 1:55.99 and went 4:10.47 in the 400 individual medley, winning by more than five seconds. Ryan earned both springboard titles, taking the 1-meter with 308.71 points and the 3-meter with 366.52 points.The 200 freestyle title was claimed by Shannon Vreeland, who reached the wall in 1:47.37. McDermott finished with a time of 4:45.09 to win the 500 freestyle. Brittany MacLean paced the field in the 1,000 freestyle, stopping the clock in a season-best 9:40.18. Harrington finished in 54.40 to claim a victory in the 100 butterfly.Nicolas Fink, Matias Koski and Ty Stewart all won three events for the Bulldogs. Fink won out in the breaststroke races in 55.88 and 2:04.01, respectively. Koski took the 200 freestyle in 1:38.29 and led a 1-2-3 effort by the Bulldogs in the 500 freestyle with a time of 4:27.19. Stewart claimed the 200 butterfly in 1:48.34 and the 400 individual medley in 3:55.47.Andrew Gemmell won the 1,000 freestyle in 9:14.27 to ignite a 1-2-3 finish by the Bulldogs as well. Taylor Dale touched first in the 100 backstroke with a time of 48.92. Jared Markham won the 200 backstroke in 1:48.27 and Pace Clark took the 100 butterfly in 49.16. The 200 medley relay of Dale, Fink, Doug Reynolds and Michael Trice clinched the win with a time of 1:29.32.“What a memorable meet that was,” Harvey Humphries, Georgia’s Senior Associate Head Coach said. “I’m just so proud of our kids for the maturity they showed. No one ever let up and they raced hard all the way through. This was a meet of character. Everyone gave it all they had.”Georgia will continue its travel of the Lone Star State by arriving at Texas on Saturday for its 11 a.m meet. The Lee and Joe Jamail Texas Swimming Center will host the venue for the women’s NCAA Championships in March.

14-Jan-14,Scouting report: Shattle Fenteng,"The University of Georgia’s lone junior college commitment, Shattle Fenteng is ranked by ESPN as the best cornerback hailing from the junior college ranks for the class of 2014. Quick, rangy and physical, there is a lot to like about the transfer from Hutchinson Community College in Hutchinson, Kan. Measuring in at 6-foot-1, Fenteng is sufficiently instinctive to start day one in the FBS. However, he does have some limitations which may earn him either a role on special teams, or possibly a first-season redshirt.Strengths:Fenteng is already big for a cornerback, but his speed does not suffer. Fenteng has a quick initial burst both when playing the receiver and when the ball is in his hands. He does a good job of keeping his eyes on the receiver rather than playing the quarterback’s eyes; looking in the backfield can often mean disaster for a defensive back. One factor of Fenteng’s game which may go unnoticed is his arm strength. Fenteng wields the ability to shove offensive players out of the way when shedding blocks as if he is swatting a fly. The Loganville native also uses his arm strength to lock up on receivers when he is in press coverage. He has above average ball skills and can be physical at times as a tackler.


 


Weaknesses:Fenteng has technical issues as a defender. He is quick to abandon his backpedal, meaning he often turns his head solely to the receiver, playing the motion of the player rather than the ball. This is a quick way to get called for pass interference at the NCAA level. Additionally, Fenteng hits high and rarely wraps up when tackling, favoring instead the highlight tackle with just a shoulder or his arms. As Georgia freshman safety Quincy Mauger showed in the Gator Bowl, this is not a reliable or successful tactic. Finally, at the more simplified junior college level, Fenteng was very rarely asked to drop back into zone coverage, manning up against a single receiver nearly every play. Though the cornerback excels at man coverage, the gap in his experience will likely inhibit or altogether stunt his growth at the next level.Final Take: Fenteng is an athletic marvel who may be able to fill a huge need for the Bulldogs in 2014. Long and quick, it is conceivable that Fenteng could possibly even play free safety instead of corner due to his combination of size and speed. In all likelihood though, Fenteng will compete with players like rising sophomores Shaq Wiggins and Brendan Langley for the second cornerback position. Because a corner who is over 6-feet tall and still possesses fluid hips is tough to come by, Fenteng likely will see at least a role in the rotating stable that is Georgia’s secondary. However, Fenteng is raw. If he continues to play using only his instincts, Fenteng will not be a two-year stopgap at defensive back as he is expected to be. Rather, it is more likely that Fenteng will contribute to the already pervasive culture among Bulldog defensive backs that form and function are afterthoughts to size and speed. If Fenteng can learn to tighten up his technique and tackle more consistently, he could become an elite defender in the Southeastern Conference. If not, Fenteng will become just another average defensive back jockeying for playing time in an under-performing secondary.",Nick Suss,sports,https://www.redandblack.com/sports/scouting-report-shattle-fenteng/article_864667ba-7cdc-11e3-8bfe-001a4bcf6878.html
15-Jan-14,Transfer students take steps to adjust to UGA,"Transferring schools may be a complicated process, but the choice is not always in vain for University of Georgia students.Natasha Levy, a sophomore, said the University of Alabama offered a transition from her hometown of Malibu, Calif. to the deep South.“I chose Alabama for my first year because I felt that it would be a good stepping stone since coming from California was a culture shock,” Levy said. “I was able to adjust to everything down here in the South and came to UGA as soon as I could.”


 


Her choice of major, she said, had a significant role in her choice to switch schools.“I was an athletic training major at Alabama, which has an amazing program that works side by side with their athletics department,” Levy said. “But when I changed my major during the summer to management information systems, I kind of knew that I would have to make a change to go to a business school that would make me stand out on a résumé, and [the Terry College of Business] was one of those schools. Ultimately UGA offered me a more promising future as an MIS major.”Area of study is a common reason students transfer, said Nancy McDuff, associate vice president for admissions and enrollment management.“In talking to transfers, we’ve found many switch schools because of a specific academic program we have,” she said.“For example, UGA has one of the only poultry science schools in the state.”Out of the top eight out-of-state schools students were transferring from to come to UGA in 2012, four were in the Southeastern Conference, including the University of Alabama, the University of South Carolina, Auburn University and the University of Kentucky, according to UGA’s transfer student profile, a website providing information about past and current transfer students.The top three in-state schools UGA transfer students applied from in 2012 were Gainesville College, Georgia Perimeter College and Georgia Southern University.The average GPA of UGA transfer students was a 3.4 in 2012, and the top three intended majors were business, biology and psychology.


 


The requirements to be admitted as a transfer student are rigorous, McDuff said.“To be eligible, students completing 30 hours of coursework must have a 3.2 GPA and students with 60 hours must have at least a 2.8 GPA,” McDuff said. “This meets requirements, but doesn’t guarantee admission.”For first-years, the evaluators look at standardized test scores, grades earned in high school courses and other factors, which is different from transfer applications.“We believe the best predictor of success in college is success in college so we look at hours attempted from an accredited institution and grades earned,” McDuff said.Approximately 1,385 transfer students entered UGA in the summer and fall of 2012, according to the admissions website.Comparatively, the number of students enrolled as transfers has remained steady throughout the years.According to the 2012 UGA Fact Book, 1,121 students enrolled as transfers in 2011 and 1,196 started as transfers in 2010.About 1,000 new students entered UGA in January, McDuff said, and upon graduation, many will not have begun freshman year together.

“When you graduate, about one-third of your classmates will have started their undergraduate career somewhere else,” McDuff said.Freshman Katie Cline transferred to UGA this semester from Columbus State University because she questioned the value of her degree from her first college.“I considered staying at Columbus State, but I didn’t think I would get very far with a degree from such a small school,” said Cline, an English major from Columbus.She applied regular decision and was admitted for the spring semester.“I was right smack on the borderline for SAT scores and GPA. I really had no idea if I would get in,” Cline said.She was also accepted to Georgia State University but chose UGA because of the greater prospects available here.“I wanted a big, prestigious, well-known type of school. I plan to move to New York City and work for Random House Publishing, and UGA is a respected southern school that would be known anywhere in the country,” she said.Cline said it was good she started at UGA her second semester because she couldn’t have imagined adjusting to multiple changes at once.

The transition since being to UGA has been easier than expected, she said.“I think spending the semester at home while attending college for the first time made the adjustment coming here easier,” Cline said.Erin Cork, a transfer counselor and academic evaluator, said there are sources to help students make the shift into a new school.“Franklin College [of Arts and Sciences] is an excellent resource for integrating students onto campus,” Cork said.While recruitment to UGA is different for transfer students than for freshmen, Cork said the admissions team works with other schools so they are well educated about UGA’s policies and programs.“We work with the University Systems of Georgia schools,” Cork said.“We inform them of the Georgia requirements so it makes the transition for transfer students go smoothly.”",Michelle Baruchman @mlbaruchman,uganews,https://www.redandblack.com/uganews/campus/transfer-students-take-steps-to-adjust-to-uga/article_92d582ee-7d6e-11e3-93ee-001a4bcf6878.html
16-Jan-14,UGA uses technology advances to research dementia,"One out of every eight older Americans will develop Alzheimer’s disease, according to the Alzheimer’s Association. One of the major symptoms of Alzheimer’s is dementia, a group of symptoms that can include memory loss and deteriorating ability to complete normal activities.University of Georgia researchers are leading two projects looking into ways to use mild cognitive impairment — or changes significant enough to be noticed by family and caregivers but not serious enough to impede the patient’s independent functioning — as a predictor for dementia.“When we think about the typical Alzheimer’s disease, we think about memory impairment — kind of the classic memory, what we call episodic memory or semantic memory as well — when you look in the brain, there are certain areas that’s associated with the median temporal lobe in particular,” said Stephen Miller, a professor of psychology and director of the Bio-imaging Research Center.


 


Miller is leading a project that uses fMRIs to scan the brains of patients showing signs of mild cognitive impairment to assess activity in the lateral temporal lobe, which is where working memory abilities are housed. Miller said his research team considered the ability to “manipulate information on the fly” just as important as traditional memory.“We’re finding that we can look in the brain and find in fact their brain is working harder during that task than individuals who are not showing these very early signs of dementia,” he said. “And so we think that that task, both outside the scanner but particularly showing evidence within the scanner, may be another marker of this very early sign of a dementing illness beginning.”The project involved monitoring brain activity in patients completing a series of increasingly difficult working memory problems using an fMRI or functional magnetic resonance imaging scanner. The fMRI measures subtle changes in oxygenation in different areas of the brain. Miller and his team then superimposed the pictures on traditional, structural MRI scans of the patient’s brain to determine which areas are being activated.Miller said the brains of patients experiencing early symptoms of MCI appear to have to work harder to complete these working memory tasks, but he emphasized the need to repeat the study multiple times and that this is not the only potential marker for early signs of dementia.Tianming Liu, an associate professor of computer science, is also working to observe brain activity in patients with MCI along with the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and Duke University in a $1.3 million grant from the National Institutes of Health.Liu’s project will further refine and improve upon a map of the human brain developed by his team called the dense individualized and common connectivity-based cortical landmarks, or DICCCOL, map. He said he and his collaborators realized there was a gap in a previous major study of dementia patients who were not examined by both fMRI and diffusion tensor imaging and that this study would help fill that gap.“My collaborators at UNC Chapel Hill and Duke and I discussed the potential of doing a small population at Duke, for example we try 15 health controls and 15 MCIs, with the same diagnostic criteria as the [Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative] two project and we will acquire a complete data in the Duke population including diffusion tensor imaging and fMRI,” he said.He said working with Duke Medical Center will allow the research team to create a brain map specific to the age range when patients typically develop early signs of dementia.


 


“Each population is different. For example, currently our DICCCOL system was developed for healthy adults from 20 to 30 years in age range, so we will tailor or refine this map towards the elderly populations including both health controls and MCI populations,” he said. “We don’t know how much difference we can see yet, but my feeling is that there could be some subtle differences and we want our template or our standard space [to be able to determine that].”Xi Jiang, a fourth-year doctoral student of computer science, said the three-way collaboration allows the team to look at the human brain from many different perspectives.“The human brain is very complicated,” he said. “We can do analysis maybe from the [behavioral sciences] — that’s from a different perspective so we also collaborate with them — but from our [computer science] perspective, we want to use the computational methods to uncover the mystery of the brain. That’s why I’m so interested in this field.”But Liu said each patient suffering from MCI will be different, so not all the brain scans will be identical. Though researchers are hoping to find a characterizing difference between elderly patients’ brains with and without that early potential sign of dementia.","Jeanette Kazmierczak

22-Jan-14,Great Sexpectations: Taking the relationship search online,"We’ve all seen ads boasting the effectiveness and success of online dating sites. And for good reason. Online dating has become a very lucrative business, with sites like Match.com spanning five continents and 25 countries. Yet, while international hordes of the lonely flock to the Internet to find a significant other, how well do such sites really work?One of my best friends met a boy online when through an online chat room when we were in high school. For over a year they e-mailed, “Skyped” and Facebook messaged — they basically used all means of online communication a virtual relationship could make use of. But, at the end of the day, he lived in Europe and she lived here. A year and six months in, he bought a plane ticket. The very evening he landed, I got a text from her asking if I was available to Skype. Naturally, I found it very strange that a couple parted for so long would want to be interrupted by video chats with a hometown friend. Wanting to give them time to themselves, I turned her request down.


 


The next day, she called me. A trip that was supposed to result in a getting to know each other was cut short — a mere 24 hours together. The reason? There was no in-person chemistry, at least on her part. The attraction merely did not exist face-to-face. Suddenly, all the feelings of the past year and a half dissipated. Perhaps this is an extreme outcome, but it does make one doubt the effectiveness of meeting a soul mate online. Granted, most online matches plan to rendezvous more quickly than my friend and her European man (that would come to be known for giving her the most slobbery kisses she ever received) did. In the end, he ended up moving his flight up a day. He stayed the night in a hotel room and they ended all contact there. If anything is to be learned from this story, it is that sometimes the most compatible people on paper (or on a computer screen) just do not work out in practice. Go forth, meet your interests however you like, but take care not to become attached before meeting them in person. —Andreea Popa is a junior from Snellville majoring in psychology",Andreea Popa,views,https://www.redandblack.com/views/great-sexpectations-taking-the-relationship-search-online/article_fa1e9ac6-838b-11e3-b1fd-001a4bcf6878.html
22-Jan-14,Sustainability grants help fund student projects,"Nine student groups received a total of $28,000 from the University of Georgia’s Office of Sustainability to complete projects promoting a culture of sustainability on campus.Kevin Kirsche, director of sustainability, said students submitted a total of 33 proposals this year. The projects range from outdoor solar power charging stations to a composting initiative and bike repair stations.“Being involved in the community really makes me feel like I’m being productive and that it could potentially be important, and I really saw a need for this kind of project,” said Keri Lydon, a doctoral student in the department of environmental health science, of her water-quality monitoring project.


 


Lydon’s grant will pay for Environmental Protection Agency level tests of the water quality of Tanyard Creek.Sarah Jones, a senior anthropology major, will be using her grant money to establish small circular gardens with an inner compost pile to teach people about sustainable ways to grow their food.“Athens is a place of extreme class distinction and poverty in some areas, and it’s really hard to get access to healthy food. There are a lot of food deserts,” Jones said. “I want the key hole gardens to be a part of creating food for the community and giving the community ideas of ways to create their own food.”Brian Holcombe, Elizabeth Crute and Katie Dean are designing solar charging stations they hope to see installed around campus so students can power up their electronics while on the go.“Coming from an engineering perspective, I’ve always known that you have to interact with people and I think some engineers are very withdrawn and they don’t like to communicate with the public about what they’re designing,” said Crute, a senior environmental engineering major from Augusta. “I don’t think that I’m on that end of the spectrum. However, I think the type of questions [Brian] came up with and how [he] went about getting responses from people was very interesting.”While the nine projects did have a wide range of diversity, three centered around promoting the bike culture on campus and in the community.Sahana Srivatsan, a junior international affairs major and an intern for the Office of Sustainability, will use her grant to expand the office’s UGA Bulldog Bikes program, which rents bikes as part as a cooperative initiative.“I really love biking and that’s why I applied for the internship and in turn the grant,” she said. “I always love biking around campus. I’m not like a racer or anything like that but I really enjoy it as a method of transportation.”


 


Joey Robinson, a graduate student in the Warnell School of Forestry and Natural Resources, will be expanding on a project started by the Outdoor Recreation Center, which will place bicycle repair stations across campus.“[We want] to make people feel more comfortable to ride their bikes on campus and let them know if something happened they’d be able to take care of it and not be stranded,” he said.Kirsche said that three projects out of nine centered on cycling was reflective of a movement in the community.“It’s exciting to see that campus bike culture [continues] to blossom,” he said. “And of course it supports our goal of fewer cars on campus and more people biking conveniently and safely across campus.”","Jeanette Kazmierczak

28-Jan-14,Scouting report: Dominick Sanders,"Three-star athlete Dominick Sanders became the University of Georgia’s 18th commitment for the class of 2014.He was the first commitment picked up under new defensive coordinator Jeremy Pruitt Monday night after having his scholarship offer pulled from the University of Central Florida.Hailing from Tucker High School, the offensive weapon, defensive menace and special teams ace will prospectively join fellow three-star recruit and high school teammate Detric Dukes as a Bulldog. Quick and versatile, Sanders is a big-play threat in all three phases of the game. However, his greatest asset is also his greatest liability, as his style of play will need to be altered to succeed in the college game.


 


Strengths:The word versatile does not do Sanders justice. In his senior year at Tucker alone, Sanders lined up as a safety, a wide receiver, a running back, a punt returner and even as a quarterback, both from the shotgun and under center. Sanders’ exact size varies greatly depending on the source, but he slots in somewhere between 5-foot-11 and 6-foot-1, the perfect range for a player of any of his prospective positions. Sanders is great at improvising, capable of making quick cuts and becoming an elusive open-field threat. Always willing to showcase his athleticism, Sanders accelerates extremely well, both bursting through holes on offense and closing in on ball carriers on defense. Offensively, Sanders profiles as a one-cut back with tremendous field awareness and a considerable amount of leg drive in addition to being a talented slot wide receiver with knack for high pointing the ball in midair. Defensively, Sanders profiles as a cover safety with outstanding open-field ability and above-average attacking ability. But perhaps Sanders shines most as a special teams player. As a punt returner, Sanders uses his acceleration to create holes and his field vision to find ones that aren’t yet there.Weaknesses:For all the improvising that Sanders does, he creates opportunities for himself to be decimated as a college player. Often reversing his field before he even reaches the line of scrimmage, Sanders’ athleticism will be average in the Southeastern Conference — his 4.83 second 40-yard dash time is far from the best on the field among skill position players. If he attempts to play in college as he did in high school, he will likely either be corralled or fall victim to injury. Sanders too often leaves his feet while running, making him especially susceptible to form tackles, airborne tacklers and leg injuries resulting from off-balance hits. Defensively, he needs to develop more as a tackler to be considered starting material at any point in his career. He relies on his arms and his natural strength too much when hitting ball carriers and sometimes even seems hesitant to hit, allowing the offensive player to come to him.Final Take:Sanders is a good get for the Bulldogs before National Signing Day. Though all the positions he profiles at have already been filled in this recruiting cycle, Sanders creates well-needed hypothetical depth at a wide array of positions. While the safety position has already been filled by three-star Kendall Gant, the running back position has been filled by four-stars Sony Michel and Nick Chubb and the wide receiver position has been filled by four-star Shakenneth Williams and three-star Gilbert Johnson, Sanders’ versatility allows him to compete with any of these prospects.Sanders’ play in the open field compares well to that of former NFL star Dante Hall and to Cincinnati Bengals cornerback Adam Jones, but his best comparison sits on UGA’s active roster. Sanders is very similar to rising sophomore running back J.J. Green. Strong enough to play defense but too elusive not to use in some respect in the offensive game, Sanders can play any skill position naturally and match up against most athletes defensively. Though a redshirt season is possible, Sanders may well be the most versatile recruit committed to the Bulldogs this season.",Nick Suss,sports,https://www.redandblack.com/sports/scouting-report-dominick-sanders/article_b687b536-87e1-11e3-9e91-001a4bcf6878.html

30-Jan-14,Prior knowledge helps Georgia Center instructors prep students for grad exam,"The thoughts of post-graduation life can be seen in the furrowed brows of University of Georgia students carrying study materials in preparation for graduate exams: the Graduate Record Exam, the Law School Admission Test, the Graduate Management Admission Test and the Medical College Admission Test.The UGA Center for Continuing Education offers prep courses for these tests to help ease students' anxieties. The instructors are referred by Educational Testing Consultants, a company that “specializes in providing test preparation services to college and university outreach.”The Georgia Center vets chooses from those provided.


 


“We can’t all be subject matter experts,” said Mary Garrison, an administrator with the courses at the Georgia Center.Garrison said the GRE and LSAT usually receive more enrollment than the GMAT. The MCAT, however, doesn’t have a prep course at the Georgia Center.Steven Harris, the director for curriculum development for these courses, said there wasn’t much incentive for the Georgia Center to join the market of MCAT courses.“The parts of the test that don’t require lots of knowledge of biology and chemistry in particular, and psychology and sociology now, are vanishingly small, so you need a deep content bench of experts for those tests,” Harris said.Garrison said MCAT classes were offered in the past, but there has been a lack of interest. She sends students inquiring about the MCAT course to a partner company.Changes in the Tests and Prep CoursesHarris said the LSAT has remained the most consistent in terms of content at the Georgia Center.“That test has remained remarkably stable over the past twenty years in fact,” Harris said, noting the only change made in the past included adding a pair of passages with questions instead of a single passage to the reading comprehension section of the test.


 


The GRE, however, is the opposite.“The GRE has been bouncing back and forth all over the place over the past few years,” Harris said.Harris said the GRE, when first moving to computer, didn’t have a format that allowed for students to go back and change answers.For both the GMAT and GRE, Harris said he has seen more emphasis in critical thinking skills. There are questions that ask for students to identify all possible true answers. These changes to the GMAT and GRE, Harris said, came about in the summer and fall of 2012. As the testing dates for the GRE become more frequent, he said, a larger bank of public test questions will become available, allowing for the Georgia Center to update its curriculum.For Duncan Elkins, the changes haven’t affected how he approaches the math section of the GRE but have the verbal section.“I’ve always demonstrated how to do the [math] problem all the way as if it were a conventional fill-in-the-blank question and then stepped backwards through the solution to demonstrate where you could be sure enough which choice was the correct answer,” he wrote in an email. “On the verbal section, the changes have let me de-emphasize building vocabulary in class, because the test no longer contains analogy and antonym questions that require the test-taker to know relatively precise definitions.”For the LSAT, Elkins said the splitting of the reading comprehension passages hasn’t changed his approach at all.“It may have led them to emphasize slightly different skills in the questions associated with that passage, but there were occasional passages from before the switch that lent themselves to the same sort of ‘compare and contrast’ questions that show up with these paired passages, now,” Elkins wrote, “so all the new format does is let us count on that style appearing every time.”

The Prep CoursesCourses offered are available in face-to-face and online formats. Face-to-face classes are kept deliberately small, approximately 12 students for each course.“Our instructors do not work from a script,” Garrison said. “They work from a knowledge of the test. That also enables them to zero in on each student’s special need.”Garrison said the Georgia Center cannot guarantee a score increase, something competitors like Kaplan, Inc. does provide, due to the human factors involved in the test-taking process. That aside, the Georgia Center allows you to get your money’s worth.“If you don’t do as well on the test as you feel you should have based on the instruction that we gave you, the instruction you paid for, we allow you to take that course again at just a $60 administrative fee,” he said.",Stephen Mays @stephen_mays,uganews,https://www.redandblack.com/uganews/campus/prior-knowledge-helps-georgia-center-instructors-prep-students-for-grad/article_0c34e034-8928-11e3-9bec-001a4bcf6878.html
30-Jan-14,UGA women’s tennis to appear on College MatchDay this spring,"College GameDay has become a phenomena when it comes to delivering top college football and basketball games. Now, College MatchDay will attempt to do the same for college tennis. The weekly series will spotlight 22 matches on 18 campuses, including 10 that will live on ESPN3.College MatchDay will come to Athens to showcase the women’s tennis match against Missouri March 30. The match will stream live on ESPN3 along with a fan experience trailer. The matches will have a different format than the ones that are typically played for regular competition.Instead of playing three doubles matches first and six singles matches second, the NCAA Division I athletic directors proposed that the six singles matches will be played first. When the first team wins four matches and captures the match, the remaining matches will be called off. In case of a 3-3 tie after singles, a 10-point super tiebreaker will be implemented for the three doubles matches to determine the winner. A team will need two doubles wins to win the overall team match.

1-Feb-14,Georgia women's tennis shuts out Clemson,"The fourth-ranked Georgia Bulldogs hosted the No. 13 Clemson Tigers Saturday at the Lindsey Hopkins Indoors Courts. Match play started at noon and ended with the Bulldogs sweeping the Tigers 7-0. After winning the doubles point, Georgia carried the same energy into singles play.The lineup for doubles was Beatrice Gumulya and Jessy Rompies of Clemson against the No. 5 team of junior Lauren Herring and senior Maho Kowase in the first slot. Yana Koroleva and Tristen Dewar played Georgia’s senior Kate Fuller and sophomore Silvia Garcia in the second spot. The last spot was occupied by Clemson’s Joana Eidukonyte and Romy Koelzer and Georgia’s Carline Brinson and Lilly Kimbell. Georgia got the doubles point after 6-3 and 6-4 wins by Herring and Kowase and Brinson and Kimbell, respectively. Fuller and Garcia’s match was suspended at 5-1. Doubles play took 35 minutes.“They came out with great energy,” head coach Jeff Wallace said. “We did great in doubles. In the critical junctures in the doubles, they lifted their games up and executed phenomenal shots to get us the doubles point.”


 


The singles lineup was Koroleva against the fourth-ranked Herring in the first spot. No. 51 Koelzer played No. 10 Garcia. No. 44 Gumulya competed against No. 25 Kowase in the third spot. No. 103 Dewar battled against No. 33 Kimbell. In the fifth spot was Ani Miao against Fuller. Rompies and Mia King rounded out the sixth spot.Herring dismissed Koroleva first, beating her 6-1, 6-2.“In singles, we got off to a really good start except for Lilly, who then came back and had a really great day winning that match,” Wallace said. “And Lauren who had lost to that player last year was able to get revenge and beat her in a match that was really one sided.”Kimbell fell early in her match. Dewar won the first set 6-1, before Kimbell came back to win the second set 6-2. Dewar could not redeem herself in the third set super tiebreaker as Kimbell won it 10-4. Kimbell was the second to finish.“I think she came out playing really well, and I wasn’t making my shots,” Kimbell said. “Fortunately, I had the crowd behind me and in the second set I started putting more balls in play. I started coming in a lot more, and that allowed her to miss. It was a rough first set, but I think after I got it together I was able to pull of the match.”The crowd was a factor for the team. The players felt the support from the stands on the courts as they played.“Winning the second set definitely upped my confidence a lot going into the tie breaker,” Kimbell said. “Every point I won, the crowd was just going nuts, so that was great.”Garcia finished her match third, defeating Koezler 6-3, 6-3. Kowase was the fourth player to win. She topped Gumulya 6-2, 6-3. Georgia was up 5-0 going into its last two singles matches.


 


King was victorious against Rompies 6-2, 6-2, while Fuller defeated Miao 6-2, 7-5 and secured the 7-0 victory for the team.“I didn’t really know anything about my opponent,” King said. “But I knew Clemson was going to come out fighting and I was really motivated from watching the girls play before me. I was just going for it, swinging free, and everything worked out really well.”Wallace was proud of how his team executed what they’ve been working on in practice.“As each person came onto the court, they did the things we’ve been working on,” Wallace said. “I thought we did a lot of great things today and the result was a 7-0 win.”The team has gotten off to a great start to its spring season. It won against Arkansas, Elon, and had top finishes in Hawaii. The squad attributes its success to great team chemistry and belief in itself.“It’s been great,” King said. “We have the same team plus [freshman] Caroline [Brinson]. We have such great chemistry which makes playing so much easier.”The wins have the team confident about its chances against any opponent.“I think we really believe in ourselves and believe in each other,” Kimbell said. “We believe we can beat anyone in the country. Having Clemson come in being a great team, and having swept them is great.”

5-Feb-14,Republican political candidates show disapproval of liberal leadership,"Mike Collins said a person who understands business is crucial for the government right now, and his 20 years of owning a trucking company puts him ahead of his competitors.University of Georgia students saw the possible future of Georgia politics at the UGA College Republicans meeting in the Zell B. Miller Learning Center Wednesday.To an audience of about 60 students and faculty, three guest speakers including Collins, the 10th district congressional Republican candidate, spoke about the problems they believe exist in the United States government because of liberal leadership.


 


“We need people who understand business,” said Collins whose father, Mac Collins is a former congressman in the 8th district of Georgia. “It’s one thing to talk about issues — it’s another thing to experience those issues. I know what it takes to create that atmosphere where you have that drive to succeed.”Collins said an issue he wanted to focus on in his campaign was job creation. He said it is important not only to create jobs but also to create a job atmosphere with low taxation.“I have an individual responsibility here,"" he said. ""I’d love to have your help.""Eugene Yu, who is running to represent Georgia in the Senate, also spoke, starting out with a story he believes epitomizes the American dream.Yu moved from South Korea to the U.S. when he was only a teenager, and more than 40 years later, he is running for a Senate position.“I am proof this dream is real,” said Yu, who also served as a military policeman after enlisting in the U.S. Army. “We live in a great nation. We may all look different, but we all have a lot to be grateful for. Our diversity is strength for America.”Yu said the same American dream he upholds in his success is slipping away. Blaming the Affordable Care Act and over borrowing as main issues for this situation, Yu said he believes his five point plan for health care on his website could be the answer to keeping the American dream alive.“Ladies and gentlemen, you must wake up,” he said. “Our nation is in crisis. When I get elected I’m going to do whatever I need to do.”


 


When Yu was done speaking, he had a surprise for the audience, which included bright blue T-shirts with the phrase “Washington Needs a U-turn” on them.Ken Beall, the principle of Beall & Company, discussed his own struggles of managing a small business during the recession. He said although he did not have to lay off his employees, he had to become an independent contractor — only able to pay his employees when he could find work.“I want to apologize for what [U.S. President Barack Obama] has done to you,” Beall said. “He left young people with the huge burden to redistribute the wealth.”Freshman John Pilcher of Warner Robins said he enjoyed learning about the candidates and their strong beliefs on certain policies.“I was surprised how strongly they opposed current government and everything that’s wrong with it now,” said the biological science major. “It’s interesting how their beliefs coincided. My parents are both Republicans, and I think I’m leaning that way too.”",Rachel Brannon @rachbran18,uganews,https://www.redandblack.com/uganews/politics/republican-political-candidates-show-disapproval-of-liberal-leadership/article_06d33536-8ec4-11e3-8e1f-001a4bcf6878.html
5-Feb-14,Storify: New signees welcomed into Bulldog family,"The Georgia football team has had a busy morning on National Signing Day as 19 commits have already signed letters of intent to play for the Bulldogs next season.Most of the signees were expected, but the Bulldogs received a letter of intent from four-star wide receiver Isaiah McKenzie who was originally thought to be going to either Virginia Tech, Ole Miss or Florida.The other surprising commitment came from three-star tight end Hunter Atkinson who was all but committed to Cincinnati. The Bulldogs will keep checking the fax machine for more commitments as the day goes on, and wait to hear from their No. 1 target Lorenzo Carter, who will announce his decision at 3:40 p.m. from Norcross High School. Check back for updates on his decision.

5-Feb-14,Tight end Hunter Atkinson signs with the Bulldogs,"The University of Georgia has brought in another surprise recruit on National Signing Day in the form of three-star tight end Hunter Atkinson from West Hall High School in Oakwood, Ga. A big tight end at 6-foot-5, his length as a pass catcher is considered his greatest asset.Atkinson had not been connected to UGA before Wednesday as he was previously expected to sign with Cincinnati, a school he had unofficially committed to.Named the Georgia Sportswriters Association’s tight end of the year for Class AAA football, Atkinson’s announcement came into UGA just before 10:30 a.m.


 


Scouting reportNobody saw three-star tight end Hunter Atkinson landing at Georgia.250-pound pass-catching tight end had a verbal commitment to Cincinnati before sending in his letter of intent to Georgia on National Signing Day.Atkinson was the Bulldogs’ 17th recruit to officially sign with the team on Signing Day. He joins Jeb Blazevich as the only tight ends expected to join Georgia’s class of 2014.Strengths: Atkinson is the epitome of a versatile tight end. At West Hall High school he lined up as a traditional receiver, a tight end on the line of scrimmage, and a fullback out of the backfield. Atkinsons’ biggest assets are his hands. He lines up most as a true receiver, which allows him to take advantage of his big frame. His hands are reliable and most defensive backs and linebackers are a mismatch. His size would also allow him to play offensive line at the next level if that was the route Georgia chooses to take with Atkinson.Weaknesses: His size also poses some issues that he’ll have to control playing against college players. His route running could use some sharpening and his blocking form is raw. At the next level, he won’t be able to manhandle linebackers like he could in high school. While his receiving is well defined already, that blocking will be his biggest adjustment.Final Take: Atkinson is a pleasant surprise for the Georgia depth chart. With the loss of senior tight end Arthur Lynch, Atkinson has an opportunity to make an immediate contribution to the team. He projects best as a pass catcher and Georgia would be well served to use him in that capacity as opposed to moving him to the offensive line.Atkinson’s frame and style of game matches well with Lynch, who was listed as 6-foot-5, 254 pounds before his senior season. He matches well with the arising NFL prototype of a tight end as a tall, strong pass catcher like the Saints’ Jimmy Graham or the Patriots’ Rob Gronkowski. Combined with the blocking Blazevich and rising junior Jay Rome, the Bulldogs are well rounded at the tight end position for 2014.

6-Feb-14,"Video stores, a sacred institution, must stay","The rise of online video streaming websites and grocery store kiosks has suffocated the once-thriving industry of rental chains, such as Blockbuster and Movie Gallery. Movie streaming sources provide a sadly limited selection of popular films, but the industry has successfully snuffed out big business while also providing room for local businesses to thrive.Despite the popularity of online streaming, video stores remain an integral institution for an artistic subculture of cinephiles that should be protected.Vision Video, an Athens institution for around 30 years, has proven that there is a greater culture to be involved with than the mundane scrolling and streaming afforded by Netflix and Amazon Prime. 


 


The store has become an important local landmark that provides genuine interaction and communication within a society limited by the fall of bigger chains.“There is no real community on the Internet except for a sort of abstract communication that will eventually have a major backlash in society,” Michael Walraven, the general manager of Vision Video’s Barnett Shoals Road location, said. Walraven and his assistant manager, Zach Henderson, stressed the importance of community involvement, as well as giving back to the community in order to sustain a culture of movie-lovers that has been lost in many American cities.“When you bring $5 to Vision Video, it goes straight into the community,” Walraven said. “If I spend $5 at a Redbox, I don’t know where it goes.”According to Walraven, the store has somewhere between 36,000-40,000 titles on its shelves, whereas Redbox may have around 50 titles at any given time. Beyond the sheer magnitude of available titles, Vision Video stocks an expansive selection of classic, independent and foreign films — something that Netflix and Redbox glaringly lack. “If you were to walk in and ask for a movie we didn’t have, we’d at the very least jot it down and try to find it for you,” Henderson said, directing my attention to a handwritten list of titles affixed to the wall. They pride themselves on the personal attention and customer satisfaction that simply doesn’t exist online.Although the threat of more convenient streaming technology has become all too real for franchises such as Blockbuster, the limited opportunity for customer interaction and cultural sustainability has made small businesses like Vision Video important and extremely relevant. 


 


Consumers searching for anything from one of the many films not available for streaming to a culture of like-minded locally-oriented  individuals only have the opportunity to find it among the shelves of their local video store.—Adrienne Andrews is a sophomore from Hinesville majoring pre-journalism",Adrienne Andrews,views,https://www.redandblack.com/views/video-stores-a-sacred-institution-must-stay/article_94b050c8-8f4b-11e3-998e-001a4bcf6878.html
7-Feb-14,Change of heart for Georgia offensive tackle Mark Beard,"After less than 24 hours to think about it, senior offensive tackle Mark Beard has asked to rejoin the Bulldog football team.Beard planned to graduate from UGA in the spring and transfer to another university for his final year of eligibility, which a new NCAA rule would allow without penalty.Beard made the decision to transfer Thursday evening after playing in 28 games and starting twice for the Bulldogs.


 


""Sometimes making a decision and living it out are two different things,"" head coach Mark Richt said in a press release. ""As I've mentioned before the same thing happened to me. As a player I told my coach I had decided to leave for what I thought were all the right reasons. But after a few days, I realized it was a bad decision and asked to come back. He took me back and I'm happy Mark will still be part of our program.""Beard joined the Bulldogs two years ago after transferring from Coffeyville, Kan., Community College.",Tanya Sichynsky,sports,https://www.redandblack.com/sports/change-of-heart-for-georgia-offensive-tackle-mark-beard/article_fe948044-9000-11e3-972d-0017a43b2370.html
11-Feb-14,"Obama declares Georgia in state of emergency, trucks possibly diverted through Athens","The government's reaction to the weather conditions this week can be contrasted drastically to that of the snow storm in the last week of January.President Barack Obama signed a Georgia State of Emergency Declaration Tuesday, which will send relief efforts across the state.This declaration will authorize the U.S. Department of Homeland Security’s Federal Emergency Management Agency — FEMA — to coordinate efforts, minimize the threat of catastrophe and provide the “appropriate assistance for required safety” in 45 counties including Athens-Clarke County, according to a FEMA news release.


 


Public officials across the state promised changes to safety response plans after a couple of inches of snow catastrophically shut down Atlanta two weeks ago.Here is one of the changes: Send the semis to Athens.Commercial trucks traveling in Atlanta could possibly be re-routed from Interstate 85 to highway US 441, which travels through Athens, as part of the state’s contingency plans for an ice storm which started Monday night and is expected to rage through Wednesday.Jeff Montgomery, a public information officer for ACC, said the state had not made the call to start sending trucks through Athens yet, but that it was being reserved as a possibility.“The plan is in place for them to use that route,” Montgomery said. “However, the state would make that decision if it was necessary to close I-285.”In response, the ACC Police Department released three rules for trucks coming through town:
Stay in the right lane at all times on all roadways.
Use only the outer loop of the GA 10 Loop (Athens Perimeter) to circumvent the core of Athens.
Do not enter the Perimeter except to make deliveries.
These restrictions are in effect for all trucks, not only those coming from Atlanta. Montgomery said he expects the rules to remain in place at least until Thursday.


 


A Georgia Department of Transportation release at noon Tuesday provided an update to the conditions.“We are starting to get reports of icing on bridges so please slow down, give yourself plenty of space between you and the vehicle in front of you and use lower gears on your vehicle for additional traction,” said Bayne Smith, district engineer for northeast Georgia, in the release. “We ask you to please stay home and not drive unless it is an emergency.”The National Weather Service predicted “catastrophic” ice totals from Tuesday to Thursday, forecasting a third to three quarters an inch of ice on roads from Atlanta eastward along I-85. Gov. Nathan Deal upgraded 43 counties to a state of emergency Tuesday morning after announcing 45 previously.ACC was among yesterday’s announcements.“We’ve included health officials and power companies in our preparations because heavy downfalls of ice can knock out power supply,” Deal said in a release as his administration prepared for the storm this weekend. “I want to make sure we’re reaching out to health care facilities so they can have backup plans in place.”Authorities expect “a significant increase in commercial truck traffic” throughout the area and will also provide message boards at key positions. Montgomery said there had been no reports of heavy ice or major traffic accidents as of 12:45 p.m. Tuesday.The University of Georgia and area schools cancelled class for Tuesday and ACC schools have cancelled classes for Wednesday, keeping most people home. Georgia Power ramped up its presence but only reported two power outages as of press time.",Nicholas Fouriezos @nick4iezos,uganews,https://www.redandblack.com/uganews/athens/obama-declares-georgia-in-state-of-emergency-trucks-possibly-diverted/article_1d7a8de6-9349-11e3-9400-0017a43b2370.html

20-Feb-14,Building Foundations: College of Engineering grows into competition for Georgia Tech,"Correction appendedIt’s the work of the students that makes the College of Engineering at the University of Georgia competitive.Senior Eric Refour has a job offer from Ford Motor Company, and the College of Engineering will be able to call Refour one of its own.


 


In an email to The Red & Black, Scott Williams, the executive director of the UGA Career Center, said the most recent graduate survey found 70 percent of the college’s respondents said they had a job secured after graduation. This is comparable to Georgia Tech’s Center for Career Discovery and Development’s exit survey, which said 70 percent of its respondents said they also had a job, said Andrea Comsa, the interim director for the Center for Career Discovery and Development.Refour had his choice of schools to transfer to after he changed his major to engineering. But he chose to stay at UGA because of the opportunities.“Originally my plan was just do a year and a half year and transfer over [to Tech] but, I don’t know, I was blessed with numerous opportunities here,” Refour said.The computer systems engineering major from Decatur is a student ambassador for the college. He said the ambassadors are doing their part to help promote the engineering program.“Every week we have different students coming in from all over the Southeast and we even have some coming from different parts of the country just to tour and figure out what we have to offer as far as engineering majors,” Refour said. “So I feel like we are doing a great job as far as reaching out.”Don Leo, dean of the College of Engineering and Mickey Montevideo, the public relations coordinator, agreed that student organizations play their own role in promoting and growing the school by going to national conventions. The school has 14 student organizations.Each of the college's eight undergraduate degrees, Leo said, has a student chapter of its professional organization, such as American Society of Civil Engineers and Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers.These organizations, Refour said, promote involvement in the college.


 


“Our student clubs here are actually doing a really good job as far as making a name for themselves and attracting students to come and participate with the college of engineering and see what we have to offer,” he said.• • •After offering classes in 2012, UGA’s College of Engineering is paving the path to become a more prominent school of its kind, allowing UGA’s engineering students to compete with other engineering students including those at Georgia Tech.Leo said students need to be ready for life after college, and the engineering college works to make meaningful relationships with businesses to help secure future positions for all its graduates.“It’s making sure that that set of stakeholders, you know, companies that are going to hire our students and work with our faculty on research projects and work with our students on design projects, making sure they have awareness of our program and have a buy into our program,” he said.Leo said one of the initiatives the school takes to promote the school is going around the state and meeting with students, parents and businesses.“Mickey [Montevideo] and I and some others flew down to Savannah, for example, late last year, met with businesses down there, met with some alumni, met with some parents of current students,” Leo said. “Out of that came some partnerships where we’re talking about possibly working with some folks down there on an engineering academy in the Savannah area.”Having a good industrial advisory board, Leo said, also serves as a sort of promotion.

• • •Tom Jackson, the vice president for public affairs, said UGA has offered degrees in engineering for more than 100 years through the College of Agricultural and Environmental Sciences, and it’s a point of pride for UGA to have a separate school for engineering.“In a general sense, the University of Georgia for years had to explain why it had neither medicine nor engineering, which is really unusual for a flagship university.” Jackson said. “So it’s a real point of pride that we have developed this College of Engineering.”Leo said the college has about 1,000 students — about 400 more than last year.And after almost two years as a college, UGA’s engineering students are also competing with Georgia Tech in not only jobs but going to graduate school as well.Williams said 16 percent of UGA engineering students are going to attend graduate school after graduation, and Comsa said 24 percent of Georgia Tech students are going to graduate school.• • •People are taking notice of UGA’s significant growth in its engineering programs.

Montevideo said the school is getting the attention of parents of prospective students by holding different activities and competitions.“FIRST LEGO League is a state competition,” he said. “When we had the opportunity to host a portion of the state competition here at the University, we jumped all over it.”Montevideo said the college had 350 middle schoolers come to UGA for the competition. The other 32 teams competed at Georgia Tech.Leo said LEGO League teaches students about robotics and the design process.He said the competition gave 500 to 600 people a chance to look at the school and what it has to offer.Leo and his team are doing a lot to let prospective students know that UGA has an engineering program.

3-Mar-14,Managing sideline anger important to team's performance on the court,"The line between a constructive argument and a technical foul is a fine one.The image of Georgia men’s basketball coach Mark Fox shedding his jacket and striding out on the court to give referees his opinion is joked about at times.This tactic, however, has a very serious purpose.


 


“He’s battling for us,” sophomore guard Charles Mann said. “He gives all he has for us so in return, we want to play hard and lay everything out on the line for him and for the program.”In the wake of a controversial call in the Atlantic Cost Conference just over a week ago — which bounced now No. 4 Syracuse from the peak of the rankings and placed Florida at the top — Fox is careful not to step on any toes regarding the consistency of Southeastern Conference officiating.“I think the way the rules are written…you could almost make a case every play that it could go either way,” Fox said. “I would say for everyone, including officials, it’s been a major change and hard to get used to. It’s probably hard for them to be consistent.”Georgia’s head coach did recognize the practicality behind sticking up for his players.“You’re always going to stick up for your players,” Fox said. “There’s different ways to do it and I think all coaches have a sense of how short of a fuse they’re dealing with. It’s a big fuse to let pop; obviously it gives the team free points when you get T’d up.”Mann, who's most important team contribution can be driving in the lane and drawing fouls, said it takes instinct to know whether he is going to get the call he wants.If the defender is in position, that’s when his skills as a distributor come in.“If I have the feeling that the defender is already there and set, then I’m just going to pitch the ball out to the open player,” Mann said. “If I don’t feel like he’s set, I’m going to keep on driving and being aggressive and try to score.”


 


Mann said it takes poise to fight through a non-call scenario when he picks up a charge he thinks is debatable.“It goes either way; sometimes I get the foul when the defender was there and sometimes I probably won’t,” Mann said. “It’s just part of the game. I try to keep a next-play mentality, and not worry about the previous play.”Fox said getting caught up in the moment is sometimes a fault of his, and it takes his own players to quell his flares of rage.Fox’s lone technical this year came at home against LSU, when one of his more fiery players, junior Nemanja Djurisic, had to quell his temper.“Nemi had to calm me down,” Fox said jokingly. “I was fine to be honest with you. I appreciate their poise. Part of that was to get them to get them to stand up and be men too, but it's just part of the game.""Fox said he usually has a pretty good idea where the line is between a constructive argument and a technical foul.“I generally try to have good sense,” Fox said. “You’ve got to read [the referees’] emotions also.""Fox also ditched his blazer during an emotional game against Ole Miss, but he recognizes that his emotions aren’t what will win games.

“You’ve certainly got to stick up for your team, but the team also understands that you can’t stick up for them all the time,” Fox said. “You’ve got to worry about playing well and you can’t spend all day arguing.”Five wins after his technical against LSU, Georgia is 10-6 in conference play and in sole possession of third place in the SEC behind two ranked teams.Georgia’s tenth win came Tuesday night against Missouri when Mann led the team with 19 points, going 8-for-12 from the line.After Missouri, Mann made it clear that the improvement to his scoring is not a product of getting more lenient calls.It falls on him and his mentality.“I’ve been struggling scoring the ball and I’ve been letting that get to me,” Mann said. “[Against Missouri] I just wanted to forget about it a go out there and play my game to help my team win, and I did a great job of that.”",Taylor Denman,sports,https://www.redandblack.com/sports/managing-sideline-anger-important-to-team-s-performance-on-the/article_54fbe342-a2e3-11e3-ae87-001a4bcf6878.html
4-Mar-14,Reported thefts on campus are higher than last year,"The number of reports in 2014 is already more than double the amount reported at around this point of the last academic year.An Archnews email sent by the UGA Police Department on Feb. 18 said the department had received 40 reports of theft and burglary on campus so far in the year — a 52 percent increase from the same time for the previous year.Of the reported thefts, 14 were from cars, 17 were from rooms or offices and nine were in public areas.


 


Eleven of the car thefts were of valuables left in plain view. Five of them were from unlocked cars. Fifteen of the 17 thefts from offices or rooms involved unlocked rooms. All thefts from public areas involved items left unattended.But UGA Police Chief Jimmy Williamson said he has noticed reports of theft slowing down after arresting a number of people responsible for many of the thefts.“We’ve arrested a guy for breaking into cars, and we think we’re going to connect it to a number of car break ins,” Williamson said. “We are in the process of arresting a guy that was stealing bikes, and we’re pretty much sure he was doing most, if not all of our bike thefts.”Williamson said there are still people he calls “opportunists” will take the easy opportunities to steal when faced with the situation.“They are people that may not normally steal, but if they see something that’s really available, you know when there’s nothing to keep them from doing it, they may not normally steal, but in this situation they would,” Williamson said. “That’s why it’s imperative for each and everyone of us to do things to reduce our exposure.”Williamson said this means students should never leave items unattended on campus, to always conceal items left in a car and to always lock doors.“These things sound simple, but the one time you don’t, maybe that person comes by and sees it and says ‘oh, that’d be easy.’”Williamson said he thinks people who have found themselves in unfortunate circumstances may be the best people to help promote locking doors.


 


Leanna Miller, a freshman animal science major from Statesboro, had her backpack stolen from her car parked in the West Campus Deck last month. Even though all of her front doors were locked, the thief discovered that the back hatch was unlocked. The person entered and took her bag, which had a laptop, calculator and school books, together valued at $746.“I’m a freshman and nothing like this has ever happened to me,” Miller said. “I’m from a really small town. I was like, ‘this is crazy.’”Although the textbooks will be returned to Miller, her laptop will probably never be found, she said. The experience taught her an important lesson.“I never leave my doors unlocked anymore, in my car or my dorm, and I tell all of my friends to do the same,” she said.Another student, Patrick Ward had his backpack, which contained his laptop and other textbooks, stolen late last year when he left it at his fraternity house on Milledge Avenue overnight. The total value was $2,665. And when he came back the next morning, it was gone.“I felt defeated and there wasn’t much I could do,” said Ward, a sophomore advertising major from Tampa, Fla. “I felt pretty confident that it was gone.”Ward later had to go through the process of reporting his losses.“My mom had insurance, so I got 70 to 80 percent covered by insurance, but my mom had to go through the whole process of filing claims and filing a police report,” Ward said. “It was such a hassle.”

Ward said he went to a small private high school and used to never lock doors. But he said he admits UGA was somewhat of a “reality check.”“Now I lock my doors no matter what,” Ward said. “I don’t sketch out or anything about it, but it’s better to be safe than sorry.”",Rachel Brannon @rachbran18,cops,https://www.redandblack.com/cops/reported-thefts-on-campus-are-higher-than-last-year/article_71ca5ec2-a3e7-11e3-b950-001a4bcf6878.html
7-Mar-14,No. 2 Georgia equestrian outrides No. 5 New Mexico State on senior day,"The No. 2 Georgia equestrian team honored its 23 seniors Friday in grand fashion. In the team’s last regular season meet of the season, it grabbed a 17-3 victory against No. 5 New Mexico State. With the win, the team finishes the regular season 9-3, one win more than last season.The Bulldogs captured all four MOP honors for the day. Meg O’ Mara took the honor in Equitation Over Fences, Paige Stawicki garnered an MOP for her performance in Horsemanship, Kylee Arbuckle was recognized for her ride in Equitation on the Flat, and Lauren Tieche grabbed the honor in Reining.“What a spectacular day to honor our seniors,"" head coach Megan Boenig said. “They are a special class and it has been an honor to coach them. Taking home all four MOP’s, as well as the high scores, reflected the level of preparation our riders have been working toward. I saw some strong, confident rides today and I believe we are heading in the right direction for post season. It was also great to have Coach Richt share some inspirational words with the team this morning.”


 


The Bulldogs started the day with a 5-0 sweep in Equitation Over Fences. Arbuckle tallied the first point of the evening. Senior Olivia Dorey followed Arbuckle’s ride with an 82-76 performance. O’Mara’s 86-70 ride earned her the MOP for the event. Freshman Liza Finsness and senior Abby O’ Mara ended the event with two more winning rides, allowing the Bulldogs to take Equitation Over Fences 5-0.The team took Horsemanship 4-1 with winning rides coming from senior Anna Sasser, junior Sara Parr, sophomore Rachel Kolb, and Stawicki, who notched the MOP honor with her 77.5-74 victory. New Mexico State did post one point in the event, but it was not enough to keep the Bulldogs from increasing their lead.Equitation on the Flat was no different. Georgia cruised over NMSU by sweeping the event 5-0. Dorey registered the first point in the event for the Bulldogs. Meg O’Mara and Caitlyn Francis took the next two points for the Bulldogs. Arbuckle posted the high point of the event with her 92-75 victory and grabbed the MOP honor. Finsness closed out the event with her 85-59 win, giving Georgia the 14-1 lead going into Reining.Sophomore Caroline Blackshear and freshman Charley Thiel notched the first two points of Reining. Tieche’s 71.5 ride allowed her take the MOP honor in Reining. The Aggies grabbed two points in the event, but the Bulldogs proved to be the better team on the day, earning the 3-2 event victory and the 17-3 overall defeat of the Aggies.The Bulldogs’ next meet will be after spring break, on Friday, March 21.

17-Mar-14,Update: UGA Athletic Association listed as ‘victim’ in football player arrests,"Four Georgia football players were arrested and booked into Athens-Clarke County Jail Monday evening on multiple counts of misdemeanor theft by deception against the University of Georgia Athletic Association, police said.Sophomore safety Tray Matthews, redshirt sophomore defensive end Jonathan Taylor, junior outside linebacker James DeLoach and redshirt freshman wide receiver Uriah LeMay have all been released on bond following their arrests on the eve of Georgia's first spring football practice. On March 3, assistant athletic director Stephanie Ransom reported to police that 11 student tuition checks had been deposited or cashed twice since January, police said in a report.


 


Each check was in the amount of $71.50 for a “total loss” of $786.50, police said.“I'm aware of the situation and it will be handled in an appropriate way,” head coach Mark Richt said in a statement released Tuesday morning.Taylor was booked at 8:41 p.m., followed by LeMay at 8:56 p.m., Matthews at 9:06 p.m. and DeLoach at 9:22 p.m, according to the jail log.LeMay is facing four counts of theft by deception and was released on $6,000 bond. Matthews was charged with three counts and released on $4,500 bond and Taylor and DeLoach both posted bond set at $3,000 after each were charged with two counts of the same, according to the jail log.All four players participated in Georgia's first spring practice, however none were made available to the media.",Tanya Sichynsky,sports,https://www.redandblack.com/sports/update-uga-athletic-association-listed-as-victim-in-football-player/article_9b1696fa-ae47-11e3-a8d5-001a4bcf6878.html

A committee of the whole is when a legislative body acts a committee for the purpose of discussion or debate.“The committee of the whole voted to recommend [the policy’s] approval,” Millsaps said.While the committee voted to send the ban for approval, the policy will not go into effect until the board approves it.",Brittini Ray @brittini_ray,uganews,https://www.redandblack.com/uganews/administration/smoking-ban-recommended-by-board-of-regents-committee-vote-set/article_ab8a46bc-aed8-11e3-9faf-0017a43b2370.html
18-Mar-14,UGA continue research of harmful chemicals with EPA grant,"The University of Georgia is one of four universities that will be a part of a $3 million grant from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to fund research to better understand how chemical interactions in the body may lead to altered brain development.Steven Stice, a professor in the animal and dairy science department at UGA, is the principal investigator for the grant. He said UGA is very excited at the opportunity this grant brings to conduct more research.“It’s so difficult to get these larger grants, so I was just really excited that we’re going to be able to make good progress in this area,” Stice said. “People don’t realize it, but they’re surrounded by chemicals, and they don’t know what [the chemicals] are doing or how they could be affecting them or pregnant women and their offspring in particular.”


 


Stice said this money will be distributed across different departments including animal dairy sciences, physics and environmental sciences to conduct research. As principal investigator, Stice will make sure departments receiving the grant have enough resources to use it properly.Stice said possibly the main reason UGA was picked for this grant was because its researchers from across the campus can team up.During the research they will do tests of compounds, such as human stem cells in a Petri dish instead of on animals, a method that takes a long time and is very expensive. When they do tests on animals, a study on one compound costs about $1.5 million and takes about two years to complete, Stice said.“We hope to do a study in a dish that can be completed within a week with hundreds of compounds, so we’ll be able to speed up the process and make it less expensive, and not have to use animals,” Stice said.He added that a common goal among researchers is to limit the amount of animals they use for studies.Also, Stice said animal studies have not been a good predictor of what happens in humans. It only works about half the time. Using human stem cells should be a better method for predicting human reactions, Stice said.When they start testing compounds, they are looking to find out what “initiating event” happens in the body when exposed to a chemical. The researchers can follow the effects of those chemicals on the ability of neurons to grow and develop in a petri dish, Stice said.Examples of chemicals in many households researchers have found to be harmful to humans are fire retardants found in couches, pesticides and Bisphenol A, which can be found in certain bottles, Stice said.


 


Stice said this grant could lead to future research with findings that could be surprising.“Initially, we are looking at [chemicals] that people think are potentially problematic to the developing brain,” Stice said. “When we start to go beyond this study, and branch out to all the other chemicals that are out there that we are exposed to, I think that’s when the real surprise will come about what is harmful to the developing brain.”",Rachel Brannon @rachbran18,uganews,https://www.redandblack.com/uganews/science_health/uga-continue-research-of-harmful-chemicals-with-epa-grant/article_82f3f8ac-ae0a-11e3-93f2-0017a43b2370.html
18-Mar-14,Football practice report: All players accounted for at first spring practice,"Georgia held its first practice of the spring football season on Tuesday. While the weather conditions were a little cold for spring, the team got its first chance to focus on football following Monday night’s arrests of four players.The media had access to two five-minute practice sessions. Here are some notes and observations from The Red & Black:· All four players that were arrested on Monday night, wide receiver Uriah LeMay, safety Tray Matthews, linebacker James DeLoach and defensive lineman Jon Taylor, were at practice and fully participated.


 


· Running back Keith Marshall, receiver Malcolm Mitchell, receiver Justin Scott-Wesley and tight end Jay Rome all wore green non-contact jerseys. Marshall, Mitchell and Scott-Wesley are all recovering from torn anterior cruciate ligaments, while Rome injured his foot late last season against Appalachian State. Running back Todd Gurley wore a red jersey and participated in all drills.· Defensive backs did a footwork drill in which they paired up and mirrored each other moving forward and backward across the field. “Plant and drive,” defensive coordinator Jeremy Pruitt yelled. Newly converted cornerback, sophomore J.J. Green, participated with the defensive backs. Pruitt commented on Green’s footwork on his second attempt at the drill, saying, “That’s better, J.J.”· After that the defensive backs paired off in groups of four. Each group of four had two members go at a time, shuffling side-to-side across the field while alternating pushing the pads of their partner. Angered at the group’s first attempt at the drill, Pruitt screamed at the defensive backs, “You put your hands on them like a damn man.”· While the quarterbacks paired with the tight ends to work short routes, running backs split off to do a drill in which they worked on staying low for a couple of yards before popping up and running.

19-Mar-14,Georgia track and field anticipates continued success into outdoor season,"Following a weekend that saw two national champions, a runner-up and seven All-America certificates at the NCAA indoor championships, the Georgia track & field team are preparing to transition to the outdoor season with the Alabama Relays meet this weekend.Over 30 teams including Georgia Tech, Cincinnati, Alabama and Illinois will make the trip in what is one of the biggest outdoor meets of the season. The turn of the season also marks the first time where strictly outdoor competitors like javelin throwers get to compete.""Looking ahead we really want to use the success of the indoor season as motivation for the outside season"" head coach Wayne Norton said ""We really just want to get our feet wet, get reacclimated with being outdoors, and building to scoring more points at the NCAA outdoor championships.""


 


After an indoor season that finished with the women's team taking third overall at indoor championships and the men's team placing 26th, the men will try to gain ground on their teammates season.""I think it's going to be interesting,"" freshman national champion Kendell Williams said. ""I think we motivated them and of course it will be friendly competition but I definitely want to see more guys and girls at outdoor championships.""Coming off of a record-breaking performance at the indoor championships, Williams as well as the other field event competitors, will have this week off to rest up before The Yellow Jacket Invitational on March 28th-29th. Among the team members set to compete this weekend are the sprinters and about half of the distance runners.Coach Norton will also be sending a group of throwers to compete in the Castillo Invitational in Tempe, AZ.""I'm really looking forward to the outdoor season because it allows us to get much better,"" Norton said. ""During the indoor season everything is more compact and it's in the heart of winter, moving outdoor the weather is much better, the energy is higher, and the openness puts us in a position to perform much better.""Norton is expecting a major leap during the outdoor season from his freshmen.""If you look at the last few meets of the indoor season, the times and marks they posted were progressively better from the beginning of the year,"" he said. ""Now that the outdoor season is here, they can focus on getting better and hopefully scoring points at the end of the year.""",Kennington Smith,sports,https://www.redandblack.com/sports/georgia-track-and-field-anticipates-continued-success-into-outdoor-season/article_3457ab4e-afc2-11e3-bb84-0017a43b2370.html
19-Mar-14,Georgia's safety position uncertain following arrest of Tray Matthews,"As the spring football season begins, Georgia’s situation at safety is anything but safe.After strong safety Josh Harvey-Clemons was dismissed from the team in mid February for a violation of team rules, the Bulldogs were relying on Tray Matthews to be the staple of its defensive backfield.Then Monday night came and Matthews found himself booked into an Athens-Clarke County jail for theft by deception along with three other teammates.


 


“You’re disappointed,” head coach Mark Richt said. “You’ve got to decide, start deciding what you’re going to do about it. At Georgia, we’ve never tried to hide things. If somebody makes a mistake then we clean it up, we don’t hide it.”With Tuesday morning came some answers as to exactly what the theft by deception entailed, but it left so many more questions related to on-the-field concerns. Will there be dismissals? Suspensions? How long before punishments are doled out?Richt was cryptic in his answers to all of these questions following the team’s first spring practice Tuesday. All four players were at practice Tuesday and fully participated, but Richt made it clear that this didn’t mean dismissals were off the table. At the same time, he also brought up in-house punishment and spoke mostly in generalities about the process he goes through when determining punishment.“These guys are not going to be perfect, I know that,” Richt said. “If they do something that needs discipline, we’re going to give it … If it causes a guy not to be at Georgia, then that’s what will happen. If it causes a guy to lose playing time, we’ll do that. If it calls some guy to have some other form of discipline internally but again, we’re always trying to, there’s going to be a form of punishment and some form of education and then … we’re going to love them.”Because of the public nature of the offenses, Richt would be hard-pressed to let the players go without suspension. If that’s the case, Georgia will have to look elsewhere for its starting safety against Clemson on Aug. 30.At Matthews’ position, free safety, the clear option would be rising sophomore Quincy Mauger. Mauger played in all 13 games last season and recorded seven starts due to assorted injuries to Matthews. The only other free safety listed on Georgia’s roster is senior Lucas Redd, a special teamer; although, it wouldn’t be out of the question to see him get some playing time, as Richt gave senior Connor Norman two starts last season.Standing next to him at strong safety should be senior Corey Moore, who played in 12 games and had seven starts last season. However, there are a couple of sources of variability in that plan.The first is redshirt freshman Tramel Terry. Terry redshirted last season after tearing his ACL in the Shrine Bowl All-Star game less than a month before he was set to begin classes at Georgia as an early enrollee. Originally a wide receiver, Georgia decided to move him to the safety position leading up to the Gator Bowl.


 


Now Terry is getting all of his snaps with the defense, but has yet to be designated as a free safety or a strong safety. Richt said he didn’t know exactly what he and new defensive coordinator Jeremy Pruitt planned to do with Terry.“Part of this process early on … is just trying to figure out who can do what,” Richt said. “I think that’s true of some of these other positions, especially guys that are crossing over from offense to defense [like] Tramel Terry … and then J.J. Green.”Terry’s 6-foot, 184-pound frame probably projects better to free safety than strong safety, which raises a second problem — Georgia’s star. Not in the sense of a defensive standout, but the “star” position, a hybrid between the third cornerback and an outside linebacker.Harvey-Clemons fit the star position perfectly with his combination of quick feet and size. The closest thing Georgia has to that on its roster now is Moore, but with the lack of depth at strong safety, Moore may not be expendable. Again, Richt said the star position was up in the air and would require more evaluation from himself and Pruitt.“I would just have to wait a little bit on that,” Richt said. “Tomorrow we’ll be watching all the film and I’ll be listening to what coach Pruitt has to say about that type of thing but right this minute I couldn’t give a good answer.”If Matthews and his cohorts are dealt with through an in-house punishment, these concerns become much less significant. Until Richt deems fit, nobody will know. Of the timetable on his decision, he ambiguously said, “Sometimes it happens rapidly and sometimes it doesn’t.“In due time everybody’s going to know what’s going happen because of it.” Richt said. “Some things, when it comes to discipline, are very public and some things aren’t. I’m not sure exactly where this is going to fall.”",Cody Pace,sports,https://www.redandblack.com/sports/georgia-s-safety-position-uncertain-following-arrest-of-tray-matthews/article_1c953f3c-afa7-11e3-92b8-001a4bcf6878.html
24-Mar-14,Georgia track and field starts off outdoor season on strong note,"After a strong beginning to its first outdoor track meet of the season, the Georgia track team ended on a similar note at the Alabama Relays as well as the Castillo Invitational.The men's 4X100 meter relay team sped their way to a victory on Saturday. Senior Johnathan Smith, Sophomore Jamario Calhoun, Freshmen Reggie Glover and Brandon Thompson finished with a time of 40.44 to win over 19 other teams.Calhoun also finished second in the long jump after the triple jump the day before, and he also finished with a personal best mark of 24 feet 6 ½ inches in the long jump. Fellow relay member Smith, took the 100M meter dash crown with a time of 10.25.


 


For the women, Sophomore Chanice Porter continued her winning ways from Friday with another victory on Saturday. After winning the 100 meter dash the day before, she took the long jump crown with a jump of 21-5.25, which leads the nation.Other Lady Bulldog sophomores had impressive performances as well. Myasia Jacobs finished third overall (second collegiate finisher) in the 100 meter dash with a time of 11.60 while Rashan Brown raced a personal best time of 53.67 to win the 400 meter dash. This puts her seventh all-time in the Lady Bulldog record books.On the final meet of the day, the Bulldogs made sure they finished strong. The men's 4X400 meter relay team of Maurice Freeman, Drew Branch,  Calhoun and Ayrian Evans raced to a time of 3:09.55 to finish second overall.Meanwhile across the country, Junior Nick Vena and Senior Caleb Whitener finished first and second in the men's shot put to lead the throwers in Tempe, AZ. Vena finished with a mark of 60-7.25 while Whitener threw 58-8.75.On the women's side, freshman Asianna Covington followed her record setting hammer throw on Friday to place finished in sixth place in the discus throw on Saturday. Her mark of 154-5 was good enough to place her at No. 8 on the all-time list.This upcoming week, the team will travel to Atlanta to compete in the Yellow Jackets Invitational on the March 28-29 where more team members are expected to compete. Head coach Wayne Norton is very excited about how the team performed this weekend and how they will progress moving forward.""Considering who we had competing at this meet, I would say it was one of the best second days of an outdoor opener that we've ever had,"" he said.

24-Mar-14,Recap: First week of spring practice in the books for Bulldogs,"New defensive coordinator Jeremy Pruitt likes to curse.During the first week of spring practice, that’s the first thing that stuck out; from anywhere on the practice field Pruitt’s screams can be heard and it’s clear that in order to play on his defense, Georgia players are going to have to leave that soft nature that characterized the defense last season behind.Pruitt worked almost solely with defensive backs during media-available sessions at practice, which is another good thing for the Georgia secondary because describing its performance last season as bad might be the understatement of the century.


 


However, the biggest change defensively is simplification. Head coach Mark Richt has spoken at length about how the scheme is being simplified, especially in its installation. While the defensive staff has a plan for how it will install the game plan, room for movement has been left in the schedule. Essentially, the staff wants to make sure the team understands what’s happening on day one before it goes on to day two.This first week also provided a glimpse at the players that are changing position. While J.J. Green, who moved from running back to corner, and Tramel Terry, who moved from receiver to safety, worked on getting acquainted with coach Pruitt in the secondary, Quayvon Hicks has started his transition from fullback to tight end (the ultimate goal is to have him play a hybrid position between the two).Richt has been impressed with Hicks’ hands and he’s bringing some size and blocking ability to the tight end position. In fact, his size was one of the biggest things that have stood out in week one. When Hicks walked out to speak with the media on Saturday, he looked more like a linebacker than a tight end — he’s massive.Then there’s Keith Marshall.Marshall is just about five months removed from a surgery to repair a torn ACL and, besides his green non-contact jersey, it’s hard to tell how he's faring. Marshall hasn’t participated in every drill and is not getting any competitive action, but he has shown some ability to crouch down and explode off of his knees. His rehab appears to be coming along nicely and even though he won't participate in the spring game, he should be a full-go once August rolls around.",Cody Pace,sports,https://www.redandblack.com/sports/recap-first-week-of-spring-practice-in-the-books-for/article_0336c06c-b379-11e3-a357-001a4bcf6878.html
27-Mar-14,Georgia equestrian senior class searches for first SEC championship,"This year’s senior equestrian class has a chance to be the first to have not won at least one Southeastern Conference championship in its four years at Georgia. They are determined to make sure that does not happen on March 28 in Blythewood, S.C.“There’s a lot more pressure to win, more so than in the past few years,” senior Abby O’Mara said. “It’s our last chance for the seniors because we have never won SEC’s, so we really want to end this year with winning SEC’s and nationals.”The No. 2 Bulldogs have won six-of-11 Sothern Equestrian championships since 2003. This season marked the first official season where the SEC sponsored equestrian as a sport, and the senior class wants to lift the trophy just like those who came before them.


 


The SEC tournament isn’t the tournament the team is focused on. It wants to win the National Collegiate Equestrian Association’s tournament as well. The riders believe SEC’s will serve as a confidence booster if they ride well, and of course, win.“We all want to put in good rides and feel confident,” O’Mara said. “Whatever the outcome is this weekend, we still have nationals. We just want to feel confident for nationals, and be solid in our rides. We want to feel like we are ready to win all of post season.”After an up-and-down year, the team came together in the second half of the season and fought to break into the top five national rankings again after slipping out before its midseason break. The drop out of the top five was a program first, but the team came back even stronger.The squad returned from Christmas break by winning its first three meets before losing to No. 1 South Carolina. Georgia finished the regular season by beating No. 4 Auburn and No. 5 New Mexico State. The last two wins allowed the team to move to No. 2 in the ranking and be the No. 2 seed going into the SEC tournament this weekend.“I think we are all feeling really good. We started to peak at the right time,” freshman Liza Finsness said. “We’ve had two weeks off, but it really hasn’t been two weeks off. We’ve been practicing and working to together to get pumped up for this. When we peaked, we got the confidence. It’s all really mental with this sport. We’ve just been building and building.”While some of the riders have been to the rodeo before, this will mark the first time the freshman will experience SEC tournament competition. Standout-freshman Finsness is optimistic, and that with the support of her teammates, she will do just fine.“I’m just really hoping to ride my best and focus,” Finsness said. “I know I have my entire team behind me and they want me to do well. I want to do it for them. It’s so different from before I came to school because now I want to ride for other people too.”Finsness has had multiple SEC Rider of the Week honors as well MOP honors. She capped off her season by being selected to First Team All-American in Equitation on the Flat and Second Team All-American in Equitation Over Fences. Sophomore Heather Schmidt, sophomore Rachel Kolb, senior McKenzie Lantz, senior Olivia Dorey and senior O’Mara were also recognized as All-American selectees.


 


Finsness was the only freshman selected from Georgia. Her hard work all season has contributed to the team’s success, but Finsness wants nothing more than to win the SEC tournament this week for her teammates. Finsness, like other underclassman, are getting guidance on what to expect from this weekend from the senior class.“They told me a lot about getting to know the different horses,” Finsness said. “How they are going to help will be by explaining to me how riding the different horses are, and just giving me tips and feedback that way. It’s very helpful because it has been in the past.”The team will face Auburn during the first round and will then be slated to play either South Carolina or Texas A&M. Georgia split its regular season series with South Carolina and Auburn, but won its series against Texas A&M outright. The win against South Carolina came in the exact place that the SEC tournament will be held this weekend.“Not too long ago we beat Auburn, and we beat South Carolina last semester, so we have to keep that in mind that if we are doubtful, we do have a chance of winning,” O’Mara said. “We all have to stay positive and remember that we are just as good as them, if not better.”The high hopes don’t stop with the players, but resonates with head coach Meghan Boenig as well. . She knows what the team is capable of doing in the ring, and believes her squad will keep performing like they have over that last three months.“I am expecting to see quality rides at the level we’ve been doing these last few weeks. We keep getting better each time,” Boenig said. “This is a very good team that really competes against itself and pushes itself, so I’m really excited for showing our stuff off Friday and Saturday, and bringing home the SEC championship.”",Charlette Hall,sports,https://www.redandblack.com/sports/georgia-equestrian-senior-class-searches-for-first-sec-championship/article_b2e96e84-b5df-11e3-804f-001a4bcf6878.html
27-Mar-14,Spring Fever epidemic takes hold of campus,"Athens has finally begun to thaw after it experienced a daunting two inches of snow earlier this semester. Students began to fear they would never be able to don cut-off shorts or Chacos ever again. However, the sun has finally begun to show itself. As the weather peaks at a balmy 70 degrees, hammocks and acoustic guitars run rampant amongst hacky sack circles and sunbathers on North Campus.Spring Fever is an unusual ailment found in college students. Symptoms include wearing crop tops in 65 degree weather, Instagram photos of “the first flowers of spring” and the tagline “#SpringSprangSprung” following every social media update.Following the contraction of the illness, those afflicted become convinced that they are a nature photographer for National Geographic and proceed to take photos of trees, grass and other plant life; at its most extreme, victims take the photos at 45 degree angles in black and white and claim this monstrosity is art.


 


There is also a distinct possibility that a Spring Fever victim will become unable to control themselves around an acoustic guitar. They grow completely obsessed with the notion of strumming a John Mayer song that displays their innate sensitivity and “individuality.” Warning signs of this sympotom can range anywhere from a backwards baseball cap to free-verse poetry. Males between the ages of 18-24 are most at risk and they are almost always flanked by girls professing their deep admiration of the player’s emotional depth.Nearly every infected person exhibits a total disregard for their surrounding environment. Consumed by their determination, Spring Fever victims force themselves into shorts and tank tops simply because their calendar claims that the seasons have changed, though the weather begs to differ. At its worst, they brave 50 degree weather in their swimsuits to rebel against the cold weather. They will get a tan, even if it kills them.It appears that victims of Spring Fever appear to be somewhat self-aware. Although they wear shorts and tank tops amidst of group of people still shivering in their winter wear, Spring Fever victims have been known to accompany their summer clothing with woolen atrocities known as Ugg boots. This phenomenon has puzzled researchers for years. Do the infected know how weather works? Or is this some sinister fashion trend from the depths of Dante’s inferno?There is no cure for Spring Fever. It affects even the strongest of souls.

29-Mar-14,Researchers find greener way to make blood thinner compound,"Around 2 million people a day take blood thinners to prevent blood clots, and one of the most common anticoagulant medications is warfarin.University of Georgia researchers have discovered a greener way to produce 4 hydroxycoumarin, an important molecule in warfarin normally produced using a petroleum-based chemical synthesis.“This is a precursor for the product warfarin,” said Yajun Yan, an assistant professor in the College of Engineering. “It has a market of over $300 million. And many people are taking it and so if we can get an efficient approach to produce this compound, it’s going to have a huge impact.”


 


Yuheng Lin, a fourth-year postdoctoral student in biological engineering, worked on the project and said Yan’s research group was the first to take this approach to producing 4HC. He said the traditional methods might not be sustainable.“They currently use chemical approaches to produce these drugs and the process is not environmentally friendly because they use petroleum-related chemicals as raw material to produce this compound,” Lin said. “If the price of petroleum keeps going up then this raw material price will keep going up also. And we want to use a renewable approach to produce these kinds of drugs.”Besides the practical applications of the research, Yan said, the project also provided some insights into missing links in how the compound is produced naturally. He said the process was also being tested for the production of other compounds and that the researchers were beginning to look for industry partners to explore the feasibility of the biological process for industry production.“The way we approach that is to transfer this technology or transfer this knowledge or the rights we have to the technology to companies that are able to assess that applicability in the industrial, commercial or clinical setting,” said Gennaro Gama, a senior technology licensing manager at UGA. “Even though the compound is known to have anticoagulant properties, it is not manufactured in the traditional way that it is, so because of that it has to go through a regulatory process. Since universities are not in the business of developing products but companies are, that is when the need to partner with a company arises.”While the licensing and patenting processes themselves take relatively little time if all goes well, said Derek Eberhart, director of the Technology Commercialization Office, putting a product on the market can take a lot longer.“One of the drugs that came out of the University is a hepatitis B drug which is on the market in Korea,” Eberhart said. “It’s called clevudine. So from the time we got the first disclosure, we filed a patent within a year. Licensed it within another year, so pretty quick in that phase of it, but then it was about 10 to 12 years before they got the actual product to the market. So it’s a long and expensive project to get through regulatory trials.”Gama said it’s a buyer’s market for this type of product, so UGA will market the product to all possible buyers, including pharmaceutical companies and companies that do the bio-manufacturing for pharmaceutical companies.“Our job as a land grant college, one of the missions, is to improve the lives of Georgians,” Eberhart said. “So if there’s discoveries that can translate into products that can do that, then we want to try to be a part of doing that.”

2-Apr-14,UGA alumnus Bobby Cool returns as performer,"Known to many people for its rich music scene, Athens is equally known for its excessive party culture. For Nashville-based singer and songwriter Bobby Cool, Athens is personally remembered for both.Like many students who first enter the University of Georgia, handling the city’s over-the-top nature was difficult for Cool.“When I first got to college, I was just immersed in the party scene and got in trouble, got arrested a couple of times and really was kind of spiraling downhill,” Cool said.


 


During his time at UGA, Cool encountered both music performance and religion at around the same time.This was the beginnings of laying out an influence for his future career as a singer and songwriter.“For the first couple years of college, I just played [guitar] in the dorm room or apartment and just started learning songs, but being immersed in the Athens music scene … I caught the bug and wanted to do it. So junior year I played my first show,” Cool said. “About the same time I started playing music live, God was just doing a lot of things, putting a lot of people in my life.”Cool continued to perform around Athens for the rest of his UGA career, but his real entrance into the music scene didn’t happen until he moved to Tennessee for unrelated reasons.“I graduated in December 2008 and moved to Nashville in January 2009 and really then began my education in the music industry,” Cool said. “I was working for an insurance company at the time, but was playing and writing and meeting a lot of people.”The musical style that Cool developed in his new home isn’t much of a surprise — country. Cool’s style, however, isn’t necessarily what people generally think of when the word “country” is used as a musical adjective. Cool takes influence from both the Nashville scene and other Southern genres.“The way that I’ve been describing it is ‘rootsy-country,’” Cool said. “But, there are totally influences of singer songwriter, some rock ‘n’ roll influences.”Cool’s upcoming debut album, “Light In The Dark,” is titled after what he feels represents his change in lifestyle.


 


Though it lyrically features a religious aura, Cool’s upcoming release wouldn't fit among gospel and other Christian recordings, being a secular album with religious influences“Specifically, no — it definitely is not a religious album,” Cool said. “But, if you’re looking for it, there are gospel undertones.”More than simply an artist on stage singing to a crowd, Cool’s live shows are a constant intercommunication between himself and the audience — and that’s exactly how Cool likes it.“I would say its very high energy — a lot of interaction, a lot of back and forth, give and take with the crowd,” Cool said. “Thats what I enjoy most is playing and interacting with the crowd. That’s where I kind of get my kick.”Though Cool developed himself musically in Nashville, he hasn’t forgotten where his roots lie in the field and his beginnings in his style of music began.Cool is looking forward to his upcoming return to Athens, but his final goal regarding his venue of choice has yet to be met, as he has his eyes set on one of Athens' premier venues.“Athens is where I learned to play music, it’s where I fell in love with the idea of pursuing music as a career and its home. Every time I go back it’s just like a breath of fresh air,” Cool said. “I’m dreaming about the day when I get to play the Georgia Theatre.”He hasn't reached his dream venue yet, but he’s taking the first steps.

3-Apr-14,Changing needs of police contribute to evolution of cop cars,"Innovative technology, changing expectations of police officers and maintenance concerns contribute the evolution of police cars in Athens.“When we sit down and look at cars [to buy], we’re looking at use, comfort to the officer and other people that we provide rides to, and maintenance cost that we have experienced with vehicles for similar type designs and that’s how we start making our choices,” said University of Georgia Police Chief Jimmy Williamson.Williamson said the UGA Police Department has roughly 20 cars for about 88 people. The police car is the officer’s office and the car is running almost continuously. Because he said officers put around 30,000 miles on a car each year, the cars have to be sustainable.


 


“When the Ford Expedition first became available on state contract, we bought some,” Williamson said. “We ran the Expedition two years longer than we ran the Ford Crown Victorias. We normally got three to three-and-a-half years from the Crown Victorias and we were able to get about four-and-a-half to five years out of the [Ford] Expeditions.”Initial price and cost in the long run also affect decisions police make about which cars to buy.“We’re probably never going to explore buying all-wheel-drive cars because of the maintenance issues,” Williamson said. “Some cars we can get for probably about $2,500 less than a Chevrolet Tahoe, but what we found is we spend probably close to two to three times that money on repairs on the front end because they don’t hold up well, whereas in Athens-Clarke County, they might hold up better because they have a bigger geographical area they cover, so there is not as much turning.”He said the SUVs the department buys cost about $25,000 on the state contract and they last longer than small sedan cars.“If you look far back University of Georgia police used to drive station wagons, so to me it’s kind of funny that we have kind of made a circle because the two-wheel drive SUVs that we drive are basically a station wagon in my mind,” Williamson said.Carter Greene, assistant chief of ACC police, said he has been in law enforcement since 1984 and he uses very different cars now then he used to use when he began working.“We’ve come from large sedans that were made specifically for police to front wheel drive smaller four door sedans, as well as hybrid vehicles,” Green said.


 


Greene said cars are also more gas efficient and safer due to technology than 30 years ago.“They have air bags, locking brake systems and sensors,” Greene said. “We added blue lights and a siren. We installed cameras, computers and mobile data terminals that officers use to write reports, get calls and run tags.”While ACC experiments with the most efficient cop cars, Greene said in the future, they will continue using Chevrolet Impalas and Toyota Priuses.Dan Silk, a part time instructor in the criminal justice department, said the police cars that are used have been standardized until recently.“Over the last 20 years, there has been some pretty consistent staples of American police cars until about the last five or six years,” Silk said. “For a long time, the only two options that anybody really had or really pursued were the Chevrolet Caprices, which was a rear wheel drive V8 car and the Ford Crown Victoria police interceptor, which is also a rear wheel drive V8 car, but neither of those are made anymore so eventually they are going to be extinct.”Silk said Ford discontinued production on the Crown Victorias for financial reasons.


TNCMS.AdManager.render({region: 'fixed-big-ad-bottom-asset', slot: 1, fold: ""below""});


“To you and me, it looks like they are everywhere, but as far as market share, for Ford, it was a small share for overall global market so it wasn’t financially sustainable for them to build it anymore when the only people that drove them were cops and taxi cab drivers,” Silk said.Silk said police cars have also changed because of shifting expectations for police officers.“Police overall now compared to 20 years ago, day in and day out, are expected to bring so much more equipment with them, whether that’s tactical equipment or life saving equipment or communications equipment,” Silk said. “It’s a different environment so as a profession, police generally use more space than they used to.”",Michelle Baruchman @mlbaruchman,cops,https://www.redandblack.com/cops/changing-needs-of-police-contribute-to-evolution-of-cop-cars/article_f49fd644-b538-11e3-8f22-001a4bcf6878.html
3-Apr-14,Fashion designers collaborate for museum of art,"The Athens Fashion Collective will be featured at the Georgia Museum of Art’s Museum Mix on Thursday night and will feature a spring collection collaboration between Paper-Cut-Projects and Megan Huntz.“It’s been great,” Huntz said. “I’ve known Amy [Flurry] and Nikki [Nye] of Paper-Cut-Projects for some time, and we became friends through our mutual interest in fashion. I’ve always wanted to collaborate with them and when they told me about the Athens Fashion Collective I knew I had to do it. I’m really excited.”Huntz has a background in industrial design and studied fashion in Milan. Following graduation, she worked with denim design in Italy. After working with washing and treating denim fabric, Huntz expanded her horizons and began experimenting with silk washing and dying.


 


“I decided to design my own brand,” Huntz said. “It was new, fresh and never seen before. I worked with the enrichment of textiles through washing and dying, and then I started adding digital prints.”One of Huntz’s iconic spring works features photographic images printed on silk.Huntz visited the Georgia mountains with a photographer. She placed silk just under the surface of water and then printed that image on the fabric.“It’s a meta concept. I like to incorporate a strong artistic concept. There is so much stuff out there in the world and I always like to have a strong link to something artsy,” Huntz said.Paper-Cut-Projects founders Flurry and Nye also coined their own brand by creating paper accessories with only glue and an X-Acto knife.Their works have been featured in the Lincoln Center for New York Fashion Week alongside world-renowned clothing designers including Cartier and Valentino.“We make a lot of paper wigs,” Flurry said. “They’re very sculptural. It’s not origami; they’re engineered pieces created by precision cutting. This collection will have bold creations. There’s a collar of feathers, over-sized arm cuffs and some hair pieces as well.”Paper-Cut-Projects is largely an abstract brand, featured in runway shows and magazines. Much like Huntz’s work, the pieces are fantastical and artistic but retain and organic feel.


 


Both Nye and Flurry are heavily involved in the creative process to create cohesion throughout their collections.“Our lead designer has worked in paper for over 10 years. I was coming out of magazines, producing and styling fashion, which leaves you in this fantasy. Fantasy is fashion. These are the things stylists create for a page or runway show,” Flurry said.The collection featured this Thursday will present Huntz’s fabrics alongside Paper-Cut-Project’s elaborate accessories. Huntz created a line of monochromatic hand-dyed blue silk to compliment the woodlands-inspired paper accessory line.“It’s really amazing. The blue has such depth and it contrasts with the white,” Huntz said. “I was interested in how all of the pieces would aesthetically go together. It’s like two sides of the same coin, but not an exact copy of that coin.”Museum Mix is free and open to the public. All of the Georgia Museum of Art galleries will be open and refreshments will be provided. DJ Winston Parker will be providing additional musical entertainment.",Courtney Willett @courtney_say,variety,https://www.redandblack.com/variety/fashion-designers-collaborate-for-museum-of-art/article_5841d032-baa5-11e3-a0eb-0017a43b2370.html
3-Apr-14,Town & Gown Players resurrect ‘Oklahoma!’,"The Athens Town & Gown Players are putting on the Rodgers and Hammerstein classic ‘Oklahoma!’ which debuts April 4.This classic work of musical theater will be performed by local professional actors with live music and no electric modification. The cast and crew are determined to stay true to the show’s roots, through the groups’ attempt to use instrumentation similar to that of the original ‘Oklahoma!’ productions.“I love the music,” said Derek Adams, director and University of Georgia alumnus. “This is one of those shows were I feel that as long as human culture exists, we will be doing ‘Oklahoma!’ It’s a show that is exactly what it is. It’s not trying to mimic anything, and it’s not trying to copy anything, because it is the first modern musical. It created that form. It’s almost like doing Shakespeare.”


 


“Oklahoma!” premiered in 1943 and marked a ground-breaking turn in musical drama. Rodgers and Hammerstein were the first to fully utilize song and dance as a form of exposition rather than a diversion from the story. The creators additionally were the first to introduce the condradiction of dark villains in a happy cartoonish environment.“The more I learned about how groundbreaking “Oklahoma!” was, the more I got into it,” said Dustin Ah Kuoi, playing Ali Hakim. “The more we do rehearsals, the more I love the show … The dialogue is really smart and funny and fast-paced. It’ll be a fun show for anyone that comes.”“Oklahoma!” has an overarching theme of the pursuit of “the American dream” all while telling the story of two people too stubborn to admit their affections for each other.Set in 1906 American Indian territory, the musical delves into the power struggle and class conflict between cowboys, farmers and peddlers.In spite of its poignant political message, “Oklahoma!” retains a cheery persona with its quick humor and the upbeat numbers more recent musicals are full of.“‘Oklahoma!’ is just always a show I had loved and always wanted to do,” said Mackenzie Marr, a second-year majoring in piano performance and music education from Augusta playing Ado Annie. “We're working on making [the characters] realistic but kind of like cartoons. The world they live in is realistic but not real.”The cast and crew are eager to do the classic musical justice. It’s an interesting work, with several strange plot components and complex characters. Although the play is somewhat cartoonish, characters remain multi-dimensional and dynamic. The production overall is true to itself and conveys a distinct message without any confusing subtext or hidden meaning.“My whole goal is to have a very cohesive and really solid production of this show. To make it come together, you have to make it fun, make it fast and have really good performers and singers and dancers. We just do the show,” Adams said.


 


Rodgers and Hammerstein debuted with “Oklahoma!” and proceeded to create famous pieces such as “The Sound of Music,” “Cinderella,” and “The King and I.”These timeless pieces have a signature style of witty dialect, catchy songs and thought-provoking plots. Song, dance and lyrics come together to move the story forward and convey mature themes. The show will be fit for audience members of all ages, with drama for the adults, and fun musical numbers for children.“It’s a great show to just turn your brain off and watch people singing and dancing and having fun,” Adams said.",Courtney Willett @courtney_say,variety,https://www.redandblack.com/variety/town-gown-players-resurrect-oklahoma/article_09f920ce-baa5-11e3-9838-0017a43b2370.html
3-Apr-14,Football practice report: A week of practices left before G-Day,"This time next week, Georgia will be making its final touch ups before the annual G-Day game. The team has just four practices remaining before teeing it up in Sanford Stadium on April 12. The Bulldogs donned pads again on Thursday on what was one of the hottest practices of the spring season.The media was given access to two periods totaling 10 minutes. Here are some observations:
Tailback Dominic Bryan, cornerback Reggie Wilkerson, tailback Keith Marshall, offensive lineman Watts Danzler and receiver Justin Scott-Wesley all donned green jerseys for practice. Danzler stood off to the side of offensive line drills while Bryan and Scott-Wesley ran off on the side. Marshall and Wilkerson participated in position drills.
The defense worked its typical 11-man swarm-to-the-ball drill during the first media period. Senior Damian Swann and redshirt freshman Aaron Davis worked the first-team cornerbacks, ahead of Wilkerson and junior Devin Bowman on the second team. Once again sophomore Tray Matthews was a first-team safety, but worked with former tailback and sophomore J.J. Green. Senior Corey Moore and junior Brendan Langley made up the second-team defensive backs.
When the second media period began, the defense broke into two groups and worked on backpedaling and changing direction. Apparently moving much better after his meniscus and ACL injuries, Wilkerson was told by coaches, “fast Reggie, fast, fast, fast.”
Head coach Mark Richt closely observed the quarterbacks and receivers during a drill in which they faked a handoff to an imaginary running back and then threw a post route to a receiver. Senior Hutson Mason continued to throw to senior Chris Conley.
The offensive line worked one-on-one drills in which they practiced pushing back a fellow lineman with a blocking pad, simulating a defensive lineman. The first-team offensive line appeared to be John Theus at left tackle, Zach DeBell at left guard, David Andrews at center, Greg Pyke at right guard and Kolton Houston at right tackle.

4-Apr-14,Turn Me On!: 'Parks and Recreation' goes to prom,"It’s easy to be nostalgic about an event like the prom.Even if it wasn’t that fun, prom happens during a point in people’s lives where things likely aren’t as complicated as they should be, could be or will be. You either haven’t yet applied for college or have already decided what you’re doing after high school. It comes during the victory lap part of the final semester, and even if it didn’t go as well as you might have hoped, it still represents what was probably a good point in time.That’s why it is so critical that each character tells at least part of their prom story. It gives the viewer a hint at what their lives were like before the window to their lives was opened in season one. Some fun stuff gets revealed:


 


Leslie planned her own prom as a distraction from choosing her college.Ron went to prom at 12 and never looked back.The ages of Donna’s preferred men have likely remained at 25 since she was 18.Ben, as a humiliated, impeached mayor, didn’t get to go to prom.Andy’s prom was basically what most 17 year old's dream to get out of their evening.What’s even more crucial, however, is what isn’t revealed until later in the episode. April didn’t go to prom, because she probably thought she was too cool, but skipping an event like that is something people come to regret.Even though the scene with Orin dressed as April’s mother, and champion dressed as her father, is good for an (extremely) awkward laugh, it also comes with a bit of a bite. While Andy seeks to relive the prom he had when he was in high school, April wants to have the prom she missed: she just has to cloak it in a few layers of weirdness to avoid the appearance of caring.When she sees Andy revert back to his high school self, she realizes not only what different people they began as, but also what different people they grew into. But, to sound sappy, it isn’t about what they share within their personalities, but the love they share. That’s why it is so fulfilling to see Andy steal that crown for April, and make her hidden prom dream a reality.


 


Now, that gem of a B-plot was hidden behind a solid A-plot following Leslie and Ron in their eternal ideological struggle. Yes, it was funny but heartwarming at the end, and yes we have seen this plot a dozen times before in this series. The twist of their trying to corrupt a high school dead ringer for Leslie was a fun twist, but not as fun as the return of Greg Pikitis.Tom realizing that he’s out of touch with today’s youth wasn’t as strong as the other plots, though it is was nice to see Ben finally get to be the cool one. Given the obsession millennials seem to have with vinyl, it makes sense that Ben would get to be a hit.The A-Plot between Ron and Leslie might have felt obligatory given the comical and emotional heft of the Andy-April plot, but it still made good use of pushing Leslie forward. The question is, how can she keep moving forward without leaving Pawnee?Stray ObservationsIt’s amazing that Andy’s analysis of “Expendables 2” comes the same day as the release of the “Expendables 3” trailer.Whoever’s idea it was to have that single student excited about the internship announcement needs a raise.I didn’t see any peaches on the snack table, but of course Greg had one anyway.Next week, the show will continue its trend of using titles to get us nostalgic for older episodes that was started with the second “Galentine’s Day.” We’ll have to see if “Flu Season 2” can stand up to its predecessor.

4-Apr-14,Turn Me On!: 'Scandal' gets serious before finale,"As the final episode of ""Scandal"" before the fourth season finale, ""The Fluffer"" was misleadingly light on the sex and hard on the actual plot development (pun completely intended.)While we did have to sit through Olivia going all ""Behind Enemy Lines"" and having sex with Jake in order to hack into his phone (I guess the whole Indiana Jones-style swap of equally weighted objects was out of the question), but for the most part it was (non-sexual) stuff happening to move the plot toward the season finale.To answer all of our lingering questions from IMDB's episode schedule, ""The Fluffer"" refers to the (non-sexual) encounter between Olivia and Fitz where every bad thing Papa Pope has ever said about Fitz was confirmed. Olivia is Fitz's fluffer. She makes him feel good and excited so he can go out and be president, and that's it. There is no true love story here. There is some sad co-dependency and serious daddy issues (on both sides), but this is not a romance. The audience has known it for a while. Finally Olivia knows it, too.


 


Speaking of sad, weird sex, Mellie and future VP Nichols went down the drain in less than three episodes, which has to be some sort of record for this show. When Mellie slapped Fitz in the middle of his strategy meeting, I cheered. I wanted to get up and dance. I wanted to print up ""Team Mellie"" t-shirts and start selling them illegally over the internet.Fitz is weak and cowardly and selfish, and he is the most powerful man in America. What does that say about our (fictional) political system? Olivia should have married that senate majority guy and avoided his train wreck of a life. Every great thing that she (and Mellie) could've been is destroyed by his suckiness. Even crazy Jake Ballard and his psycho army of government spies would be preferable at this point.On the Jake Ballard side of things, I cannot help but feel that he is the next name on Shonda Rhimes' character kill list. He was going completely off the rails trying to get Olivia back (or in the first place), and his job as command is cracking him in half mentally. Now that Olivia duped him into pretending she actually wanted to be with him, he has just the right level of tragedy to make his death memorable, even if he did kill James.In terms of complaints, I cannot believe we didn't get a peek into the Langston campaign after the news of Sally's daughter's abortion entered the media circus surrounding the presidential campaign. Watching Sally be generally crazy is fun when nothing is going wrong. Why were we not allowed a peek into her Vesuvius of religious psychosis at its peak?As crazy a mother as Langston is, however, nobody is as crazy a mother as Mama Pope. What are she and Adnan Salif going to do with the ""Mona Lisa of bombs"" they've acquired? Thanks to Olivia's misguided take down of B613, nobody is going to know until next week. We have no idea why they're supposedly gunning for Fitz. The only other person who's threatened Fitz's life this season would be...Daddy Pope. Who wants to bet that Mama Pope is in collusion with Daddy Pope, and all the info he gave Olivia is just part of the long con?Only the finale will tell. It's tentatively titled ""Flesh and Blood,"" and seeing as ""The Fluffer"" was so misleading, I'm not going to make any more predictions based on titles. For all we know this could be the name of the rock band Jake, Quinn, Charlie and Daddy Pope form now that they're all out of work.",Chelsey Abercrombie @comma_freak,variety,https://www.redandblack.com/variety/turn-me-on-scandal-gets-serious-before-finale/article_07580e44-bc61-11e3-9bd2-0017a43b2370.html
4-Apr-14,"Booze prices alter drinking pros, cons","University of Georgia students may not be consciously calculating the cost-benefits of consuming alcohol, but their brains could already being doing this for them.Associate professor of psychology James MacKillop is studying how the brain makes decisions about drinking alcohol, as well as how it weighs the pros and cons of drinking.The study was tested through a bar laboratory alcohol procedure in order to assess how the cost of alcohol affected the amount people consumed.


 


MacKillop said his lab is focused on understanding drinking and alcohol misuse by studying it live in the lab or using a combination of brain imagining.“In our study we measure the perceived pros of drinking by how much a person chooses to drink,” MacKillop said. “We measured the cons by how much the cost of drinking suppressed their drinking.”For the experiment, MacKillop said he focused on 24 heavy male drinkers between the ages of 21 and 31.“We were able to identify regions in the brain that are using more oxygen during different kinds of choices,” he said. “By identifying these regions, we were able to infer that they required more activity.”MacKillop said the result showed a variety of different brain activity.“When people were no longer willing to drink because the price was too high, we saw they had high activity in the anterior insula,” MacKillop said. “So it seemed like the insula was very important for characterizing how much person felt like the cost outweighed the benefits.”According to PubMed, the anterior insula plays a role in decision making and sudden insight.“Finding that the anterior insula was high in activity when cost of drinking outweighed the benefits could mean that this region of the brain is the intersection where our rational and irrational systems work together,” MacKillop said.


 


But MacKillop said when people were not affected by cost, there were different patterns in the brain.“There was selectively greater activity in an area in the brain called the cuneus, which has been associated with the value of possessions,” he said. “And there was high activity in the posterior cingulate.”UGA Police Chief Jimmy Williamson said he encounters a number of students at UGA who have consumed alcohol daily.“Most students are in a position aren’t aware of some of the risk of consuming since most people aren’t talking about whether you should or you shouldn’t drink,” Williamson said. “There are no really good examples of responsible consumption which cause many students to go down the path of heavy drinking.”According to UGAPD’s crime statistics 406 people were arrested for alcohol-related instances in 2012. And in 2013, 339 people were arrested for alcohol-related instances.“It may be DUI or underage drinking or public drunkeness,"" Williamson said. ""Many of our students are capable of purchasing alcohol easily at the current pricing in the area.”MacKillop said people think about alcohol use disorders as a disorder of decision making.“In the future, we are hoping that we can use this experiment and methodology to understand what types of neural activity is different with individuals with alcohol-use disorders relative to healthy drinkers,” he said.

6-Apr-14,Weekly freshman migration may deter out-of-state students,"An exodus, by definition, is a mass departure of people. The image that many conjure when thinking about an exodus is the Israelites being led out of Egypt in the critically acclaimed Dreamworks film “Prince of Egypt.” Or maybe you hear Morgan Freeman’s mellifluous bellow as a migrating flock of flamingos flies on an episode of “Earth.”Or maybe you, like me, have been in a Freshman lobby on a Friday afternoon. Pack after pack of Freshmen students trundle down in ones and twos, arms filled with dirty laundry bags and middle school Vera Bradley gym bags full of overnight necessities. There are the overpackers, the under packers and the I’m-putting-everything-in-a-garbage-bag packers. And when Sunday night rolls around they’ll be back just in time to take your parking spot as they lug everything back to the dorms. But just what effect is this having on the student body at the University of Georgia?


 


Is it because UGA accepts so many kids for whom home is just an hour drive in any direction? In-state kids make up a vast majority of the UGA student body, and by vast I mean in the 86% range. That’s thanks to the HOPE scholarship. But because of this, is UGA becoming an inhospitable place for out-of-state students? When a dead weekend comes up, one with dreary weather that keeps many but the truly alcohol-dependent from venturing out to the bars of Athens, the anthill of freshman dorms is overturned. It is then that out-of-state kids realize how vastly in the minority they are. It’s not economically feasible to use a plane ticket every time you want to go home or take a 5-hour car trip back to North Carolina or Tennessee.“It’s a really hard transition,” said freshman Katie Davis, a North Carolina native. “A lot of people are very disappointed when they come here and find that many weekends are spent alone in the dorms when your friend group decides to take off for a weekend.”And that’s true. Some freshmen find the transition of leaving their out-of-state home and then being unable to return, like the rest of their peers, too daunting to manage. I remember seeing a hall mate of mine from Ohio pack up at the end of the first semester, citing crippling homesickness, and transferring to a college back home. Is UGA losing its appeal to out-of-state kids thanks to HOPE? Perhaps. With the scholarship program in place, a decent number of out-of-state kids shy away from UGA after one semester, feeling overwhelmed by the amount of Atlanta area, Johns Creek and Roswell kids who decided to extend high school an extra four years. Perhaps this mass exodus is doing away with the steady community out-of-state kids long for when they leave their own pre-existing communities back home. I would say that when in-state kids leave for a ‘dead’ weekend, they are losing the best chance to form bonds with people in their dorm. With less going on, there is a greater chance of smaller groups in which to interact with. With less people, you have more opportunities for meaningful encounters and lasting bonds. 


 


If at the first sign of boredom people scurry from their dorms back to the comfort of their parents’ houses, are we really learning to be independent? We’ve all left home now, and that’s how it should stay. None of this half-way going-back-every-other-weekend stuff but true, honest independence. Being bored is a part of growing up, of learning that not every second of your life is going to be filled with conversation and partying. I find it a detriment to UGA that we cannot, as a class of freshmen, decide that now we are adults, we are unique and that we should be trying to interact with a diversified group of students, including our out-of-state classmates, instead of returning to our families. That is what growing up is all about, throwing yourself into possibly uncomfortable situations and learning more about who you are in the process. This is what is going to make the community at UGA more welcoming to out-of-state kids and, in turn, will create a more mature, and diverse freshman class. —Shelby Masters is a freshman from Johns Creek majoring in pre-journalism","Shelby Masters

9-Apr-14,Athens Rails Girls seek to close gender gap in web development,"Rails Girls, an international organization dedicated to educating girls in the Ruby on Rails coding language, came to Athens last weekend with the help of community members and Rails Girls members alike.“This is something I’ve wanted to do for a while in Athens,” said Jordan Burke, the CTO and lead developer at Vitamin C, a web development company based in the FourAthens building.Burke is a member of the Athens chapter of Rails Girls, who were responsible for organizing the event.


 


Over the course of two days, students and community members alike were welcomed to learn the basics of Ruby on Rails from a variety of Athens and Atlanta-based coaches, some of whom are members of the Atlanta Rails Girls chapter.Attendees came from as far away as Pittsburgh to participate over the weekend.“I would say it’s probably about 50-50 mixed,” Burke said, referring to the number of University of Georgia students versus community members who attended the Rails Girls weekend. “All the attendees except for one are female.”Coaches worked closely with participants to help them understand Rails and design a web application.Invented in 2004, Ruby on Rails or simply “Rails,” is a coding language widely lauded in the programming community for its simplicity and accessibility to individuals learning how to code for the first time.Much of Ruby on Rails’ appeal comes from the fact that it’s an open source coding language, meaning anybody can download, view and learn it.Ruby on Rails has been used to develop many high profile websites, including Twitter.While Rails Girls is an international organization, many coaches see their role as an act of giving back to their local communities.


 


“When I began to learn this stuff, I would go online and find people who had more experience, ask them questions,” said Jonathan Wallace, a Rails Girls coach and web developer from Watkinsville. “They would respond and help me out and help me through problems that I might face, so for me this is a chance to do that and give back to the community and people who are just starting in this, the same that others did for me.”Male participants are allowed to take part in Rails Girls events, but the primary goal of the Rails Girls organization is to get more females fluent and interested in programming and coding.The first night of the event included a viewing of a documentary by She++, an organization of female computer science students at Stanford who seek to empower women in technological fields.Groups like She++ and Rails Girls seeks to address the dearth of women in technological fields, a disproportionality which is quickly becoming a pressing sociological and economic problem.“By 2020, there will be three jobs for software developers for every American there is to fill them,” Burke said. “If we increase proportionally the number of female computer science undergraduates by 2020, there will still be two jobs per every graduate.”Such an absence of skilled workers can cause profitable companies to move their businesses away from the United States, which can have a detrimental effect on the American economy as a whole.The subconscious belief that technology and engineering are strictly boys-only fields exacerbates this issue.“It’s a huge growth field,” Wallace said. “There’s such a demand in the industry in general that I feel like if we grabbed everybody we still wouldn’t have enough people to get it done. We can’t artificially limit who we reach out to.”


TNCMS.AdManager.render({region: 'fixed-big-ad-bottom-asset', slot: 1, fold: ""below""});


Kylie Stradley, a 2011 graduate from Georgia Tech and a Rails Girls coach from Atlanta, scratches her head over the disproportionality of females to males in STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) fields.“Women are almost 60 percent of college graduates, but we’re only about 18-20 percent of college graduates in STEM fields, which is kind of weird,” Stradley said. “Don’t you think it would be a bit closer to our graduation rates?”Stradley became a Rails Girls coach after other Rails Girls coaches helped her learn the language and she discovered the open nature of their community.“They helped me get my system set up, they helped me understand what I was actually writing instead of typing random things and having no idea what’s going on,” Stradley said. “I ultimately picked Ruby on Rails and stuck with Ruby on Rails because we have a really friendly, open community.Stradley believes in the importance of women learning to code and program if that’s their desire.“We always have people saying girls can’t or shouldn’t do things, so it’s important to me to let everyone know that girls can and should be trying to do whatever they want,” Stradley said. “If you want to learn it, you should.”Elizabeth Vitale, a graphic designer from Watkinsville and a Rails Girls participant, pointed out there was a time when education in the STEM fields did not address women at all.“I went to a women’s college, and we didn’t even have anything remotely related to fields of technology,” Vitale said. “The alums I know who got into it got into it because they were smart and trainable, but not because they had any actual experience in school.”

Vitale attended the weekend to learn new skills that will help her in her professional life.“I’m hoping to get a basic understand of programming and be able to apply it to my job, my profession, and also to be able to communicate more effectively with people who do use the technology,” Vitale said.Even in 2014, the number of female STEM students is staggeringly low compared to their male counterparts.“There are few women in my computer science classes right now,” said Nagi Argiriou, a third-year computer science major from Brunswick.Argiriou, who first learned about the Rails Girls event on Facebook, attended out of curiosity and also in hopes of applying her knowledge of Rails to her job at WUOG.“I think it would be great to reach out to that whole half of the population and say it’s here,” Argiriou said.While the organization does allow male participants, Stradley thinks the focus on prioritizing female participation benefits a section of the population that is finally catching up with its male counterparts in the world of technology.“It helps a lot, because a lot of guys have been working in these languages for a long time, and even if they’re new to Rails they might be bringing in a lot of information from other languages, maybe showing off a bit, things like that, and that can be really intimidating when you’re brand new,” Stradley said. “That’s why we try to keep it primarily female-focused, but obviously if someone wants to learn they can come and learn.”

In the course of two days, participants also experienced the community the Rails Girls organization has created around itself—a group of women and men focused on empowering and inspiring peers to learn and innovate.“I really like the community and the people here,” Argiriou said. “They’re very passionate, and you can tell. You can tell they really like to help other people, and I think that’s great.”The next stateside Rails Girls’ weekends will be held in Philadelphia from April 25-26 and Baltimore from May 9-10.Whether it is addressing an economic, gender or educational gap, the coaches and participants in Athens’ Ruby on Rails weekend might not yet recognize the power of the education they received.“I’m a firm believer in the fact that when you want to create things you need an intersection of different experiences and different perspectives, and by increasing the awareness and opportunities for anyone in technology you’re going to be increasing those innovations,” Burke said.",Chelsey Abercrombie @comma_freak,variety,https://www.redandblack.com/variety/athens-rails-girls-seek-to-close-gender-gap-in-web/article_950b5882-bf94-11e3-b64c-0017a43b2370.html

17-Apr-14,Football practice report: Bulldogs take field for final spring practice,"Georgia football held its final practice of the spring on Thursday. After a chilly morning in Athens, the weather was on the warmer side for practice time as the coaching staff gets one last look at players until summer camp begins.The media had access to the first two periods of practice for about 15 minutes. Here are some observations:
Tailback Dominic Bryan, tailback Keith Marshall, receiver Justin Scott-Wesley and tight end Jay Rome all sported green non-contact jerseys. Marshall and Scott-Wesley participated in varying degrees during media availability while Bryan and Rome were off to the side.
Running backs worked on high stepping over bags during the first period. Marshall fully participated in this drill.
Quarterbacks began practice by warming up, throwing back and forth to each other in pairs. Hutson Mason threw with Faton Bauta and Jacob Park threw with Brice Ramsey.
Receivers ran a slow-paced drill in which they jogged forward at an angle, planted their foot and then pushed back. Scott-Wesley participated in this drill but went off to the side when the group began running routes.
Cornerbacks and safeties split up, with cornerbacks practicing jamming a receiver at the line of scrimmage on a blocking sled and then pursuing a ball thrown by a coach. Safeties did a similar drill where they dropped back into open space and pursued a ball. Free safety Tray Matthews was absent from practice today. However, J.J. Green was back at practice wearing a normal jersey.
Defensive linemen worked on driving a blocking sled toward the end of the media periods. Defensive line coach Tracy Rocker was particularly fired up about the grouping of Jon Taylor, John Atkins and Jordan Jenkins.

21-Apr-14,Fans disappointed as country music strays from its roots,"Whether you love it or you hate it, country music is a genre that lives in the hearts of many people around the world. When most people think of this type of music they may think about Willie Nelson, George Strait or Hank Williams Jr. However, there is a new brand of country music that is determined to change the way that people think about the genre forever. Enter Luke Bryan, Florida-Georgia Line and many other beloved “country” singers. With a new change in the genre, pop and rap has somehow reared its head into a great deal of country songs heard on the radio today. Songs such as “That’s My Kind of Night” and “This Is How We Roll” boasts lyrics that many country fans don’t recognize as being part of their lifestyle. Lyrics such as “The mixtape’s got a little Hank, a little Drake” could cause Conway Twitty to roll over his grave. On top of these lyrics that are changing the country music world, there is also an entirely new focus on the way that country music is being performed. Sure, there may still be some cowboy boots or a cowboy hat in some performances, but more often than not country stars are trying to bling up not only their wardrobe, but also their style of dance. Tight jeans, bejeweled collar shirts and short skirts have become the norm for these pop-like country singers, along with provocative dance moves that have proven to be quite different from the stool and guitar performance of decades past. 


 


However, some country music stars are determined to stick to their roots of what they know and love about country music. Singers such as the Zac Brown Band and Eric Church are unwavering in their attempts to keep country’s folk background alive. With a focus on family, hometowns and all things country running rampant through their lyrics, they bring the genre back to it’s home base. Lyrics such as “Well I was raised up beneath the shade of a Georgia Pine/ And that’s home you know/ Sweet tea, pecan pie, and homemade wine/ Where the peaches grow” are lyrics that country music fans can really identify with that stick to the real roots of the country genre. Stars such as these are willing to push the pop dance moves and rap solos to the side in order to accomplish the real purpose of country music.While many followers of the genre are growing to love the new direction that country music is heading towards, even more of them are wishing that it were going the other way. When fans turn their radios to their local country station, they are not expecting rap and rock music with seductive music to blast through the stereos. Singers and groups that stick to their roots give the more traditional country fans hope for a better tomorrow full of songs about sweet tea, peaches and country love.—Ashley Harter is a sophomore from Canton majoring in English","Ashley Harter

28-Apr-14,Oglethorpe Dining Commons health score drops seven points,"In an inspection that lasted nearly four hours on April 17, the University of Georgia’s Oglethorpe Dining Commons received a score of 80.“I heard the score, and I was alarmed. Our standard is to be above 90,” said Jeanne Fry, executive director of UGA Food Services.Fry said when she heard about the score, she canceled a two-day meeting and went directly to the dining commons.


 


“When I got there, I kind of toned down after I saw the inspection,” Fry said. “Yes it was an 80, but there was a lot of subjective marking-off that we received.”The biggest deduction was nine points for a broken temperature control on the frozen yogurt machine, which has since been removed from the dining hall. The machine has also been added to the temperature check logs.“There was no indication from that machine that it was malfunctioning,” said Bryan Varin, associate director of meal plan operations. “There was no warning sign.”Fry said the machine was still dispensing “frozen and good and delicious” yogurt despite the machine’s inability to hold the exact temperature.“We took that as a learning experience,” Varin said.Four more points were deducted for not having an extra sign indicating that sushi may contain raw fish. Fry said she felt this was “quite subjective.”“They inspected before 4 p.m., so sushi was not even present or being served,” Fry said. “We already have the labeling up there that cautions people about eating raw or undercooked food.”Additional points were lost for having grease on the floor at the Oriental Trading Market, where Fry said cooks are always “in rapid production.”


 


The dining commons also lost points for having sealed concrete, rather than linoleum or tile, flooring in a storeroom for tables.Fry said the storeroom flooring had remained the same since O-House was first built and had never before been considered in violation of health codes.“I’m not excusing things that we could have done better, but again there was a lot more subjective items in here,” Fry said. “We have addressed all issues just like we did at the [Village Summit Dining Commons] and put an action plan in.”Fry said O-House deserved to lose points for placing an ice shovel on top of an ice machine instead of on its proper hook on the machine’s side.“We should have gotten marked off for that, and appropriate counseling, retraining and discipline has occurred to the employees involved in that,” Fry said. “We are all about correcting wrong behaviors if we’re missing things.”Food Services employees will be trained, retrained and subjected to more frequent mock inspections going forward, Fry said. The health inspectors are expected to return “any day now” to check on the critical violations from the April 17 inspection, Varin said.Bailey Sumner, a freshman journalism major from Atlanta said she did not feel good about the score.“I think dining halls should have high scores because that’s their job. That’s this University’s job,” she said.

Varin said the staff takes these issues “very seriously” and works to correct any violations against health codes.“They try very hard,” he said. “It’s very important to all of us, from managers all the way down to full-time employees and student employees, too. We try to be very proactive.”The previous two scores for O-House were 87 in September 2013 and 91 in January 2013. Of the other UGA dining halls, Snelling Dining Commons and Bolton Dining Commons have scores of 100, followed by the Niche at Scott Hall at 96 and the Summit at 78.",Leighton Rowell @lmrow,uganews,https://www.redandblack.com/uganews/campus/oglethorpe-dining-commons-health-score-drops-seven-points/article_e4732de8-ce56-11e3-b9b8-0017a43b2370.html
10-May-14,Power and pitching propels Georgia softball to SEC championship,"The No. 14/11 Georgia Bulldogs softball team’s (44-12,15-9) victory against Southeastern Conference regular-season champion No. 5/6 Alabama Crimson Tide (45-11, 19-5) followed a similar script to most of the Bulldogs victories on the year: timely home runs and great pitching.“I thought Chelsea [Wilkinson] was fantastic on the mound,” Georgia coach Lu Harris-Champer said. ""We had some clutch hitting with Newt [Alex Hugo]. Wow what a game.”Hugo smacked the go-ahead hit in the top of the seventh inning when she hit a two-run home run that put the Bulldogs up 5-3. The home run was Hugo’s 23rd on the season, putting her one behind the Georgia single-season record


 


“It felt good coming off the bat, but I was unsure if it was home run,” said Hugo, who finished the game going 2-for-3 with a walk in addition to the home run. “I saw it hit off the netting and was unsure if was a home run, but then I saw [the ump] and he said it was good.”Wilkinson came in the second inning and pitched the final 5.2 innings to pick up 28th win of the year. Wilkinson gave up one run on four hits while striking out five Alabama batters.Wilkinson retired the first ten batters she faced before giving up a hit in the bottom of the sixth.“I just approach every batter one pitch at a time,” Wilkinson said.When Wilkinson was asked if she would be ready to pitch in Saturday's game - she also pitched a complete-game shutout against Florida on Thursday - Wilkinson responded, in the affirmative.“I’m ready,"" Wilkinson said. ""We are wanting to win a championship, and that is what we came here to do.”Georgia took a 2-0 lead in the top of the first inning when Wilson scored on a fielders choice, and Hugo was able to score on an Anna Swafford single.Alabama tied the game in the bottom of the first inning, when Jadyn Spencer hit a two-run home run.The Bulldogs starting pitcher Geri Ann Glasco would continue to struggle in the second inning when two of the first three batters knocked base hits. With one out in the second, Harris-Champer made the switch to Wilkinson, who got out of the jam.Georgia added a run in the top of the third to take a 3-2 lead, and Alabama responded in the bottom of the sixth when Kallie Case scored on a sac-fly.


 


Glasco, who moved to first when she was replaced by Wilkinson, led off the seventh inning with a double, setting up Hugo’s home run. The home run was the first of the tournament for the Bulldogs, who hit 80 as a team coming into the tournament.Georgia will take on the No.15/16 Kentucky Wildcats in the SEC tournament final on, May 10, at 8 p.m. This will be the Bulldogs fifth time playing for the championship, and would the school's first victory. The Bulldogs beat the Wildcats three consecutive times last weekend in Athens, Ga.

13-May-14,Georgia pitcher wins NFCA player of the week for second-straight week,"Georgia softball's sophomore pitcher Chelsea Wilkinson was named the Louisville Slugger/NFCA Division I National Player of the Week for her performance at the Southeastern Conference tournament. Wilkinson won the award last week, and became the first player this year to win the award in back-to-back weeks.Wilkinson, who is originally from Taylorsville, N.C., is the first Georgia player to earn this honor twice in the same season.After earning the NFCA weekly honor for her performance against No. 15 Kentucky, Wilkinson continued her recent success by earning the win in all three of Georgia's games in the SEC tournament. Wilkinson was named the SEC tournament's most valuable player. In addition to her three victories over No. 5 Florida, No. 6 Alabama and Kentucky, Wilkinson posted a 1.07 ERA and with 23 strikeouts in 19.2 innings of work.


 


Wilkinson was also named to the First Team All-SEC last week for her excellence on the season. Wilkinson went 29-7 record with a 2.04 ERA, six complete-game shutouts, 23 complete games and 257 strikeouts in 219.1 innings pitched. Wilkinson pitched well enough to lead the SEC in in wins, innings pitched and strikeouts.Wilkinson and the Georgia softball team earned the fourth-overall seed for the NCAA championships. The Bulldogs will be hosting the Athens Regional from May 16-18. The Bulldogs will host NC State, UAB and Chattanooga in a double-elimination format with the winner moving on to the Super Regionals.The Bulldogs' first game will be against Chattanooga on Saturday May 16 at 5:30 at Jack Turner Stadium.",Connor Riley,sports,https://www.redandblack.com/sports/georgia-pitcher-wins-nfca-player-of-the-week-for-second/article_73a83aea-dac7-11e3-862f-001a4bcf6878.html
18-May-14,Georgia softball splits two games Saturday in NCAA regionals,"The No.4 Georgia softball team wasn’t supposed to play two games on Saturday.The Bulldogs (47-13, 15-9) dropped their first game Saturday against the NC State Wolfpack (36-16, 16-8), a team they had beaten earlier in the year by the score of 5-4.Facing elimination in their second game of the day against the University of Alabama-Birmingham Blazers (32-27, 15-8), a team they had also beaten earlier in the year, rode their ace Chelsea Wilkinson to a 3-0 victory.


 


“You can’t say enough about Chelsea,” Georgia coach Lu Harris-Champer said. “I thought she was phenomenal on the mound and really led our team. I was so proud of her performance.”The win over the Blazers was also the 800th win in school history.The Bulldogs lost a tightly-contested first game against NC State, due in large part to the fact that they left 13 runners on base. The Bulldogs were able to draw 11 walks as a team but combined for only six hits.Harris-Champer said she felt that the biggest reason the Bulldogs lost the first game was their inability to drive home base-runners.“We had so many opportunities put runs across the broad,” Harris-Champer said. “That will be our goal next time, to put runs on the board when we have chances.”“I think a lot of those walks were situational,” said NC State coach Shawn Rychcik of his the 11 free passes his pitcher Emily Weiman issued. “We picked our poison with that lineup. A lot of times that put people on base but we felt confident so we could get some out and we did.”The two teams traded runs throughout the game but NC State was able to score three runs in the last two innings to push the lead to 5-2. A seventh inning comeback came up just short for the Bulldogs as they only drove in two runs before Weiman ended the game.Weiman pitched a complete game and struck out five while only giving up six hits and four runs in addition to the 11 walks. The win was her 30th on the season.


 


Wilkinson did pitch well in the first game, including striking out seven batters in the first three innings, but she did struggle at times, giving up two solo home runs and five earned runs for the game.Junior Paige Wilson led the Bulldogs offensively in the first game by having four hits and an RBI. Alex Hugo, Tina Iosefa and Anna Swafford each had three walks each.With the second game of the day beginning only a couple of hours after the loss the Bulldogs knew they would have to rebound quickly if they wanted another chance at NC State and advancing to the Super Regionals.Wilkinson would tie a career-high with 14 strikeouts against the Blazers and would pick up her 31st win of the season by allowing only three hits and two walks. The win improved her record to 31-8 on the year.Wilkinson moved into second place for single-season strikeouts with 284 and single season wins with 31.“We were just going out there fighting,” Wilkinson said of the second game. “We know that if we lose we will go home.”The Bulldogs scored their only runs of the game on a solo home run from Swafford in the second inning and three innings later when Paige Wilson hit a two-run home run to give the Bulldogs a 3-0 lead.The Bulldogs only registered four hits for the game as UAB senior Leigh Streetman kept the Bulldogs in check for most of the game. Streetman did take the loss but only surrendered those three runs and four hits in 6.1 innings while striking out three.

“I'm proud of them and I'm proud of the fight that they brought this week,” UAB head coach Maria Townsend said.The Bulldogs will need to beat the Wolfpack twice on Sunday if they are going to advance to the Super Regionals. The Bulldogs and Wolfpack are expected to play at noon at Jack Turner Stadium but weather could become an issue. Should the Bulldogs win, they would play the Wolfpack at approximately 2:30 weather permitting.“We are going to come out ready to fight and ready to compete,” Wilkinson said. “We know we have to win the first game to win the second.

5-Jun-14,UGA's on-campus threat security backed by years of preparation,"The shooting in Santa Barbara by Elliot Rodger in May left a college town shaken, disturbed a nation and took social media by storm.The Huffington Post reported 27 shootings occurred on college campuses in 2013 alone, where suspects left 18 people dead and even more injured.With headlines of school shootings plastered all over online and print news outlets, the clock seems to be ticking until the University of Georgia faces a similar threat.


 


But the UGA police department, Office of Emergency Preparedness and other departments work to secure the campus for its students, faculty, staff and guests every day with several initiatives and courses designed to ensure security on campus.Since the shooting at Virginia Tech in 2007, the OEP has collaborated with the UGA and Athens-Clarke County police departments to ensure a quick response to an active shooter.“We found training for the active shooter does a really good job of integrating the police forces and getting them familiar with each other and familiar with different buildings on and off campus,” said OEP director Steve Harris.UGA police’s training program is a “department-wide” program for all officers, said Lt. Eric Dellinger.“Obviously, we don’t have any idea who would be working when a something like that occurs — that training is for all our law enforcement personnel,” he said.The OEP also sends out UGA Alerts via phone calls, text messages and computer alerts, reaching devices within a minute or so of sending the alerts, Harris said.He said the OEP sends alerts concerning such potential threats as the case in 2009, when George Zinkhan, a former professor, took the lives of three others outside the Athens Community Theater before killing himself — the closest instance to an active shooter threat for UGA in recent history.“We did not know where he was going to go, considering he had one or two offices on campus,” Harris said. “We sent out an alert message about him, and we took his name off the alert so we wouldn’t let him know the heat was on.”


 


But the arm of the law can only reach so far, and Harris said many people must take personal responsibility in the event of an active shooter on campus.“This is a full police department with very professionally-trained officers,” he said. “But they can’t be everywhere, and they have a good response time on campus, so there’s some things you can do about being proactive.”A detailed list of active shooter response options is on the OED’s website at prepare.uga.edu.Students, faculty and staff can also take a voluntary class with details on past incidents around the nation and what personal responsibilities people have if an incident happens at UGA.Criminal MindsDuring the “Plan, Prepare, React” active shooter response class on Tuesday, Harris discussed the tendencies and habits of past shooters with data backed by an FBI study that looked at 154 active shooter cases between 2002 and 2012.No set of qualities or characteristics define a potential shooter.“There’s no true profile of an active shooter,” he said. “There have been studies, but there’s no true profile that definitively says ‘a shooter is this and this and this.’”


TNCMS.AdManager.render({region: 'fixed-big-ad-bottom-asset', slot: 1, fold: ""below""});


But many shooters tend to share qualities, including the habit of planning the event.“Most of them are methodically planned, and they have blueprints or floor plans,” Harris said.Many of the shooters also looked at past events as a target goal.“That whole feeling of ‘I want to up the Columbine kids and kill more people,’ and there are websites out there that promote that,” Harris said. “They have access to the body counts of incidents all over the world.”A key component of active shooter situations is the limited amount of time before police are notified - the average active shooter case takes between six and 12 minutes, Harris said.“The mentality of an active shooter, as the research shows, is ‘shoot, move, shoot, move,’ so they’re going to try to access wherever they can to get their targets,” he said.Low frequency, high impactBut a campus shooter, though a serious issue to Harris, is not what “keeps [him] up worrying at night,” he said.

“An active shooter is a low-frequency event, but it’s a high-impact event if it happens,” he said.Harris said the issue does cause devastation, but the media tends to exaggerate the rate of incidents that occur on college campuses.“I think the media covers these events very closely,” he said. “Potentially, it makes you think it happens more than it does. We don’t think it would never happen - it could - but as far as historically, the chance of it happening is low. I try to focus on things that have happened here, like severe weather or chemical spills.”Cicely Robinson-Jones, business manager for the Institute for Women’s Studies, said a class on active shooters for certain faculty and staff would be helpful, despite the low rate.“I think it would be good if it was still voluntary but maybe if someone stopped by and talked with the office manager and the director of each department because those are the two people usually in charge of the operations,” she said.Training for employees in major students hubs, including dining halls, libraries and students centers, would contribute to security on campus, said Britney Singer, a manager at the Oglethorpe House Dining Commons.“We have thousands of students coming through our doors every day, so it would be good to have a plan,” she said.",Brad Mannion @bradcrumbs,uganews,https://www.redandblack.com/uganews/campus/uga-s-on-campus-threat-security-backed-by-years-of/article_eb57d564-ec47-11e3-b79e-0017a43b2370.html
11-Jun-14,Six entering auto crimes reported in three days,"Athens-Clarke County police received six separate entering auto reports between June 5 and June 7.Three of the incidents occurred on South Poplar Street in Athens’ East Side.A 21-year-old UGA student reported to ACC police that his unlocked car was allegedly entered while parked on South Poplar Street overnight between 7 p.m. on June 5 and 7 a.m. on June 6. The victim told police that an iPod Touch, an iPod and a Sony digital camera were stolen from his vehicle. He also stated that two pharmacy receipts, belonging neither to him nor to his roommate, were left on the ground in front of his vehicle. Police processed the car for fingerprints and took the receipts into evidence.


 


In a related case, another 21-year-old UGA student reported to ACC police that his car was also entered while parked near the same South Poplar Street residence between 7 p.m. on June 5 to 7 a.m. on June 6. The victim told police no items were missing from his vehicle.Police responded to a third report of entering auto on South Poplar Street on June 7.

12-Jun-14,UGA worked to reduce carbon emissions before EPA plan,"Georgia Power’s carbon dioxide emissions reached more than 22 million metric tons in 2013, guaranteeing its first place spot in the country for most emissions that year, according to the Wall Street Journal.But long before the report, the University of Georgia worked to reduce that number and implement a cleaner, more efficient energy source.Ralph Johnson, associate vice president for facility management, said UGA is conducting a study to determine the best course of action to replace the school’s coal boiler with a different energy source. The study, which began in March 2013, will conclude this summer, but the steps to replace the boiler takes much longer.


 


“That’s years away because of the time frame to replace something of this scale,” he said. “You have to come up with the funding, and it requires significant permitting with the [Environmental Protection Division].”UGA has made changes to the coal boiler since its construction in 1945. These changes were in response to policies instilled by the EPD.“We weren’t under the same environmental regulations we are now,” Johnson said. “We have added numerous controls. A lot of new technology added to the boiler from its original construction has made it more efficient and so that it discharges less in the air.”Despite this “new technology,” Johnson said UGA looks ahead to different forms of fuel that can meet the demand of the school.“Whether that means burning natural gas, burning biomass or any other types of technology, that’s what the evaluation process is doing,” he said. “It’s about what makes the most sense for the scale of what we need to produce steam for the campus. We have to keep in mind we’re required to produce steam 24 hours a day, seven days a week to support the campus, so whatever fuel source we choose needs to be reliable and available.”Johnson said possible alternatives to coal include biomass and natural gas, paying attention to“We’re also looking, obviously, at the economics of those fuels,” he said.Where UGA can only go so far, the federal government stepped in to implement a coal regulation rule to cut down on carbon emissions in Georgia, a plan loved and loathed by Georgians.


 


The plan, according to an Environmental Protection Agency press release, would “cut carbon emission from the power sector by 30 percent nationwide below 2005 levels” and produce $93 billion in climate and public health benefits. The plan would also reduce electricity bills by eight percent.Georgia Public Service Commissioner Tim Echols was unable to be reached for comment on the plan, but John Kraft, spokesman for Georgia Power, spoke on the EPA’s overreaching.“EPA’s proposed emission guidelines appear to be based on reduction measures that extend well beyond Clean Air Act requirements and infringe upon states’ authority to determine the best approach for their own generating sources,” he said in a Savannah Now news article.",Brad Mannion @bradcrumbs,uganews,https://www.redandblack.com/uganews/uga-worked-to-reduce-carbon-emissions-before-epa-plan/article_f0f64138-f1ef-11e3-9558-0017a43b2370.html
18-Jun-14,Tight end Hunter Atkinson elects not to join team for the fall,"Georgia football class of 2014 tight end signee Hunter Atkinson announced Wednesday that he will not be playing for the team come fall.“Georgia is a great school with both athletic and academic opportunities and I want to thank coach Richt and the other coaches for their interest and all they have done for me over the past few months,” Atkinson said.  “I realized I have other career goals and want to pursue those interests.”Atkinson, a 6-foot-6 three-star prospect out of West Hall High School, surprised many when he signed with Georgia on National Signing Day as he had not previously been too connected with the team.


 


Losing Atkinson comes at a precarious time for the Georgia tight end corps, as only one player on the Georgia roster has legitimate tight end experience in junior Jay Rome. The tight end position is filled out by former fullback Quayvon Hicks and rising freshman and fellow class of 2014 signee Jeb Blazevich.

21-Jun-14,New Bolton dining hall on schedule to open for fall,"Students can expect an open and fully operational Bolton Dining Commons on the first day of Fall 2014 classes for the University of Georgia.Construction on Bolton began in January 2013, with the final stages of construction set for completion this summer.""I think students are absolutely gonna love this facility,"" said Jeanne Fry, Executive Director of Food Services. 


 


Bolton will host a series of small and large soft openings in order to work on the new dining hall's logistics.UGA will demolish the old Bolton and construct a parking lot in its place, Fry said.The new two-story Bolton can seat over 1000 patrons. The first floor contains around 350 seats. Traditional tables and chairs, booths, and seating on the outside balconies make up the roughly 650 seats on the second floor.Patrons can enter the building from either the entrance on Baxter Street or from another entrance on the Tanyard Creek side. Each entrance has its own set of turnstiles. Patrons may take food from the first floor to the second floor and vise versa. Each floor has a separate dish room.Most of the staff will move from old Bolton to new Bolton and the new dining hall will need significantly more workers because of the increased size and scope.""There will be more employees because of the complexity of the stations, the physical size of the building, and because of Sunday Dinner,"" Fry said.New Bolton has operating hours different from any of the other dining halls. Food services decided that New Bolton will close early on Fridays at 2:30 p.m. and will reopen on Sunday from 2:30 p.m. to 8:00 p.m. for dinner. Fry explained that closing early on Friday allows for Sunday Dinner without an increase in meal plan price.Bolton will have regular 7:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m. hours Monday through Thursday and it will close on Saturday. New Bolton is the only UGA dining hall that offers a Sunday dinner.


 


Patrons who enter from the Baxter Street entrance will immediately see the bakeshop called The Baxter Street Bakery. The bakery will serve numerous dessert options and all of the baked goods served in the new Bolton will be baked there.Upon entering through the Tanyard Creek side, patrons will see the Corner Market, a new version of the salad bar that many students enjoyed at the old Bolton. Fry said, ""The Bolton salad bar has always been big on choices and we certainly wanted to capture that again."" The Corner Market will also offer vegan and vegetarian options.Also on the first floor is a station made up of three sections called the Bolton Bistro. The first section, Classic Cuisine, serves a three-week cycle menu with traditional food like meatloaf, mashed potatoes, and fried chicken. The second section, Hickory and Oak, will offer smoked meat and barbecue sides for dinner and rotisserie chicken for lunch. The third part of Classic Cuisine offers a food concept new to food services.""Our dietary team has worked on recipes and selections that will be free of the big 8 allergens,"" Fry said.According to the FDA, the big 8 allergens are milk, eggs, fish, crustacean shellfish, tree nuts, peanuts, wheat, and soybeans.On the second floor patrons can enjoy breakfast all day long at the Sunrise Café, more traditional fare like burgers and fries at the Tanyard Grill, or made-to-order sandwiches at the Tanyard Deli. Worlds Fare will offer a series of concepts with an international flair.Allison Harper, food services marketing coordinator, explained that each station in the Worlds Fare has a name that means restaurant, or a close translation, in another language.Canting will serve a variety of Asian options, Trattoria will serve made to order sautéed pasta, and Taqueria will mostly serve Mexican and fresh hot wings.

Behind the grill patrons will find a station boasting a retro 50s style design called Shakes. Shakes will serve hand-spun milkshakes. Food Services has used the milkshakes as a selling point for the new Bolton.Incoming freshman have had a taste of the milkshakes at Orientation.""We're giving out samples of the milkshakes for new students who are coming in,"" Harper said. ""Our current meal plan customers were able to get a taste before they left in the spring.""Students that have not registered for a meal plan can also enjoy the new Bolton facility. Any students may use the restrooms on the first floor located outside of the turnstiles.The first floor also includes a lounge room open to all students. The room, called The Hearth, contains approximately 120 seats and several fireplaces.Bolton will not open for Sunday dinner until the first Sunday after classes begin.Food services expects an overwhelming number of patrons in the first few days after new Bolton opens.""It's going to be overwhelming at the beginning just because it's new,"" Fry said. ""The crowd will likely die down after a few weeks of operation.""",Gil Golan @gill_c_golan,uganews,https://www.redandblack.com/uganews/new-bolton-dining-hall-on-schedule-to-open-for-fall/article_04eb513e-f9ba-11e3-a2f3-0017a43b2370.html

2-Jul-14,Scouting Report - Sage Hardin,"A three-star offensive tackle from The Marist School in Atlanta, Sage Hardin became the 13th recruit to commit to the University of Georgia football team for the class of 2015 on June 27. A big and strong run blocker, Hardin uses his quick feet and tenacious attitude to finish a large proportion of his blocks on the ground. Fundamentally raw, however, Hardin needs to work on refining his positioning, flexibility and his pass-blocking technique in order to be more successful.Strengths: When watching Hardin on tape, the most striking of his qualities lie in the physical realm, but his most impressive trait might be how he uses his physical gifts. Measuring in at 6-foot-6 and 260 pounds, Hardin already possesses elite size for an offensive tackle without having benefited from a college weight training program. In spite of this, Hardin blocks with the intensity of a smaller player, finishing many of his blocks on the ground with his opponent. Hardin rarely stops his feet when he’s blocking, instead driving his feet through the defender en route to a pancake block. He has a quick first step that jolts him off the line before his opponents and creates a leverage advantage against an off-balance defender. In the pass game, Hardin also uses a combination of quick hands and strong balance to sit back in a pass, rarely allowing rushers to sneak by him.Weaknesses: Many of Hardin’s weaknesses seem to stem from a fundamental lack of flexibility. Hardin often blocks too high, sometimes standing straight up before hitting a defender. While his natural size and strength have helped him compensate for this issue, at the next level his lower body flexibility will need to improve. It can be seen in his feet from his stance that he lacks flexibility, as his heels are often angled high off the ground, pressing more weight on his hands. Symptomatically, Hardin employs a four-point stance –a stance with two hands on the ground rather than the conventional one – and generates a lot of his power from his upper body rather than his lower body. Furthermore, this flaw often pushes his helmet out in front of his toes when he’s run blocking. This overextends Hardin’s frame and makes it harder for him to keep his balance, meaning either he will fall down with the defender he is blocking or a skilled defender will use Hardin’s weight against him and bring him to the ground with one move. As a pass blocker, Hardin needs to learn to attack less often and let rushers come to him. Though in some situations he does this, there are times that Hardin fires out toward a defender on a pass play, leaving his forward momentum susceptible to being used against him.


 


Bottom Line: Hardin is a player it is hard not to like as an evaluator. Most of his flaws are technical and are results of both his relative inexperience and the winged-t offensive scheme he runs at Marist. Still with room to grow into his frame, Hardin is the kind of player who would likely benefit from a summer of strength and conditioning training on a college campus. Though it would be unlikely that Hardin would be ready to start as a true freshman in the Southeastern Conference, if he develops as he is capable of, Hardin is the kind of player who could compete for playing time after the graduation of junior offensive tackle John Theus. If in a worst-case scenario Hardin doesn’t develop as expected and remains the same size, he would likely bump inside to guard and play rotationally.",Nick Suss,sports,https://www.redandblack.com/sports/scouting-report---sage-hardin/article_13f55dd4-0223-11e4-95c1-0017a43b2370.html
7-Jul-14,Earth to Echo is fun but doesn't stand up to classics,"There is no denying it. Earth To Echo is an attempt to capture the purity and essence of films like E.T: the Extra Terrestrial and The Goonies for this generation of kids. Like J.J Abrams’ Super 8, the essence of Spielberg’s tales of the 80’s and 90’s are plastered all over this film. This should be a bad thing, as a tale as classic and essential as this one should be protected and isolated, however; it passes the censor as a fun kids film that is a great time for both the kids looking for it and the parents having to tag along with them.We have all seen films like this: a group of kids on the path of discovery with a sleazy government agency on their tail trying to apprehend them. The tropes are all present: the comic relief, the tough loner, and the lead with a love interest that is out of his league and will inevitably fall for him. Adventure, suspense, teen angst, and a great story of friendship are in store.I would usually warn against a film that is so similar to something superior, but Earth to Echo gives a peculiar feel that was very inviting and enjoyable. The kids, despite their kindergarten levels of tame dialogue, had that Goonie level drive to save their town that made me want to follow them on the journey and truly believe in what they are doing despite the overwhelming odds set against them.


 


However, there is a reason it does not stand up to the classics.There is absolutely no reason that this should have been a found footage film. It is a gimmick that is not followed to best of its ability and even falls short on the logic at which the gimmick could have been executed. If the alien could only see through one of the kids cell phones for most of the story, why not just make the alien only be able to see through the camera? This would make it plausible that the kids would need to have the camera on the whole time during the film instead of it being there just for the sake of the story.When a scene is tense and one of the kids inevitably drops the camera, why would the kid come back for it? Why not leave it behind like anyone else in a life or death situation? This is a question audiences have been asking since the start of this genre.That is really the only complaint. The kids have a long way to go before they can prove themselves as formidable actors, but judging the kids in a genre defined by them is a little shameful. It is a fun film that can be enjoyed by anyone who is looking for a good time with the kids.","Marshall Jenkins

10-Jul-14,Column: Georgia football ticket resale prices unjustifiably highest in SEC,"Suppose you saved one dollar every day for a year. There would be plenty of things you could do with the money: You could invest it, you could buy yourself something nice, you could donate it to a charity.Or, you could buy a secondary general admission ticket to see Georgia play Clemson.At an average price of $359.26, buying a secondary ticket to see the Bulldogs’ home opener is no easy fare. And while fans can take a solace in the fact that that price is more than 50 percent more expensive than a ticket to an average home game, that still leaves the average home game resale price at $227.01.


 


According to a recent study done by Forbes, Georgia boasts the highest football home game resale ticket prices of any school in the Southeastern Conference, and by a wide margin. Georgia is the only school that has an average resale price above $200, with the next closest school almost $50 cheaper.Though it can be argued that the prices are set at market value–people still come week after week and almost always fill the stadium for SEC or major conference matchups – the main question to be asked is can this high price be justified? While the team has consistently been a factor in college football over the past decade, practically no one would argue that Georgia has dominated the SEC.The Bulldogs haven’t won the conference since 2005 and, as is well-documented by now, four different conference foes claimed seven national titles in the period since then.But team success doesn’t necessarily define what causes the prices of tickets to be high or low. The problem is, it is hard to define exactly what does.The first criteria one would probably look at is the quality of games played in the home stadium itself. It would be logical to assume a correlation exists between how good a team’s opponents are and how many tickets are sold. But when looking at that relationship, Georgia still doesn’t stand out against the pack.The Bulldogs welcomed a total of seven teams that finished in the postseason top 25 to Sanford Stadium since 2009, a total that when compared against the SEC’s most dominant teams of the past half-decade–Alabama, LSU, Auburn, Florida and South Carolina–ties the team for last in quality home games.However, the difference between Georgia’s low total of seven and Auburn’s high total of 10 comes out to just three-fifths of a ranked home game more per season. Though this difference might be sizeable in the eyes of voters and in strength-of-schedule, it would likely not be a deterrent for ticket prices.So another criteria to examine might be the quality of the games themselves. Perhaps the question of why ticket prices are so high shouldn’t be determined by who you play, but by how well the games are played.


 


By comparing the score differential in FBS home games over the same period for these same six schools, Georgia is neither the most likely to blow a team out or be blown out, nor is it the most likely to play close games.The average margin of victory in for the winner of an FBS game played in Sanford Stadium since 2009 is 19.68 points, a number made smaller by the outlier season that was 2009 when the average margin of victory was just 5.6 points. By comparison, the average margin of victory in games played by Alabama in Tuscaloosa since 2009 is 22.69 points and the margin in games played by South Carolina in Columbia is 17.23 points.If fans are more likely to want to see games decided in the final minutes, Georgia is a good destination, but not the best. While the Bulldogs’ total of 10 home games decided by one score or less is impressive, it is unsurprising that Auburn has a larger total, as 14 such games have been hosted at Jordan-Hare Stadium in this timeframe.Even when extending the margin of victory to two scores, Georgia can’t compare to Auburn, as Georgia’s mark of 14 is still dwarfed by Auburn’s mark of 18.But perhaps to travel to a stadium isn’t spurned by what happens on the field, but by the stadium itself.In that case, it would be logical to think that the main contributing factors in this scenario would be stadium size and stadium atmosphere.Size works against the Bulldogs in this case.Sanford Stadium is the fourth-largest stadium in the SEC, making it seem infeasible that tickets would be sparse.


TNCMS.AdManager.render({region: 'fixed-big-ad-bottom-asset', slot: 1, fold: ""below""});


With only nine stadiums in college football fitting a larger capacity, the argument that prices are so high because there aren’t enough seats could be made due to Georgia’s ravenous fan base, but likely shouldn’t.If that argument is made so too should it be made that schools like Texas A&M and Alabama should raise their prices.This leaves atmosphere as the final factor to be examined.Sanford Stadium is consistently ranked one of the most scenic stadiums in the country and the fan atmosphere and number of traditions makes the stadium more than just a field on which to play football.But when experts were asked to rank the best stadium experiences in college football, Sanford still came up shorter than the stadiums of some conference opponents.In an Athlon Sports poll made up of college football insiders and analysts, Sanford Stadium was ranked as the eighth-best stadium in college football, once again trailing four SEC schools.In another Athlon Sports poll conducted exclusively with SEC insiders, Sanford Stadium was rated as the third-best stadium in the conference, trailing LSU's Tiger Stadium in Baton Rouge, the stadium which was honored as the best in the country in the former poll, and Texas A&M's Kyle Field in College Station.All of this data supports the same notion: Although tickets to be admitted into Sanford Stadium shouldn’t come cheap, they obviously shouldn’t be the highest in the conference either when considering tangible factors.

But perhaps that is a compliment to Georgia fans themselves. If the value is this high to get into the game secondarily, there must be something more than just the tangible factors of the games that drives fans to the games.Regardless of whether the factors are tangible or intangible though, one thing is for certain: you better start saving money if you want to get into a Georgia home game this season. Correction: The original printing of the story omitted the word ""secondary"" from the phrase ""secondary ticket sales."" Georgia has the highest secondary ticket prices in the SEC, not the highest ticket prices.",Nick Suss,sports,https://www.redandblack.com/sports/column-georgia-football-ticket-resale-prices-unjustifiably-highest-in-sec/article_88e64fd6-0840-11e4-b825-0017a43b2370.html
11-Jul-14,Michael Phelps and Ryan Lochte headline the field at the Bulldog Grand Slam,"The opening of a single door made an entire crowd fall silent with anticipation. A figure emerged who provoked a rush of young girls wielding smartphones and tablets to gleefully scream and run, trying to snap even a single photograph. Everybody’s eyes immediately shot to the center of the room.Michael Phelps had walked onto the deck.Fresh out of retirement, swimming’s biggest star headlines the field at this weekend’s Bulldog Grand Slam swim event held at the Gabrielsen Natatorium in Athens, a field that also contains Olympic medalists Ryan Lochte and Allison Schmitt as well as 27 active Georgia Bulldogs swimmers.


 


All eyes will be on Phelps and Lochte this weekend, as both of the competitors are using this meet as a rehab event of sorts, Phelps still training his way back out of retirement and Lochte recovering from a knee injury that has kept him out of every recent event but one.“This meet is exactly like guys like Ryan and the first class swimmers needed, a chance to swim in a facility like this being run by coaches,” Lochte’s coach David Marsh said. “If we weren’t here, we’d be at a meet where there were three-times as many people in the competition, so to get a chance to race in a real focused meet, it’ll help these guys get focused and for now when we’re out [at the U.S. Championships] in Irvine and kind of a lot is on the line then.”For Lochte, this meet is even more of a warm-up then Marsh insinuated.“Honestly, I hope I don’t win,” Lochte said. “I say that because it would make me mad. Of course I love winning, but at the same time I’m taking away from this meet, I’m getting on those blocks and seeing how far I can push my knee if I’m there.”Though Lochte said he would still try to win, his comments were unsurprising to many, as the prevailing notion is that he shouldn’t push his injured knee too hard before national and international competition begins.One such person who expressed this notion was Bob Bowman, coach of the North Baltimore Aquatic Club and Phelps’ longtime coach. Bowman said that Lochte needs to be careful of not “pushing down on the gas too hard,” adding that he should save his energy knowing that he’ll be needed in the future.But Bowman also said that Phelps would never think that way.After his 20-month hiatus, Phelps has been training to get back into the shape that won him a record eight gold medals at the 2008 Olympics in Beijing. And although Bowman said Phelps did underestimate how difficult it would be to get back in shape, he is pleased with the results Phelps has posted since his return.


 


“He’s done pretty well and I always like for him to have done more, but for what he’s done, he’s done quite well,” Bowman said.For those closest to Phelps, seeing him back in the water has brought back memories of the vintage Phelps.North Baltimore Aquatic Club teammate and Georgia swimmer Chase Kalisz has known Phelps since for years, saying that Phelps has always been “like an older brother” to him. Kalisz was the first to point out that though his priorities have changed, Phelps is still just as competitive as he ever was.“Obviously, he has different goals,” Kalisz said. “Going in from 2004, he went in with the mindset of winning eight gold medals. Preparing for that and he did it. For anyone, how do you top that: eight gold medals and seven world records? I guess eight world records? So obviously 2012 was different for him. He had a different goal then and he has a different goal now.”Whatever Phelps’ goals are, Bowman said that this meet is exactly what Phelps needed in his training process: an intermediate Grand Prix event to compete in before nationals. Lochte and Marsh reciprocated that notion, indicating that this event will be instrumental in his recovery process.But for Lochte, this event is something of a homecoming as well. An alumnus of the University of Florida, Lochte last swam in Athens back in 2003 at that year’s NCAA swim tournament, an event he won.Despite having attended a rival school, Lochte said he holds no hostility toward the University of Georgia, saying that college was “a long time ago.” In fact, Lochte has nothing but kind words for Athens and the pool at the Gabrielsen Natatorium itself.“I love this pool, I love the facility, the atmosphere,” Lochte said. “I’m really looking forward to start racing.”

11-Jul-14,Culture Talk: Arab Cultural Association shares ‘hospitable’ environment with UGA,"Despite its short existence, the Arab Cultural Association has made its mark at the University of Georgia.The group began in 2011, and has since increased to an approximately 40-member organization, said ACA President Didi Abdulnabi.As the second president of the organization, Abdulnabi said she joined the group for the experience of being a part of an Arab cultural group.


 


“I myself am Arab, so it was a good place for me to be,” she said. “I had never been a part of an actual Arab community, so it was nice to be a part of it.”Abdulnabi said she and other ACA members, though half are only of Arab descent, embrace the culture with various events throughout the school year.Many of the events include traditional Mediterranean foods associated with the Arab culture.“We host a coffee hour once a year. We’ll have some pita bread and other things, and for dessert, we’ll have baklava,” she said. “We even did a hookah night some time this year, and people really liked that.”The ACA also presented its first Middle-Terranean Night in the spring of 2014. The Morton Theatre hosted the event, where tickets were $8 for UGA students and $10 for non-students. The ACA hosted Arab Night in 2013, which involved a collaboration of several schools, including UGA, Emory University and Georgia State University, said former president Dalal Hillou.The four-year-old group is new to hosting such major events, but the ACA has already received recognition for its work. During the 2013-2014 school year, the ACA received the Cultural Collaboration Award at the International Student Life banquet.The ACA is involved in fundraisers, monthly events, biweekly meetings and the yearly International Street Fest, but Abdulnabi said membership is as simple as attending meetings and expressing interest in being involved.“Our membership is really whoever wants to show up, we usually have the same people, but if you want to be in it, you’re basically in it,” she said.


 


As founder and the group’s first president, Dalal Hillou said the group aims to focus on providing an organization for students of Arab descent to embrace their roots and to demonstrate the kind nature of Arab culture.“The Arab people are very hospitable,” she said. “We do our best to welcome people who are either a part of the culture or interested of learning about our culture. We tend to be very respective and welcoming. To me, that's the most important thing.”",Brad Mannion @bradcrumbs,uganews,https://www.redandblack.com/uganews/culture-talk-arab-cultural-association-shares-hospitable-environment-with-uga/article_49f884c6-09f6-11e4-9851-0017a43b2370.html
15-Jul-14,SEC Media Days: Steve Spurrier's best one-liners from day two,"When it comes to the Southeastern Conference Media Days, South Carolina head coach Steve Spurrier's is always one of the more looked-forward-to press conferences.It’s not so much because Spurrier gives any extra insight into his football team or is particularly philosophical—he’s not. It’s those one-line Spurrier-isms that people want to hear, and his press conference on day two didn’t disappoint.Remember the Alamo


 


South Carolina opens up the 2014 season with Texas A&M, a rivalry game that will now be centered around the Alamo Trophy, which depicts Alamo hero and South Carolina graduate James Bonham on a horse.Spurrier didn’t exactly see it that way.“I’m actually from Tennessee, I always thought the hero of the Alamo was Davy Crockett, so this was a new one to me,” Spurrier said. “I’m sure Bonham did some good things. I always thought Davy Crockett was the hero of the Alamo, he and those 33 Tennessee guys that came in there and got killed, so forth.”This gives South Carolina a chance for a plethora of trophies during the season, including the Mayors’ Trophy between the Gamecocks and Missouri, both located in Columbia, and the Palmetto Bowl Trophy with Clemson. This might just be one too many trophies for the Old Ball Coach’s taste, though.“If they want to do it, that’s fine,” Spurrier said. “I just don’t know how many games you’re going to have a trophy for as you go through the season.”10 years and countingSpurrier now holds an SEC record for being the only SEC coach to coach at two schools for 10 or more years. This gave Spurrier a good chance to look on the path that has brought him here.“Obviously you never know what your path in life is going to lead to,” Spurrier said. “When I left Florida after 12 years, I thought I was going to coach NFL five or six years and retire to the beach and play golf a bunch and travel around this, that and the other.”


 


That didn’t exactly work out.“But that was a bad plan,” Spurrier said. “It was. Later you found out, that was not a real good idea. But that’s the way I was thinking back then. After the two years with the team I was with, I said, ‘This isn’t for me.’”But of course, Spurrier had to end up at South Carolina one way or another, right?“Some people ask, ‘How did you end up there?’ I said, ‘I was available and they were the only ones who offered me a job,” Spurrier said. “I wanted to go out a winner, not a loser.”Spurrier’s Bahama vacationCollege football doesn’t have owners in the way an NFL franchise does, but it does have boosters. Spurrier gave his approval of this system.“The big donors in college are similar to like an owner in the NFL because they put the money up,” Spurrier said. “The best part of it, they don’t tell us what to do, though.”Spurrier takes his commitment to donors seriously, though. He hosts a dinner for them with his wife every year and believes it's his job as a coach to get to know them. That’s not to say, however, that Spurrier doesn’t get his fair share of benefits from the relationship with those well-off donors.

16-Jul-14,SEC Media Days: Frehsmen expected to shine on a rebuilt LSU team,"LSU and head coach Les Miles are almost always cycling through new talent after the roster is pillaged by the NFL Draft.At the Southeastern Conference Media Days, Miles was quick to point out that his team sees more early entrees into the Draft than any other team, which leaves him in a constant struggle to replace NFL-caliber talent.Despite this, LSU remains a perennial contender, a fact almost solely due to the team’s ability to bring in premier young talent out of high school.


 


“I think it’s the guys that we recruit,” senior tackle La’el Collins said. “The guys that we recruit, our coaches always do a great job with preparing the guys behind the first-string guys … I just feel that our coaches do a great job with us as far as preparing us for whatever so when we do lose a lot of guys to the NFL, all the younger guys are already developed.”Going into the 2014 season, the Tigers once against find themselves looking to replace several players including quarterback Zach Mettenberger, running back Jeremy Hill and receivers Odell Beckham and Jarvis Landry. This year, Miles will look upon a strong freshman class to fill those voids on offense.“We recruited the second nationally ranked team in the last year,” Miles said. “[Running back] Leonard Fournette and [wide receiver] Malachi Dupre, [linebacker] C.J. Garrett and [quarterback] Brandon Harris, to name four freshmen that we would expect to have great impact on our season.”Of those freshmen, Fournette probably has the highest ceiling. As a five-star prospect out of high school, Fournette has already begun to turn heads in his short time in Baton Rouge.“It didn’t take long at all. I’d probably say it took about seven seconds when I seen him [to catch my attention],” senior running back Terrence Magee said about Fournette. “Just the power and speed and the vision that he runs with. Most backs, they have three things that make them unique: vision, speed and power, and if you have all three then you’re really considered as a great back and I’m going to be honest with you, I only have two but when I see him run the ball and I watch him, he has a combination of all three. I think he’s going to be great.”But Fournette won’t be expected to carry the load in the LSU backfield immediately. Instead, he’ll have a chance to share carries with the likes of Magee and senior Kenny Hilliard as he learns the LSU offense.“As a running back, he’s got it all and I can’t wait until he’s able to really get loose and do everything he has the God-given talent to do,” Collins said. “I think he has…a better veteran group of running backs in front of him to learn from than anyone in the country … I think that all those guys is kind of in the mix and learning from each other, taking different little things from each other with the veteran guys leading the younger guys. I think we’re going to be good.”In contrast, Harris could easily become the guy with the largest load, but only if he wins the starting quarterback battle. He’s battling with Anthony Jennings, a sophomore who appears to have the upper hand in the battle currently based on how Miles and others spoke at Media Days. However, there is a lot of potential in Harris and he still has a legitimate shot to win the job.


 


“The key piece is he really throws the ball well. I mean, he is a guy that has real strength,” Miles said. “He's innately accurate. He's got great footwork. He can extend a play, get out of the pocket, move around. But probably the best thing about him is he anticipates that great play, too. He has the opportunity to see it and has the arm to get it there. There's some real advantages with him.”The final piece to the offensive puzzle is Dupre and fellow freshman receiver Trey Quinn, who will look to replace Beckham and Landry. That will be a tough task. The dynamic ability of both Beckham and Landry attributed greatly to the success of Mettenberger last season as well as the LSU team as a whole.Both freshmen have already impressed this summer and won’t be alone in getting the receptions this season, but they will have to be an integral part in filling a very athletic void left by Beckham and Landry.“Malachi Dupree and Trey Quinn, they’ve done a great job this summer,” Magee said. “They’ve shown consistency. They’ve done a great job of running routes and being real smooth. I think they’ll have an opportunity to come in and play a big role this year. Travin Dural, one of the leaders on the team, he’s done a great job of taking them under his wing and showing them the ropes so I think they’ll have a lot of opportunity to have a good year.”",Cody Pace,sports,https://www.redandblack.com/sports/sec-media-days-frehsmen-expected-to-shine-on-a-rebuilt/article_d2a95f6c-0d2e-11e4-a205-0017a43b2370.html
17-Jul-14,SEC Media Days: Depth at offensive skill positions will help Hutson Mason's development,"HOOVER, Alabama --- Last season, depth was at the center of the conversation about Georgia for all the wrong reasons after injuries depleted the team. This year, depth will once again be a focal point, but for a different reason.When Malcolm Mitchell, Justin Scott-Wesley and Michael Bennett went down at receiver last year, then-quarterback Aaron Murray had the likes of freshmen Reggie Davis and Kenneth Towns and little-played seniors Rhett McGowan and Rantavious Wooten to throw to — not exactly a premier group.Now Mitchell, Scott-Wesley and Bennett are all back on top of Chris Conley, Jonathan Rumph, Blake Tibbs and more experienced versions of Towns and Davis, all of whom will vie for receptions this season.


 


“It’s great, the fact that those guys are back and they’re running,” Conley said. “It’s a huge relief for me the fact that those guys have played in games, they’ve made plays, they’re people that the defense has to account for.”That receiver depth provides a couple of benefits to the team. The first is that it gives the team time to rehab Scott-Wesley and Mitchell, who are in the end stages of anterior cruciate ligament surgeries. This especially benefits Scott-Wesley, who had his surgery later in the season, and could allow him to rest a couple of games early in the season to help his longevity.“I think he might be available to play day one but I don’t know if he’ll be playing at a tempo and where we feel like he’s ready to do it at the highest level,” head coach Mark Richt said. “There’s a lot of competition at that position as well so I’m not 100 percent sure how long it’ll be before he gets in there and goes full speed.”The second benefit is that it gives quarterback Hutson Mason, who has just two starts under his belt, an experienced group of receivers to throw the ball to as he continues to adjust to being a starting quarterback.“Hutson needs to have the confidence in the people that he’s throwing to, every quarterback does,” Conley said. “The fact that Hutson’s working with new guys and some of these guys are working with Hutson for the first time, it’s important to build those relationships and build the continuity that they need to make the plays in the games.”It isn’t just depth at receiver that will help Mason, either. Georgia’s backfield was also depleted by a short injury to Todd Gurley and a season-ending injury to Keith Marshall. Now both players are back, along with Brendan Douglas, who saw a heavy load last season after the injuries, and highly-touted freshmen Nick Chubb and Sony Michel.The key to establishing true depth in the backfield is to have both freshmen ready to play this season. Neither were and early enrollees, meaning they’ve only been in Athens for a couple of months. However, Gurley said both are coming along well in the short amount of time.“I’ve been with those guys a lot, we do like seven-on-seven, just the players and stuff,” Gurley said. “Those guys now, they’re working and doing a lot of hard work. Those guys are cool guys, they definitely know way more stuff than I did when I came in. They definitely know a lot of stuff.”


 


The possibility of redshirting one or both players is still a possibility, however. The backfield would still retain its depth as long as Marshall’s ACL is 100 percent healthy, which it sounds like it is getting close to.“Keith looks great,” Richt said. I’ve watched him run straight ahead. He looks outstanding in that area. He is changing direction. I don’t know if I’d say he is 100 percent today but he has no limitations today in his training. He can run routes, he can do pass [skeleton], he can do anything. We think day one he’ll be 100 percent ready to compete.”If it stays healthy, this group will be able to take a heavy load of carries so the Georgia offense isn’t so dependent on the passing game like it was for parts of last season.",Cody Pace,sports,https://www.redandblack.com/sports/sec-media-days-depth-at-offensive-skill-positions-will-help/article_aca65960-0de1-11e4-b0ee-0017a43b2370.html
18-Jul-14,"Three UGA admins appointed, begin tenure during summer","Two vice presidential appointees have started their work for the 2014-2015 academic year at the University of Georgia, while the vice provost will begin his tenure later this summer.Kelly Kerner, vice president for development and alumni relations, left the same post at Bowdoin College in Brunswick, Maine, where he worked for two years.As of July 1st, Kerner has replaced the retired former vice president Tom Landrum, directly overseeing development, alumni relations, financial services, special events and the career center.


 


A graduate of the University of Colorado, Boulder where he majored in broadcast journalism, Kerner originally had career aspirations of playing professional tennis, an opportunity he took a semester off to pursue on the Association of Tennis Professionals tour, but found taxing and expensive.“I didn’t have a coach. I had minimal sponsorship for equipment,” Kerner said. “There were a million guys as good as I was.”After graduation, a newly married Kerner decided to reject a job as a reporter in Sioux Falls, South Dakota to join a small team at a startup company called Nelson Jackets which sold sports apparel to both retailers and schools. While it was his first job in sales he found the communication skills he’d learned were what was need to pitch products.His two decades of experience in education started when the company was no longer viable. Based on a reference from a co-worker, he received a job at the University of Portland working in sports marketing and fundraising.But after holding managing positions at Middlebury and Bates College where he handled fundraising efforts totaling millions of dollars, Kerner expressed his newest position is his biggest accomplishment.“Professionally, this is the most important thing that has happened to me,” he said. “This is a job people work their entire career for. Every day I walk into my office I recognize what a privilege it is.”New vice president of finance and administration Ryan Nesbit found excitement in his position which he held as the interim vice president since July 1, 2013 when Tim Burgess retired.“I’m humbled to serve in this opportunity on a permanent basis,” he said.


 


A Pittsburgh native, he graduated from The Citadel in South Carolina before receiving a Masters in business administration at UGA.He subsequently joined the facilities management team as a business manager before taking a leave of absence to serve as the venue operations manager in the Olympics for Sanford Stadium, an experience he found an early preparation for his work as vice president.Nesbit was responsible for facilities, food services, parking and transportation.“It gave me a real appreciation for the planning and management that goes into a major event,” he said.In 2000, he took over as the budget director and became integral in team that drafted the proposal for the Miller Learning Center, something he is reminded of often.“Every time I walk there or drive by I recall being a part of the great team that turned it into the extraordinary place it is now,” he said.Despite his two decades at UGA, Nesbit did not plan to say so long. He planned to use his experience to go into athletics administration, but he doesn’t regret the path he’s taken.“I love the people here,” he said. “The students are so passionate about what they’re pursuing. The faculty is so passionate about what they teach and the staff is so passionate about providing the support we all need.”

His work moving forward as vice president in part he says will be focused on making operations more efficient to keep rising costs down for students, a plan that includes saving on millions on energy costs.Russell Mumper, an administrator at the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill, was named vice provost for the University of Georgia earlier this month.Mumper, vice dean and McNeill Distinguished Professor at UNC’s Eshelman School of Pharmacy, will assume his position on Aug. 18.Mumper’s position will include working on initiatives from the provost’s office and advising the provost on academic appointments and appeals processes as well as faculty development, promotion and tenure.“The appointment of Dr. Mumper as vice provost reflects my intention to greatly enhance the role of the provost’s office as a catalyst for transformational change at UGA,” said Pamela Whitten, senior vice president for academic affairs and provost, in a UGA Today news release. “He will work closely with deans and other members of the senior administration to aggressively pursue the shared goal of making this institution a global pacesetter in teaching, research and service.”",Richard Banton @mrgamechange,uganews,https://www.redandblack.com/uganews/three-uga-admins-appointed-begin-tenure-during-summer/article_e6273f80-0e57-11e4-aa31-0017a43b2370.html
22-Jul-14,UGA defensive lineman Jon Taylor arrested on aggravated assault charges,"University of Georgia football player Jon Taylor was arrested Tuesday morning by UGA police at McWhorter Hall on the charges of aggravated assault.Police and emergency medical services were dispatched around 2:47 a.m. after a third-party caller reported to them that Taylor, a defensive lineman from Millen, attempted to strangle his girlfriend during a domestic dispute in his McWhorter Hall dorm room around 2:30.Arriving at Busbee Hall, police and EMS made contact with the third party-caller and the victim at Busbee Hall in East Campus Village, according to UGA police chief Jimmy Williamson. Based on the victim's statement police determined that an incident occurred at McWhorter Hall, where Taylor is a resident.


 


""We went to McWhorter Hall and made contact with ... Taylor,"" Williamson said. ""Based on evidence at the scene, officers felt there was probable cause to proceed with a charge against Mr. Taylor for agg assault/domestic violence.""Although the victim did not require transportation to a medical facility for treatment, Williamson said there was physical evidence of an altercation.""There were visible signs on her neck of an altercation,"" he said.Under an amended Georgia law which took effect July 1, strangulation now falls under aggravated assault.UGA police arrested Taylor without incident. At 6:08 a.m. Taylor was booked into Clarke County jail, where he is awaiting bond. Because he faces a felony charge, he must go before a judge for a bond hearing.Taylor was arrested earlier in the year along with former Bulldogs Tray Matthews and Uriah LeMay and Bulldog defensive lineman James DeLoach on charges of theft by deception. He plead into the pre-trial intervention program, but this citation is a violation of the pre-trial intervention terms.Taylor recorded nine tackles, one sack and 1.5 tackles-for-loss as a defensive lineman for the Bulldogs in 2013. No suspension was handed out for his involvement in the theft by deception case from March.The Red & Black reached out to the athletic department but no comment has yet been made.

4-Aug-14,"Comic Con full of unexpected, exciting announcments","This year’s comic con, a comic book fan gathering turned pop-culture convention and held in San Diego, was full of expected announcements, puzzling appearances, and wonderful reveals for the realm of film, television, and general culture.Film news is usually in the form of cast announcements and new trailers and this year was no real exception. The cast of Joss Whedon’s Avengers: Age of Ultron gathered to talk about the upcoming sequel and show off the new cast members including Josh Brolin and up and coming Elizabeth Olsen. On a similar note, with the release of Guardians of the Galaxy expected to do well critically and financially, Marvel has greenlit a sequel.Lets not forget the teaser for the highly anticipated DC film Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice. The cast that includes Ben Affleck as the new caped crusader showed a short 30 second teaser for the film the showed the two superheroes on screen together in a great stormy scene. Naturally, it was well received and doubters for the future of Batman could not help but become interested.


 


One of the big surprise appearances came with the arrival of Christopher Nolan and Matthew McConaughey to talk about the highly anticipated space adventure film Interstellar. A new trailer was revealed and buzz for the highly regarded director began anew.Gamers and fans of the HBO series Game of Thrones can rejoice as rumors and announcements came through the grape vine that actress Maisie Williams, who plays Arya Stark in the series, shall play the role of Ellie in the screen adaptation of the critically acclaimed video game The Last of Us.In the television department, the usual song and dance for shows occurred as cast members gathered and answered questions that they could not answer about the upcoming seasons. AMC’s The Walking Dead had a presence to promote their newest season airing this fall.Fans of the Nickelodeon series The Legend of Korra where a bit scared heading in the convention as the series had announced it would not be airing the remainder of its season on television, but rather online. With the fans naturally concerned that this would indicate the series certain cancellation, the creators of he show insisted that the show would not be cancelled as they have already agreed to a third season. It is a bold decision for the series that has so many diehard fans, so hopefully it plays out well for them.A big surprise occurred when director Sam Raimi announced his return to the acclaimed Evil Dead series in the form of television. On top of that, the wonderful Bruce Campbell is in talks to return and star as the series well known protagonist Ash Williams.The big surprise, however, is how wonderfully well received the footage for the Mad Max reboot was. The new film, subtitled Fury Road, stars Tom Hardy as the titular Max that was made famous by Mel Gibson in the 70’s and 80’s. The action, blood, dirt, and craziness were all there and it is now on the top of many attendees list of films to see next year.With several of the films not even being released until after next years convention, it will be interesting to see how for developers have come since their reveals this year.

5-Aug-14,"Practice report: Chris Conley, Justin Scott-Wesley in non-contact jerseys","After four practices in helmets and in shells, the Georgia Bulldogs football team held its first full pads practice of the fall season Tuesday.The media was allowed a 15-minute observation period. Here are the observations made by the Red & Black.
Senior wide receiver Chris Conley and junior wide receiver Justin Scott-Wesley both wore non-contact green jerseys during Tuesday’s practice. They were involved in movement drills and appeared as if they could participate in route running drills, but were held out of all drills involving contact.
For the second straight day, sophomore outside linebacker Leonard Floyd was in a green jersey as well. The only other defender that joined Floyd in green was junior cornerback Shattle Fenteng, who was seen being evaluated by trainers during Monday’s practice. Senior linebacker Ramik Wilson once again was on the field but not dressed out, simply wearing a jersey with no helmet or pads.
Being that the team was in full pads for the first time, it showcased early a three-on-three drill where a running back would try to move toward a goal line through a series of cones with three blockers in front of him and three defenders trying to get to him. Though there was plenty of hitting going on, perhaps the most notable happening to come out of this drill was the talking. Senior linebacker Amarlo Herrera and junior tailback Todd Gurley could be seen as the main catalysts for motivation for their respective sides. While Gurley spent most of his time motivating his offensive teammates, Herrera spent some time trash talking with some offensive players, especially with the injured Scott-Wesley.
As for who actually looked strong in the drills, freshman wide receiver Isaiah McKenzie showed up well, both blocking from his wide receiver position and running the ball as a tailback. On his first play as a blocker, McKenzie pancaked a defender across the formation, drawing applause from his teammates.
Sophomore safety J.J. Green also fared well, recording a couple of tackles and evading blocks well to get to the running back.
Green wasn’t the only player who switched positions to make some noise in the drill, as cornerback-turned-wide receiver Brendan Langley both proved his ability to block and was the recipient of some of Herrera’s smack talk, undoubtedly in some way linked to his status as a former defender.
Freshman tailback Sony Michel showcased some of the burst that he was known for in high school at American Heritage High School in Plantation, Florida, being one of the few players to score in just one down. Michel found a narrow crease and appeared to be virtually untouched en route to a score.
In other drills, the defensive backs were given license to hit one another. Under the tutelage of defensive coordinator Jeremy Pruitt, the defensive backs worked pursuit tackling out of a “cover 2” defense, or the defense where cornerbacks are responsible for the short flats and the two safeties are responsible for the deep halves of the field. Pruitt lived up to his reputation as a show-not-tell coach, acting out each and every one of the defensive backs’ responsibilities before the drill began.
On a cameo note, Georgia men’s basketball coach Mark Fox was in attendance for Tuesday’s practice, appearing to be amused by the three-on-three drill.

14-Aug-14,Football notebook: Richt remains confident in receivers despite injuries,"In Mark Richt’s mind, experience is more valuable than depth for the injury-plagued Georgia Bulldogs receiving corps.At Wednesday’s practice, six of the 13 receivers on the practice field were limited in some regard including senior Chris Conley, junior Justin Scott-Wesley and freshman Isaiah McKenzie. This occurred in addition to the fact that junior wide receiver Malcolm Mitchell has not practiced in two weeks and no prognosis has been given for his return.“The good news is the good majority of those guys have had the opportunity,” Richt said. “I think we’ve got enough in the fold with experience that we have a pretty good idea. They know what to do and when the time comes they’ll be ready.”


 


With the nature of these injuries to the receiving corps still unknown, it is hard to gauge exactly who will be playing or when the injured players will return to full-contact activities. However, Richt did indicate that he will guess that most of the players wearing non-contact green jerseys in practice will be fully participant in the team’s scrimmages this weekend.As for Mitchell, Richt remained hush about the status of the playmaking junior.“I don’t know,” Richt said about whether or not Mitchell could return for August 30’s season opener against Clemson. “I’d just as soon not get into that.”Searching for stabilityBoth Georgia’s offensive line and defensive backfield have been constant question marks this offseason. As the regular season nears ever closer, these questions are nearing resolutions.On the offensive line, Richt said that the problem is not finding five players to play, it’s figuring out which five to play and where to play them.“We need to name a starting five here pretty soon, and get them working together as long as we can,” Richt said. “But we have been mixing and matching a lot. It’s been an open competition.”Richt went on to say that eight or nine players could figure into the rotation on the offensive line including freshmen Isaiah Wynn and Dyshon Sims. He also said that nobody has played perfectly every day but positive strides are being made toward finding who the unit will be.


 


As for the defensive backfield, Richt and defensive coordinator Jeremy Pruitt are still searching for who will be the cornerback to line up opposite senior Damian Swann, and which safeties will line up behind them.Richt said that freshman cornerback Rico Johnson and junior cornerback Devin Bowman are both playing into consideration at cornerback, and the safety position is being led by senior Corey Moore, sophomore Quincy Mauger, redshirt freshman Aaron Davis and freshman Dominick Sanders.“We’re just trying to find the best combination back there right now,” Richt said. “[Pruitt] likes to teach things in concepts, so he likes for all of them to know what everybody else is doing and even have some functionality, and not just the knowledge but the ability to do it. It’s not a settled situation at all I don’t think.”Elsewhere in the secondary, Richt mentioned that sophomore J.J. Green and freshman Malkom Parrish have emerged as the candidates to play in the “star” position ,and that junior cornerback Shattle Fenteng has returned to full-contact drills after playing injured for a week.Full house at fullbackWith senior fullback Merritt Hall having been medically disqualified from playing football on Thursday, the situation at fullback has become significantly more complicated.While freshmen Detric Bing-Dukes and Christian Payne have moved from inside linebacker to fullback in recent days, junior tight end Quayvon Hicks has not moved back to his old position.“I don’t think Quayvon back to fullback right now anyway,” Richt said. “But him being in there as a tight end he can easily shift to a fullback position and know what to do. We think he can still play some fullback snaps without changing rooms and changing his coach.”


TNCMS.AdManager.render({region: 'fixed-big-ad-bottom-asset', slot: 1, fold: ""below""});


Hicks rushed 10 times for 72 yards and one touchdown as a fullback for the Bulldogs in 2013, something Richt said Hicks has not forgotten how to do. But Richt said the memory of what Hicks could do didn’t outweigh doing what he and the rest of the coaching staff believed was the best thing for the team.“The thing about this entire staff is we do want to make the moves that are best for Georgia. So if [Bing-Dukes] has a chance to play a lot or even start possibly as a fullback than he can as a linebacker right now, then let’s get him position to do that right now.”",Nick Suss,sports,https://www.redandblack.com/sports/football-notebook-richt-remains-confident-in-receivers-despite-injuries/article_4fbd3bb6-23de-11e4-a077-001a4bcf6878.html

Later, the two transition to talking about the positional versatility and uncertainty in the defensive backfield contrasted against the relative stability of the linebacking corps.

18-Aug-14,Winners/Losers of Georgia football fall camp,"With the beginning of a fall semester comes the end of summer. Though this may mean many things for students, for members of the Georgia football team, this means the end of fall camp, the grueling two-week ordeal characterized by heat, two-a-days and morning practices. As the team transitions out of camp mode and into the process of preparing for its first game, now is the time to reflect on fall camp and remember who stood out and who didn't during this season’s fall session.WINNERS:Damian Swann: Though Swann was oft-criticized in 2013 for his lackluster performances, all indications from fall camp say that Swann is not only the leader of Georgia’s secondary, but the only uncontested starter. Defensive coordinator Jeremy Pruitt has hailed Swann as the only defensive back he feels is developed enough to where he could play cornerback, safety and star. If all news coming out of camp holds true heading into 2014, Swann is poised for a return to his 2012 form.


 


Isaiah Wynn: A freshman offensive lineman, Wynn has been the standout newcomer not only on the offensive line, but on the offense in general. Everyone from senior center David Andrews to coach Mark Richt praised the versatile and strong nature of Wynn’s play. Wynn is capable of lining up as both a guard and a center and has been listed by Richt as one of the eight or nine players who will figure into the offensive line rotation in the season opener against Clemson.Rico Johnson: A wide receiver until directly before fall camp began, the freshman Johnson has wowed his coaches and teammates as a cornerback, so much so that he is believed to be receiving plenty of first-team reps at the position. Sophomore safety Quincy Mauger said that the source of Johnson’s ability stems from his recovery speed, which sets Johnson apart from many of his teammates. In a year in which Swann is the only certainty in the Georgia secondary, Johnson’s standout fall camp could lead to him seeing significant playing time and possibly even a starting position in the regular season.LOSERS:Brendan Douglas: It isn’t that Douglas had a poor camp that puts him in this category, in fact, he hasn’t. Rather it is who was added to the team that puts the sophomore tailback in a precarious situation. Though Douglas has remained third on the depth chart behind juniors Todd Gurley and Keith Marshall, the arrivals of freshmen tailbacks Sony Michel and Nick Chubb have drawn a lot of reps and attention away from Douglas. If Chubb and Michel continue to progress as expected, this fall could have been the beginning of the end for Douglas.Tony Ball: Not a player but a position coach, wide receivers coach Tony Ball may have been the biggest loser of this year’s camp. Not only has Ball had to practice without junior wide receiver Malcolm Mitchell, who had knee surgery just before camp began, but he’s had to contend with a plethora of minor injuries at his position. Everyone from seniors Chris Conley and Jonathon Rumph to junior Justin Scott-Wesley, sophomores Reggie Davis, Kenneth Towns and Clay Johnson to freshman Isaiah McKenzie have been limited for at least one practice this fall, making it difficult for Ball to get a strong gauge of what he has.Ramik Wilson: The Southeastern Conference’s returning leader in tackles from 2013, Wilson is still a starter at inside linebacker for the Bulldogs. However, Wilson missed significant time with an injury that kept him sidelined for most of camp. Because of how many practices he missed, it might take Wilson a little longer to return to playing form and it may be harder for him to be in complete shape for Clemson.",Nick Suss,sports,https://www.redandblack.com/sports/winners-losers-of-georgia-football-fall-camp/article_a892f200-262a-11e4-a4a5-001a4bcf6878.html
20-Aug-14,Another student hit by vehicle on Baldwin Street,"A University of Georgia student was hit by a vehicle in the crosswalk in front of Joseph E. Brown Hall at approximately 3:45 p.m. on Wednesday.The victim, a senior accounting major at UGA, allegedly cracked the windshield of the red pickup truck, which was driven by what appeared to be a middle-aged man, according to eyewitnesses. The student was not knocked unconscious by the crash, although he did appear to have a leg injury.""My head hit the windshield, I think the windshield cracked,"" the victim said.


 


Eyewitnesses said several bystanders ran to the victim’s aid and called 911, and a police officer was flagged down.The victim said he was walking through the crosswalk while a bus idled in the middle of the street.“I was just walking out but then this car [came] flying out,” he said.Christy Smith, a graduate student at UGA, said she witnessed the incident.“I was just about to use my phone, and I looked up as the bus stopped ... saw [the victim] get off the bus, come around and [the vehicle] hit him,” she said.Upon impact with the truck, the victim had trouble getting to his feet, Smith said.“He was barely standing up, trying to stand up, so I helped him over to the side of the sidewalk and set him down,” she said.Smith said she asked the victim questions such as, “Do you know what date it is?” to make sure he was OK.

20-Aug-14,Scouting Report: Jonathan Ledbetter,"Name: Jonathan LedbetterPosition: Defensive EndSchool: Tucker High School


 


Height: 6-foot-4Weight: 265 lbs.Our take:Georgia made its second big addition to its defensive line last Saturday, when Jonathan Ledbetter flipped on his decision to go to Alabama and committed to Georgia.His brother, Joseph Ledbetter, transferred to Georgia after playing two years of basketball at Pfeiffer University and is now working with the Bulldogs’ tight ends. If all goes to plan The defensive end from Tucker will be reunited with his brother in 2015.Ledbetter is listed by 247Sports.com as the fifth-best strong-side defensive end in the nation and comes in at 72nd overall in his composite score. His high school highlights prove that he can get to the ball in the backfield. Video shows Ledbetter’s speed in taking down mobile quarterbacks with jumps off the line and displays his ability to weave through holes to bottle up the opponent’s inside running game.Ledbetter, an Under Armour All-American, has also taken some snaps on the offensive side of the ball. Ledbetter lined up as a tight end, hitting his blocking assignment, locking up the opposing defensive end and driving him downfield to give his running back enough room for a 42-yard touchdown run.While his versatility is a plus, Ledbetter’s frame means Georgia will likely utilize him for his defensive prowess. Georgia defensive coordinator, Jeremy Pruitt, may have other plans for Ledbetter when he joins the team in 2015. Ledbetter is listed at the same position as one of Georgia’s shiniest new prospects, freshman Lorenzo Carter. If Carter’s freshman year proves to be worth the hype, Ledbetter may find himself competing at another position next fall, especially since Pruitt has shown no fear in testing his players’ versatility.


 


Ledbetter’s commitment to Georgia goes beyond stats and credentials. The fact that he flipped from Alabama is a blip on the usually flat-lining heart monitor that maintains the life of the Bulldogs’ in- state recruiting endeavors. This is an area where Georgia football has struggled in the past, and still does in the metro counties like Gwinnett and Cobb. Ledbetter’s decision could be a sign that Georgia’s new defensive personnel is helping the program gain ground against the other SoutheasternConference powerhouses in recruiting Georgia’s to high school talents.",Taylor Denman,sports,https://www.redandblack.com/sports/scouting-report-jonathan-ledbetter/article_c2f0e43c-27e6-11e4-ac11-0017a43b2370.html
20-Aug-14,Football notebook: Malcolm Mitchell's status for Clemson still unknown,"For the Georgia football team, it's all about Clemson from Wednesday on.Wednesday’s practice represented the first time that both of the first team units took the same sideline to practice against the scout team, which represented the Tigers.The Bulldogs started from the beginning.


 


“The main thing that we were trying to get accomplished today was to rehearse our pre-game warm up,” Georgia head coach Mark Richt said. “Sounds kind of boring but we want to look like we know what we’re doing a week from Saturday.”It wasn’t all stretching, though. Richt also had his team play one half of football against the scout team, mostly to work on transitions between units and getting into the infancy stages of preparing for full-game speed.“We wanted to play a half of football to where we could learn to transition from a kicking snap to an offensive snap, to another kicking snap to a defensive snap, to another kicking snap,” Richt said. “For the most part, we transitioned pretty good. The only problem is, for example, the great majority of our special teams were in red but there were just a couple guys on the other team that had to come over.”Richt acknowledged that the tempo of the practice was not on par with a regular game. This will be one of the key points as Georgia continues to prepare for Clemson in the handful of practices left, especially for the sake of the incoming freshman that have only experience G-Day.That being said, it’s not like a faster pace or tougher competition is completely foreign to either unit.“It’s going to be very difficult to get the proper assimilation, it’s really true of any game,” Richt said. When you ask a scout team to be the other team, it’s just very, very hard to do it … That’s why we continue throughout the year to go best-on-best or at least ones-versus-twos, twos-versus-ones because if all you do is scout team work, you do lose the feel of how fast a game moves.”Richt updates Malcolm Mitchell’s statusFor the most part, Richt has been very tight-lipped about his team’s injuries during fall camp. However, he gave his first bit of news on the status of receiver Malcolm Mitchell, who suffered another knee setback before the start of fall camp.


 


“He did a little bit of running, in the water, anyway,” Richt said. “I don’t know if he’s out on the ground yet.”While it isn’t much, it seems increasingly less likely that Mitchell will be available against Clemson on Aug. 30.",Cody Pace,sports,https://www.redandblack.com/sports/football-notebook-malcolm-mitchell-s-status-for-clemson-still-unknown/article_3f7ff130-28ca-11e4-9f0a-001a4bcf6878.html
20-Aug-14,Kirk Herbstreit favors Georgia to win SEC East,"ESPN College GameDay Analyst Kirk Herbstreit is confident in the Georgia football team.During a conference call with national media on Tuesday, Herbstreit said that he believes the Bulldogs should be a favorite to win the Southeastern Conference Eastern division. One of the reasons he believes this to be true is the addition of new defensive coordinator Jeremy Pruitt.“He has inherited a veteran group and he is a big reason I like Georgia to win the SEC East,” Herbstreit said. “I’m very excited to see the difference makes with that defense; I think it will be profound.”


 


Pruitt will be taking over Georgia defense that ranked 79th in scoring defense, 43rd in run defense and only created 15 turnovers a year ago. With coach Pruitt specializing in the secondary, changes have already been made, not just in attitude, but also scheme.“He is basically a coach that brings a lot of Nick Saban mannerisms with a hybrid 4-3 scheme with 3-4 tendencies,” Herbstreit said.This is a drastic change from last season when players were noticeably confused under former defensive coordinator Todd Grantham’s system. Pruitt is taking a much simpler approach, and communication with players has also increased as he holds them accountable for mistakes. Pruitt treats the players like men and is quick to give praise for great play, but not shy when it comes to their mistakes. With many starters returning from last year, the defense could be poised for a much better season.“He [Pruitt] has a way of confusing offensive linemen and quarterbacks,” Herbstreit said. “He has a way of relating to players. He gets them to play with heart by simplifying things, yet he makes things complicated for the offense at the same time.”",Jaylon Thompson,sports,https://www.redandblack.com/sports/kirk-herbstreit-favors-georgia-to-win-sec-east/article_03462096-2806-11e4-a334-0017a43b2370.html
20-Aug-14,Column: SEC Network must prioritize content over sensationalism,"The notion that Southeastern Conference fans have an insatiable appetite for content regarding their favorite teams is about as old news as the fall of the Roman Empire. For football fans across the Southeast and beyond, Aug. 14 ushered in an unequaled quencher of their pride-fueled thirsts.ESPN’s SEC Network is unparalleled because similar channels that preceded it have not the reach this new network boasts. Unlike Longhorn Network and the Big Ten Network, SEC Network has the luxury of describing itself as a national network rather than a regional one; as of now, only one national carrier — Verizon FiOS — has yet to pick up the network and its programming.That national scope presents an opportunity for the network to set a precedent within a conference largely concerned with 250-pound man children tackling one another for free. Those who turn to SEC Network for its football coverage will also be exposed to non-revenue-generating sports and women’s sports in the form of at least 450 various sporting events, giving the network the power to shine the limelight on other athletes for a change.


 


The channel’s programming prides itself on its balanced coverage of the conference’s 14 universities, providing segments devoted not only to the football programs, but also to men’s and women’s basketball, baseball, softball, volleyball, etc. The network is void of Skip Bayless, but the talking heads spewing hot takes may still be hard to evade.As of now, SEC Network’s daily lineup includes SEC Now, a news show modeled after ESPN’s flagship program Sports Center, an array of college football preview shows, reruns of monumental wins and heartbreaking losses and a four hour block dedicated to the ramblings of Paul Finebaum. A. Four. Hour. Block.Such programming makes sense, for now. College football is right around the corner and this is what the people want, after all. But soon enough, the shows and segments will need to incorporate all facets of an SEC athletic program. What happens when any old Tom, Dick or Harry calls the folks up in Charlotte, North Carolina wondering why a bunch of ladies are kicking around a ball on his TV when he could be watching Tray Matthews’ and Josh Harvey-Clemons’ enshrinement into the college football hall of infamy?  This is television, folks. Although I assume the network has very specific contractual obligations with each university to promote sports other than football, it’s hard to believe the overall coverage will be anything near balanced.Enter Tuesday morning’s episode of SEC Now.Former Bulldog Maria Taylor is on the TV in front of me, breaking down Johnny Manziel’s performance on Monday Night Football. He is an NFL quarterback, and a backup no less as the news that Brian Hoyer had been named the Browns’ starter broke earlier that morning. Yet, here we are, subjected to content that has absolutely zero SEC relevance as of May 8.I don’t want to watch Browns preseason highlights, and you don’t either.The next news nugget incorporated into the show seemed just as unnecessary. Ohio State’s Braxton Miller is out for the season with a shoulder injury. Geography quiz: Where is Ohio State? Not in the SEC, you are correct. Yet some ballsy production calls resulted in host Dari Nowkhah leading a segment about what player each of the 14 SEC teams couldn’t figuratively live without. Such hypothetical nonsense is the brain child of a producer stifled by a slow news day.


 


SEC Network has a lot of potential and the right intentions. Once fall sports are in full swing, a slow news day will be hard to come by. But the talking heads model doesn’t seem to be going anywhere. It’ll be up to ESPN and its executives to decide what content is more compelling. And if history and the demands of Tom, Dick and Harry are any indication, we’ll be watching Johnny Football and his Browns highlights for the next five years.",Tanya Sichynsky,sports,https://www.redandblack.com/sports/column-sec-network-must-prioritize-content-over-sensationalism/article_71bb8dde-28d0-11e4-94e8-001a4bcf6878.html
21-Aug-14,"O'Bannon, autonomy poised to change the landscape of college athletics","Aug. 7 and 8 could go down as two of the most important dates in the history of the modern college athletes’ rights movement.On the former, the NCAA Division I board of directors voted to allow the Power Five conferences — the Atlantic Coast Conference, Big 10, Big 12, Pacific 12 and the Southeastern Conference — the autonomy to make rules more conducive to their financial capabilities. The ruling could mean that those conferences provide full cost of attendance, more financial support to injured players and even loosen rules on the contact between agents and athletes.On the latter, judge Claudia Wilken handed down a 99-page decision in the Ed O’Bannon v. NCAA case that ruled in favor of O’Bannon and his challenge to the NCAA’s licensing of the use of his and other players’ likenesses in the EA Sports college basketball franchise. Wilken’s ruling went beyond just the use of player likenesses in video games — it changes the way athletes are to be compensated and challenged many of the pillars of the NCAA’s model of amateurism.


 


Both of these decisions, if upheld, change how athletes are treated by universities and will drastically alter the landscape of college athletics.“You hate to say it this way, but it’s sort of a perfect storm, isn’t it?” said Georgia law professor David Shipley, the university’s faculty representative to the Athletic Association.O’Bannon and the logic of trust fundsThe most potentially influential part of Wilkens’ ruling came in regards to the meat of the lawsuit: the use of player names, likenesses and images.Wilken ruled that schools must begin to share a portion of the money that they generate by licensing athletes’ likenesses to companies. Specifically, she said that schools must create trust funds for their athletes, in which they will place their share of the licensing revenue until they graduate. Once athletes graduate, they will be able to access that money.This won’t be the first time that a trust fund system has been attempted in amateur sports.“Back in the Olympics when you had to be an amateur, some sports tried this, so track and field tried this,” Georgia professor of applied economics Jeffrey Dorfman said. “You were allowed to take money out of your escrow account for training expenses and then the rest had to stay in until you were done competing and then you could collect it so it’s kind of similar to this idea.”Then in the 1980s came Carl Lewis, the eight-time gold medalist sprinter. The story goes that, while training in Houston, Lewis bought an expensive house, car and fine china all as training expenses.


 


“He was just spending his money however he felt like and saying it’s a training expense, ‘I’ve got to eat, I’ve got to drive to the track, got to have a house to live in,’ all this until they just got so embarrassed and humiliated they just said, ‘You know what? guys, just take the money, it’s your money,’ and they got rid of the escrow accounts,” Dorfman said.Also, while Wilken’s decision tore apart many aspects of the NCAA’s amateurism, she didn’t dismiss the entire idea and allowed for a cap on the trust fund account, as long as that value did not go below $5,000 per year.“I think the one thing that was surprising about the ruling was that, so she ruled that basically the NCAA could maintain amateurism but the rules that it had were too restrictive,” associate professor of journalism Welch Suggs said. “I was a bit surprised that she actually didn’t say that amateurism simply was not a valuable product, that it could be substituted for other products in the marketplace.”Along those lines, Dorfman pointed out two flaws with the arbitrary cap value. The first was a logical fallacy in the thinking that waiting until graduation for the payout somehow alters the state of amateurism.“Does it make them more of a professional if they get the $5,000 the minute they graduate?” Dorfman said. “If somebody said to a high school senior, ‘If you come play football at Alabama, I will give you $1 million the day your eligibility is up or you graduate or whatever.’ We call that a violation, right? How’s that different from an escrow account you get once you graduate?”The second issue is that setting a cap around $5,000 guarantees that players won’t necessarily get a share of the money equal to what they bring in. While $5,000 might be enough to cover the appropriate share of the revenue generated by a baseball or basketball player, it limits what a highly marketable, elite athlete can receive, regardless of how much their likeness profits their university.“So we made this fair by giving Johnny Manziel $5,000 he gets when he graduates?” Dorfman said. “I’m pretty sure [Texas A&M] made way more than $5,000 marketing Johnny Manziel.”Amatuerism, competitive balance and taxes

While the cap on player compensation could be altered in many different ways as the NCAA appeals the decision, Wilkens’ strong language on many other issues of amateurism in her ruling are sure to continue to resurface throughout the appellate process.Wilkens challenged the NCAA on its continually changing definition of amateurism to fit its own needs and dismissed many of the key arguments for maintaining the current system, including the idea that the demand for college football depends on unpaid amateurism, that the athletes’ academic experience would be hindered, that paying players would decrease competitive balance and that paying players would cause teams to leave.Wilkens argued that the demand will be high for college football regardless of whether players are compensated. She said that paying players would be no different than other college students that have jobs or who are wealthier. She also cited that just a handful of teams already dominate recruiting for top-tier talent to strike down the competitive balance argument, and she also cited the NCAA’s lack of evidence in reference to teams that would leave.While the first two points have been more widely agreed upon, the competitive balance argument and the argument that some teams would leave before paying beyond the cost of a scholarship have not.To the competitive balance argument, sports economist Andy Schwarz of Sports Geekonomics quantified Wilkens’ arguments that a few teams already dominate recruiting in a Deadspin.com piece. What Schwarz found was a high correlation between recruiting success in one season and recruiting success in the next.While this would likely hold true and continue regardless of whether or not teams were required to pay for the licensing of players’ likenesses, as the cap on the trust fund increased, it’s very likely that the number of competitive teams would decrease.“If the limits come off, whether it's how much you can pay or how much you can put in an escrow account, we certainly go from however many schools there are now that at least imagine they can compete for the national championship or league championships which is what, 30 or 40, to what, five?” Dorfman said. “It becomes a really small number.”To the other argument, Wilken says that, “The real difference between schools in Division I and schools in other divisions and athletics associations … is the amount of resources that Division I schools commit to athletics.” Because of this, she argued that the schools wouldn’t be in Division I if they weren’t already willing to sink money into athletics. Some economists, such as Schwarz, agree with this standpoint while others, such as Dorfman, believe that this could cause some schools to reach a tipping point. Regardless, it's not going to keep the concern out of everyone’s minds.

“I think if you look at the 65 schools in the five major conferences, I’m sure there are more than a handful, maybe a substantial number in there that, how they’re going to do this and make ends meet is going to be tough,” Shipley said. “We have not talked about that directly as [faculty athletic representatives] but I think it’s in the back of everybody’s minds.”Finally, the ruling leaves open the potential that athletic scholarships could be differentiated from academic scholarships and be considered as compensation for playing the sport. This could have devastating consequences counterproductive to what the players are trying to accomplish.“I would argue that that’s probably wrong and going to be really bad for the players,” Dorfman said. “If the judges ruling stands and that is not just an inducement like any other scholarship to get you to come to the University of Georgia but actually pay for playing football, then the IRS is going to say that’s taxable income.”According to Dorfman, this could result in athletes paying as much as $5,000 in income taxes.Is autonomy the answer?As the NCAA continues to lose traction on the many fronts of the players’ rights front, middle ground continues to be sought.In this spirit, the power grab of the Power Five conferences for autonomy could be interpreted as a step to meet players in the middle on some of the issues related less to direct payment and more to player safety.“The whole point of the autonomy move is to give athletes all of these wonderful benefits without entering into an employment contract,” Suggs said. “That really would have pretty devastating effects for all of college sports if athletes were deemed to be employees with full rights under a system where they contracted with a school on a fee-for-service basis.”

The move toward autonomy will allow teams in these conferences to provide better health coverage, longer-term care for concussion-related injuries and potential access to agents earlier in the draft process, among other things. It also shifts the government structure of the NCAA to give those conferences greater voting power and will give student athletes 15 of the 80 spots on the new voting panel, as well as providing student athletes with a full-cost-of-attendance stipend.For larger and more profitable schools such as Georgia, the full cost of attendance— a value calculated by the financial aid offices of every university based on guidelines from the federal government— is an easily doable expenditure that could begin sooner rather than later.“If there is not an override then I assume the five major conferences could start to collaborate and work together on sort of coming up with these things that are specific to them and I think we’re prepared probably here to implement things as soon as they say we can,” Shipley said. “We’ve done calculations about what it would cost for the program to go with full cost of attendance. Our budget is in pretty good shape so I think we can hit the ground running once we know we can go ahead with some of these things.”As the faculty advisor responsible for watching out for the welfare of student athletes, Shipley made a list of several things he felt the University could do right away, including better health coverage, insurance and the four-year awards. While all of these things will be allowed to be provided by non-Power-Five school it is unlikely. In fact, that stipend, compounded with the new regulations on paying players for their likeness, could be what ultimately pushes some teams out of a power five conference.“The schools that can’t drive as much money from their stadiums … are going to have a hard time keeping up in terms of the kind of menu of things that is going to be laid out under autonomy,” Suggs said. “Those schools and the universities … have made such a huge investment in being members of the Big 10 or the SEC or whatever that they are likely to make up that money from institutional sources, whether it’s student fees or moving money from the general fund.”While using institutional money could help subsidize the growth in spending for a time, it’s hardly a long-term solution for those teams that continue to fail to bring in a profit from their athletic departments. Out of the 48 public schools currently in the power conferences, only Utah, Minnesota, Washington State, UCLA and University of California spent less than the FBS median on athletics per athlete in 2012 according to the database on athletic and academic spending provided by the Knight Commission.While most Power Five schools spent more than the FBS median on athletics, 17 of them spent more than $10,000 per athlete of institutional money on athletics and Arizona State, Virginia, Colorado, Maryland and Oregon State all spent more than $10 million of institutional money on athletics. These are just the 2012 values with the Knight Commission predicting the median value of institutional money spent by all FBS schools to double by 2020.“I think there’s even more moral dimensions than economic dimensions because just consider this: think about if you had to take out student loans to pay the student fees that were being designated to athletics. How would that make you feel as a student? You wouldn’t be very happy,” Suggs said. “I think there are eventual limits and I think there’s just real serious questions universities have to ask themselves about whether this is fair to raise money from these sources.”",Cody Pace,sports,https://www.redandblack.com/sports/o-bannon-autonomy-poised-to-change-the-landscape-of-college/article_96c96614-28cb-11e4-9c83-001a4bcf6878.html
22-Aug-14,Football notebook: John Theus finally moving over to left tackle,"When junior offensive tackle John Theus was recruited, he was supposed to be the left tackle of the Georgia football team's future.Now, in his third season, it looks like he’s going to get that chance.“I think he’s had a good camp and he’s practiced hard and he came in good shape and he’s worked hard all camp,” offensive line coach Will Friend said.


 


In his first two seasons Theus sat behind Kenarious Gates at left tackle and saw limited time at both the left and right tackle spots. This season, the former five-star recruit has made the necessary adjustments to his game and Friend, and offensive coordinator Mike Bobo, are confident in him going forward.“He’s got a little bit better body control,” Bobo said. “He’s improved his strength since last year and he’s in better shape … He’s preparing well and got the right mindset that you’ve got to have. Lineman’s a tough job. It’s dirty, it’s nasty and you’ve got to go out there and grind every day at practice.”At the end of spring practice, it was at least a possibility that Theus would end up at right tackle if senior Kolton Houston had to move to a guard spot. However, the emergence of redshirt sophomore Greg Pyke, sophomore Brandon Kublanow and freshman Isaiah Wynn mean that Theus may have the most secure starting spot, excluding senior three-year center David Andrews.First team All-SEC linebacker not guaranteed starting spotThe Southeastern Conference coaches voted Georgia inside linebacker Ramik Wilson as one of the three best linebackers in the conference, but according to Georgia’s coaches, he’s not even guaranteed a starting spot.Wilson missed time this fall camp with an undisclosed injury, and now the coaches say that he’s in a situation where he’s got to catch up to the rest of the unit.“Any time you miss practice it sets you back and he missed a bunch and it kind of is what it is and we’ve made some moves,” linebackers coach Mike Ekeler said. “He’s trying to battle his way back right now.”Ekeler wouldn’t indicate how close Wilson is to being where the coaches want him, which aligns with the staff’s cryptic approach to the depth chart this season. However, if Wilson really isn’t 100 percent ready for Clemson, there could be some rotation with Tim Kimbrough and Reggie Carter, along with Amarlo Herrera.


 


“It all goes based on the game and who earns it and whatnot,” Ekeler said. “I’d love to play them all but as coach Richt says, it’s not the YMCA. You’ve got to put your best out there and roll with it.”Michel and Chubb will not redshirtAlthough the Bulldogs have Keith Marshall and Todd Gurley back healthy for the start of the season, they plan on using both freshmen Nick Chubb and Sony Michel in some capacity this season.According to Bobo, “all five” running backs will play in some capacity on special teams, at least and all five running backs, being Gurley, Marshall, Chubb, Michel and Brendan Douglas, could see touches against Clemson.“The game will dictate touches and plays and that’s really at any skill position but we’ll, I think all five are doing well,” Bobo said. “We’ll know more after Monday’s practice about who we feel comfortable to really go in the game and get reps and get touches.”",Cody Pace,sports,https://www.redandblack.com/sports/football-notebook-john-theus-finally-moving-over-to-left-tackle/article_2ab3826e-2a62-11e4-87fc-0017a43b2370.html
22-Aug-14,Practice report: Georgia fights off heat with Clemson in sight,"In Friday’s 97-degree heat, the Georgia football team held a practice in full pads as it continues to work toward its first game against Clemson on Aug. 30.The media was given access to two periods of practice. Here are some observations:· Redshirt sophomore fullback Dominic Bryan, junior snapper Nathan Theus, sophomore snapper Trent Frix and senior tailback Kyle Karempelis all donned green jerseys.


 


· The teams avoided working in formations for the second consecutive day. The defensive backs worked on a short backpedal drop back before a coach threw a ball that they tried to react and intercept.· Inside linebackers worked on hitting the blocking dummies at the beginning of the period while the running backs did the same toward the end of the second period.· Outside linebackers worked on their footwork using ladders on the ground. When they reached the end of the ladder, the players sprinted forward and strafed around a coach with a blocking pad a few yards ahead of them.· Wide receivers worked on taking contact at short yardage distance before exploding off into a slant route.· The offensive linemen worked in tandem. One lineman would act as a pass rusher while the other worked on countering different attempts to get both inside and outside of the blocker.· Quarterbacks worked exclusively with tight ends during the media period. They practiced different routes and had the tight end line up on different sides of the quarterback. Starter Hutson Mason worked mostly with Jay Rome and Jordan Davis. Early in the drill Rome dropped a pass on a cross route to the sidelines, which drew dismay from both head coach Mark Richt and offensive coordinator Mike Bobo. Rome also worked with redshirt sophomore Faton Bauta. One tight end who stood out during the drill was freshman Jeb Blazevich, who was praised by Bobo for his route running.· Despite the injury to former fullback Merritt Hall, junior Quayvon Hicks worked strictly with the tight ends. His new role as the H-back could have him play either position.",Cody Pace,sports,https://www.redandblack.com/sports/practice-report-georgia-fights-off-heat-with-clemson-in-sight/article_7563fd7a-2a3f-11e4-888a-001a4bcf6878.html

25-Aug-14,Ramik Wilson listed as backup on Georgia depth chart,"Georgia’s first official depth chart, which was released Monday, came with several surprises.Most of the surprises, however, came on the defensive side of the ball.The position that comes as the most surprising, however, is the mike inside linebacker position. While senior Ramik Wilson was voted as an All-SEC linebacker by the Southeastern Conference coaches, he is listed as a backup to sophomore Tim Kimbrough. Wilson missed several practices this fall after suffering an undisclosed injury that was reported to be a concussion. Coaches have hinted that Wilson was not guaranteed a starting spot and said that he was “behind” after missing practices.


 


The defense is listed with 12 starters to compensate for the multiple looks that defensive coordinator Jeremy Pruitt employs in his defense.At defensive tackle, junior James DeLoach is listed ahead of senior Ray Drew, who started for the Bulldogs last season.The secondary features Devin Bowman on the opposite side of cornerback to Damian Swann, despite a hamstring injury that has kept Bowman out of much of the fall preseason practice. Quincy Mauger, who started seven games for Georgia last season, is listed as the backup strong safety behind senior Corey Moore, while redshirt freshman Aaron Davis is listed as the other starting safety. One of the spring’s biggest standouts, converted running back J.J. Green, has also been topped on the depth chart. Instead, true freshman Dominick Sanders is listed as the starting star, the third cornerback in Pruitt’s defense.While the offense had fewer positions up in the air, coaches managed to keep the battle for backup quarterback clouded by listing redshirt freshman Brice Ramsey or redshirt sophomore Faton Bauta.Georgia also chose to go with a base three-receiver set instead of two receivers and a fullback in wake of the career-ending concussion to former fullback Merritt Hall. Instead, H-back Quayvon Hicks, officially listed as the backup tight end, will most likely play that role in certain packages.The depth chart is not locked in place and can change prior to Saturday’s 5:30 p.m. kickoff.",Cody Pace,sports,https://www.redandblack.com/sports/ramik-wilson-listed-as-backup-on-georgia-depth-chart/article_db2aabc4-2c86-11e4-a586-0017a43b2370.html

29-Aug-14,"Letter to the Editor: Once-a-week meatless meals benefit students' health, environment","Starting college can be an exciting, yet daunting experience. It’s not surprising that, with all the stress that comes with it, many new students gain the dreaded “freshman fifteen.” A study published in Nutrition Journal found that nearly a quarter of freshmen gain at least five percent of their body weight during their first semester, an average of about 10 pounds in just a few months.In an effort to help students look and feel great, the movement toward offering more plant-based meals is taking root on college campuses nationwide. There are more than 200 universities leading the charge with Meatless Monday programs in their dining halls.


 


Why take a weekly holiday from meat? In recent decades our meat consumption has increased dramatically—and along with it, our waistlines, blood pressure and cholesterol. Meat is high in saturated fat, which is associated with obesity and preventable chronic diseases like diabetes, heart disease, some cancers and stroke.A study by the Johns Hopkins School of Public Health found that there is a strong association between meat consumption and obesity. A review published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition concluded, “[A] plant-based diet seems to be a sensible approach for the prevention of obesity….”Even if we can’t switch to a completely plant-based diet, we can make incremental changes. Kaiser Permanente is one of the nation’s largest healthcare and insurance providers. It recently published a “Plant-Based Diet” guide that states: “Any movement toward more plants and fewer animal products can improve your health.”Eating more healthy plant-based meals not only helps our physical health, but can also lighten our carbon footprint. According to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, animal agriculture is “one of the top two or three most significant contributors to the most serious environmental problems, at every scale from local to global.” Factory farms – where nearly all of our meat comes from – are major culprits in climate change. These animal factories create huge amounts of manure that pollute the soil, water and air.


 


Reducing the amount of meat we eat is good for animals as well.  The fewer animals we raise for food means less pressure on animal agriculture to raise them in cruel and intensive ways. High demand for meat has led to the practice of genetically manipulating chickens to rapidly gain weight to the point of obesity, and many can’t walk more than a few steps before collapsing. To help animals, the Humane Society of the United States advocates the Three Rs: “reducing” or “replacing” consumption of animal products, and “refining” our diets by switching to products from sources that adhere to higher animal welfare standards.Thankfully, it’s never been easier to take a positive step toward safeguarding our health, while also protecting the planet and helping animals. Choosing simple, delicious options once a week can make a big difference. How about swapping those chicken nuggets with meat-free nuggets? Or choosing veggie and bean burritos instead of carnitas burritos? Eating out is easy, too. With options like Chipotle and Denny’s serving up hearty meat-free fare and with Indian, Thai and Mexican restaurants that regularly offer delicious plant-based dishes, the options are endless.— Eddie Garza is a food policy coordinator for The Humane Society of the United States.",Eddie Garza,views,https://www.redandblack.com/views/letter-to-the-editor-once-a-week-meatless-meals-benefit/article_ac840c68-2eeb-11e4-a9dc-0017a43b2370.html
31-Aug-14,UGA community discusses best on-campus jobs,"Classes may be the one thing all students at the University of Georgia have in common, but many also seek high-paying or enjoyable jobs on-campus to supplement their academics.UGA Career Center student employment manager Aaron Brown said most students want the same jobs and they are almost always on campus. He said UGA Food Services is the most popular department for students looking for work, as it employs approximately 1,100 students at $7.60 per hour, with the opportunity to get a raise of 15 cents per hour.In addition to hourly pay, Food Services offers student employees benefits, including free meals for every four hour shift and reimbursements for student workers who have already purchased a meal plan. Brown said they also work with students to create flexible schedules, and dining halls are located within walking distance of students’ classes and dormitories, making it an easily accessible campus job.


 


Uriel Gonzalez, a junior biological sciences major from Marietta, obtained his job working at Tate Café through the Food Services website.“I really like my job, and I’d say it works really well with my schedule,” Gonzalez said.The Department of Recreational Sports comes in as the second most popular department to work for, employing approximately 400 students who hold positions such as lifeguards, climbing wall supervisors and intramural sports officials. For some jobs that students have no experience in, recreational sports will provide training, while others do require certifications or experience.The third most popular department is University Housing, which employs more than 300 student employees working as desk assistants, office assistants and resident assistants. In addition to payment and other benefits, such as free housing for RAs, student employees of University Housing get to network with new people and get involved with various events on campus, Brown said. According to the University Housing employment website, “students who work for University Housing often cite that their college years are more memorable.”Last is the UGA Libraries, which has 200 student assistants being paid $7.25 per hour. Students who work at any of the libraries also have the possibility of additional compensation and advancement as a senior student assistant.Because of students’ varying course schedules, UGA library supervisors work with their employees to create a flexible schedule, similar to how Food Services operates. Students can work in departments within the library system such as the Digital Library of Georgia, the Security Unit and Special Collections.Although these may be the most sought after jobs on UGA’s campus, there are other on-campus jobs in other departments that are open to students as well.If students are looking for a higher paying job than the ones above, there is UGA Campus Transit, which pays around $9 to $10 per hour, Brown said, though certain requirements must be met to become a bus or van driver, such as a clean driving record.


 


Most on-campus jobs pay around the minimum wage, but Brown said work experience is beneficial before graduating, no matter how much the job pays.“Most students should expect to earn minimum wage and expect small increases in pay as you progress,” he said. “Experience is the most beneficial aspect of any part-time job and you can highlight this on your resume.”Brown said the easiest way to see which departments are hiring is to use Dawglink, a career service located on the UGA website which is where most supervisors will post job openings. Dawglink receives more than 100 resumes per week, so the job search for part-time, on-campus jobs is certainly competitive, Brown said.For students are looking for work, The Classic Center is hosting a career fair Sept. 17, where more than 200 employers will be present.",Katelyn Umholtz @Kumh0ltz,uganews,https://www.redandblack.com/uganews/campus/uga-community-discusses-best-on-campus-jobs/article_3548af6e-2ef5-11e4-ab83-0017a43b2370.html

31-Aug-14,Georgia backfield stacked with talent,"Juniors Todd Gurley and Keith Marshall and freshmen Sony Michel and Nick Chubb have left Georgia head coach Mark Richt with a good problem — too many talented running backs.Although Marshall struggled in his first game back from a torn anterior cruciate ligament, the other three each ran for at least 5.5 yards per carry while totaling more than 300 yards and four touchdowns on the ground. Although each one of those guys were highly recruited and could have gone their separate ways to be feature backs at their own schools, Richt said it’s no accident that they all ended up together.“These guys are smarter than they used to be. They want to share the load with somebody,” Richt said. “I don’t think anybody wants to carry it 30 times a game for their entire career. I don’t think anybody wants that type of pounding and I don’t think it’s wise … Those guys, they want to have a running buddy, so to speak.”


 


Still, that doesn’t make getting four talented backs the appropriate carries in the appropriate situations easier for Richt and offensive coordinator Mike Bobo. Georgia took some flack in the first half for only giving Gurley four carries, but then he exploded for two touchdowns in the second half and finished with 198 yards.The possibility is that Georgia could try and get two running backs on the field at the same time instead of a fullback or a tight end in certain sets, but Richt and Bobo are cautious about doing that.“If you have some guys with some diverse skills as route runners and ball catchers, I think having two in the game at the same time could be good,” Richt said. “If it’s not for that, you’re really going to have one tailback blocking for another tailback. I’d just have one tailback in there and let a fullback block for a tailback.”Richt responds to high projections for GeorgiaIt didn’t take ESPN analyst Kirk Herbstreit very long.It’s been just one game, but he already has the No. 12 Bulldogs ranked as his No. 1 team for the College Football Playoff. Richt, however, was hesitant to buy into the hype surrounding Georgia’s impressive first win.“I think we’ve played one game and we’ve got a long way to go,” Richt said. “The old saying’s true, you’re probably never as good as you think and never as bad as you think … When you watch the film, there’s so much to correct and we’ve got to get better in a lot of areas or we could get exposed.”Georgia’s youth can make for an unpredictable outcome on any given Saturday, Richt pointed out. Now the young team, especially the young defense, will have to grasp for the maturity to handle the additional pressure of the national spotlight.


 


“I just think we’re really young in so many ways,” Richt said. “I don’t know how good we are, quite frankly. We had a good performance, we had one good game and even in that game there’s things that just need to be corrected. I’m not going to get too excited yet.”Despite struggles, Marshall’s knee is fineMarshall struggled in his limited carries and had a dropped pass. His struggles drew enough of a concern to have some tests done on his surgically repaired knee following the win over No. 16 Clemson.“He’s coming off an injury like that, and if there’s any little thing that gets tweaked sometimes you can wonder if something’s going on in there,” Richt said. “We’ve had a couple of tests to reassure that he’s fine. He’s good.”Marshall managed just eight yards on his six carries in the game and sat out for much of the second half in favor of the freshmen Chubb and Michel.",Cody Pace,sports,https://www.redandblack.com/sports/georgia-backfield-stacked-with-talent/article_5cac91e4-316e-11e4-8bd5-001a4bcf6878.html
1-Sep-14,"Todd Gurley, Amarlo Herrera earn SEC honors","The performances by Georgia junior tailback Todd Gurley and senior inside linebacker Amarlo Herrera in Saturday’s 45-21 win over No. 16 Clemson have earned the pair Southeastern Conference weekly honors.Gurley was named the co-offensive player of the week for the SEC, along with Texas A&M quarterback Kenny Hill, after rushing for a career high 198 yards, along with three rushing touchdowns on Saturday evening. Gurley also had a 100-yard kickoff return for a touchdown, which gave him a school record 293 all-purpose yards. The previous record, Rodney Hampton’s 290 all-purpose yards, has stood since 1987. This marks the second award Gurley has received for his performance against the Tigers after he was named the Walter Camp offensive player of the week on Sunday.Herrera earned the SEC defensive player of the week honors after tying his career-high in tackles with 12, his ninth career game with 10 or more tackles. Herrera also recorded two sacks and 3.5 tackles for loss while leading a Bulldogs defense that held the Clemson offense to 15 yards in the second half.

2-Sep-14,Practice Report: Malcolm Mitchell jogging at practice,"Returning to the field for the first time since Saturday’s 45-21 victory over Clemson, the Georgia Bulldogs football team took the field for its first practice of the bye week.The media was allowed 15 minutes of observation time. Here are the observations made by the Red & Black.· The most notable news to come from practice came from slightly off the practice field Tuesday. Junior wide receiver Malcolm Mitchell could be seen jogging on the turf field adjacent to the regular practice field. Mitchell was not in pads or with his usual unit – in fact he appeared to be blending in with the Georgia men’s basketball team workouts – but after not participating in Saturday’s game this use of mobility could be seen as a sign of improvement.


 


· In other injury news, the team appeared to be healthier than they had been in the offseason, with the only players of significance wearing non-contact green jerseys being senior wide receiver Chris Conley and sophomore tailback Brendan Douglas. Conley was held out of wide receiver blocking drills Tuesday, just as he had been during fall camp when he first began wearing a green jersey.· Staying with the wide receivers, freshman wide receiver Isaiah McKenzie appeared to be more vocal than he had been in the past during Tuesday’s practice. McKenzie, who carried one time for nine yards, caught two passes for 11 yards and returned one punt for 24 yards against Clemson, encouraged his teammates during a one-on-one blocking drill and enthusiastically jumped ahead of some teammates in line to take his turn. Most players turned a blind eye to McKenzie’s enthusiasm, but Conley, possibly sarcastically, told McKenzie that he should not do that and should wait his turn.· The offensive line did not deviate from its starting lineup Saturday when running drills in Tuesday’s practice. Just as was announced on last week’s depth chart and was seen during the Clemson game, Georgia’s offensive line consisted of junior John Theus at left tackle, sophomore Brandon Kublanow at left guard, senior David Andrews at center, redshirt sophomore Greg Pyke at right guard and senior Kolton Houston at right tackle.· In one final offensive note, though Georgia is on bye week, it doesn’t appear as if the scout team is treating the week as such. Freshman quarterback Jacob Park could be seen wearing a No. 17 jersey in practice, indicating that he will be taking the practice reps as South Carolina quarterback Dylan Thompson for two weeks in the Georgia scout team.· Not much out of the ordinary was shown on the defensive practice field Tuesday. Junior outside linebacker Jordan Jenkins appeared to be taking reps with the defensive linemen as opposed to the outside linebackers. As unusual as that may sound, defensive line coach Tracy Rocker’s job description does include coach strongside linebackers, so though Jenkins normally works with his position-mates under outside linebackers coach Kevin Sherrer, this isn’t a groundbreaking development.· As he has been all fall, defensive coordinator Jeremy Pruitt could be heard preaching fundamentals to his defensive backs during Tuesday’s practice. For as prolific as the Georgia defense was in their first game under Pruitt, the defensive backfield still did allow some long gains. If the 15-minute media observation period of practice is any indication, Pruitt attributes at least some of this fault to fundamental error.",Nick Suss,sports,https://www.redandblack.com/sports/practice-report-malcolm-mitchell-jogging-at-practice/article_7ade1348-32e7-11e4-b09a-0017a43b2370.html

2-Sep-14,Jell-O breaks into the tailgate experience with new UGA molds,"In an attempt to break into the market of football fans, Kraft Foods Group is building their Jell-O brand with the introduction of new university mold kits.In 2013, Jell-O launched mold kits in the shapes of iconic universities. The lucky four schools to have these creative gelatin molds were University of Arkansas, University of Florida, University of Texas and University of Michigan.The molds come with two trays and four packages of gelatin in the color of the university’s school color. The molds form the shapes of the universities’ logos and mascots. On the list of new university mold kits, include the University of Georgia with the shapes of the two logos, the Georgia “G” and the bulldog.


 


After a successful year, Jell-O introduced 16 other universities to their mold roster this August, including SEC rivals University of Alabama, Texas A & M University and Louisiana State University. “We are excited to fun up tailgates and viewing parties with our expanded line of University Mold Kits,” said Hermés Risien, Jell-O Brand Assistant at Kraft Foods. “College football fans will score a touchdown at their tailgates with these delicious Jell-O treats.”Similar to the popular strawberry Pop-Tarts embossed with the Georgia logo, Jell-O is tapping into fans' school spirit. Hoping as a way for fans to show their enthusiasm at tailgates, Jell-O is advertising their new mold kits through social media and on the game days.“We’re marketing the molds through social media channels, Facebook, Twitter, Google, Search, PR and on Amazon. And as part of the program, select fans at each school will have an opportunity to take home a mold kit on game day,” Risien said.The molds came be purchased for $5.99 at most grocery stores, retail stores and at on Amazon.com.“As we increase our Jell-O Jigglers University Mold Kit offerings from four schools last year to 20 schools this year, we hope to continue the popularity amongst our consumers and give fans across the country a great way to show their school spirit,” Risien said.","Alex Everhart

3-Sep-14,"Practice Report: John Theus wears non-contact jersey, rides stationary bike","No. 6 Georgia held its second practice of the bye week on Wednesday in full pads.The media was given access to two periods totaling 10 minutes. Here are some observations made by the Red & Black:· Junior left tackle John Theus was added to the ranks of injured Bulldogs donning green non-contact uniforms. Theus was separate from the rest of the offensive line, riding a bike as opposed to watching his unit practice. Senior receiver Chris Conley and sophomore running back Brendan Douglas wore green for the second straight day. Missing from practice were injured receivers Malcolm Mitchell, who ran at practice yesterday, and Justin Scott-Wesley.


 


· The defensive linemen started with a scoop-and-score drill where a coach rolled a medicine ball at them, simulating a low blocker, and then scooping a loose ball on the ground. For the second straight day, outside linebacker Jordan Jenkins participated in this drill with defensive line coach Tracy Rocker.· The outside linebackers worked with coach Kevin Sherrer on a strip drill. Players got in groups of three with one simulating the ball carrier, one trying to punch the ball out and the third trying to scoop up the loose ball. Going first as the puncher was freshman Lorenzo Carter, who ripped the ball out quickly. However, the drill was not cadenced at full-game speed, with the focus being much more on the technique of the strip.· When the second period rolled around, the inside linebackers worked on pushing a blocking sled with an enthusiastic inside linebacker coach Mike Ekeler. Senior Amarlo Herrera went first and drew praise from Ekeler. Sophomore Reggie Carter showed the most physical reps of the drill, driving the last dummy on the sled almost completely vertical.· Wide receivers worked an aggressive blocking drill for the second straight day. On his first rep of the drill, redshirt sophomore Blake Tibbs struggled with his hand placement and was thrown around by his partner, although he seemed much stronger on the second rep.

6-Sep-14,University Health Center hosts third non-alcoholic alternative tailgate,"When most people think of tailgating on gameday, they think of football, corn hole, burgers and an excessive amount of alcohol. However, more students at the University of Georgia are participating in a non-alcoholic tailgate.Last Saturday brought Bulldog football fans and UGA students together to witness a win against the Clemson University Tigers. Along with that came pre-game tailgating, a popular way to start off any college football gameday right.However, the tendency for people to get abuse alcohol and get drunk while tailgating is what started the UGA University Health Center’s alternative tailgating event back in 2012.


 


Danjuma Francis, a senior finance and advertising major from Smyrna, went to the UHC’s first tailgate and described it as a “good time.”“It was fun,” Francis said. “I played a lot of corn hole and talked to my friends. It was like a regular tailgate.”In past years, the tailgate event was held at the UHC with approximately 300 students present, a trend that continued to this year. The event provided barbecue from a local restaurant and several games, music and giveaways, all of which were free for students.Liz Prince, the associate director for health promotion at the UHC, reports there were even more games than last year, and probably more than any other tailgate on campus, because they partnered with the Ramsey Student Center, which provided a lot of the activities.However, the alcohol-free gameday did not end there. After the tailgate was over, the event moved to the Tate Student Center, where students could watch the game and eat food brought by the UHC, which Prince said provided a safer environment for students to celebrate gameday.“We have a spectrum of students who engage in different activities,” Prince said. “I am sure that some students take it too far, and I’m sure that there are many that stay safe.”Kathryn Craw, a sophomore biology major from Augusta, said there are other benefits to the UHC tailgate besides being non-alcoholic.“There’s drinking on game day, but I think if there’s free food and games, people will be there, regardless of the alcohol policy,” she said.


 


Those that decide to celebrate by drinking should always be aware of the dangers of consuming alcohol, especially on as hot of days like last Saturday. Prince said gameday participants run the risk of dehydration whether students are drinking or not.“It’s not even drinking too much. I think any amount of alcohol on a day where it’s really hot out, it can dehydrate the body,” she said. “If you’re not replenishing the fluids, even if you’re not drinking alcohol, you’re losing fluids because of the heat.”Prince said some students take it too far when it comes to drinking alcohol before football games.“We also know that sometimes folks will bypass eating to counter the calories for the alcohol. Then you go into the stadium, and you’re crammed in with 90,000 other people, which makes it hotter in the stadium than it is outside of it if you think about it. So that definitely raises the risk,” she said. “The more alcohol you consume, the more body fluids you’re going to lose.”",Katelyn Umholtz @Kumh0ltz,uganews,https://www.redandblack.com/uganews/university-health-center-hosts-third-non-alcoholic-alternative-tailgate/article_b3955d08-347d-11e4-bb1b-001a4bcf6878.html
7-Sep-14,Letter to the Editor: Government intervention needed to combat impending student debt,"Student loans are an undeniable aspect of the modern college experience. As more students enter every year, tuition skyrockets. Almost every millenial is now burdened by a debt they are unlikely to pay back until their early 30s.According to the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, total student debt is $1.1 trillion and the average borrower holds around $25,000 in debt, regardless of age cohort, as of 2013. Additionally, 60 percent of students borrow annually to cover education costs, as reported by the Chronicle of Higher Education. Essentially, the average person with student debt holds the value of a down payment on a house or a new midsize sedan in IOU’s.Even those without debt pay for the transgressions of their peers. One's future well-being is as much about your financial stability as it is about your neighbor’s. For example, a young, financially fit person goes through all four years of school debt free. Their dream is to open a fashion boutique. They save some cash, borrow a little and open up a nice place downtown. They market to the young professionals whom they assume will have expendable income and an appetite for hip clothes.  They're probably right about their trendiness, but maybe not so much about their expendable income.


 


If we use the previous statistics, and ignore many other variables the boutique's customer base may contain, we could assume 60 percent of the customers (young adults with college degrees) will have some form of debt, and on average that debt will total $25,000. If that 60 percent of the projected customer base is making $300-$400 monthly payments on their loans, they will have much less money to blow on trendy clothes.In a wider perspective, borrowers will have less money for clothes, going out to eat, going on trips, car payments and may push off buying a house for years. The automotive and housing industries specifically have always run the wheels of American business and progress. These trades employ millions of people from top to bottom, loggers to real estate agents. These industries depend on American consumer’s ability to spend, and the American economy depends on these industries. If these borrowers are spending thousands of dollars toward just paying back what they owe, the entire economy drags. Their educations have become inflated and necessary, but they have to spend years spending their “extra cash” on debt. This applies to all students,  regardless of whether they borrowed money themselves.Obama has ordered “comprehensive” debt reforms that only band-aid the issue and ignore the core ailment. Student still must pay chunks of income during some of their most ""spend happy"" years. It remains a drain on the economy.A solution rife with controversy and moral hazard could be to completely forgive all federally apportioned student loans. The government can simply re-subsidize all of their guaranteed loans with a “people’s bailout”. They could use federal funds to pay back all of the loans they’ve guaranteed. The country as a whole would gain when the indebted become more productive members of the consumer base. There would be a reset button pressed and people would buy again in a highly consumption-based economy.This may not be equitable to everyone, especially those who borrowed less and worked hard to stay out of debt, but it will benefit everyone in the long run.  In a day and age where a federal government spends $700 billion on distressed assets in private bail outs, it would at least make equal sense to bail out a distressed populace. Both borrowers and non-borrowers win.—Bradley Bacon is a senior from Grayson majoring in economics",Bradley Bacon,views,https://www.redandblack.com/views/letter-to-the-editor-government-intervention-needed-to-combat-impending/article_f8cb20cc-36c8-11e4-b864-001a4bcf6878.html
8-Sep-14,Former walk-on Taylor Maxey blocking the way for Georgia backfield,"As was said during ESPN’s broadcast of the Georgia versus Clemson game, Todd Gurley only needed one block to score on his 100-yard kickoff return touchdown.For Taylor Maxey, the man who made that one block, the only thing going through his head was not to look silly as Gurley whizzed by.“I didn’t know he was bringing it out actually,” Maxey said. “We got lined up and I heard the go call and I was kind of surprised by it. He just went and all of the sudden he hits me from the back. I’m just happy I didn’t fall down on national TV.”


 


A senior fullback from Statham, Maxey went from little known walk-on linebacker to starting fullback in four years at Georgia, a process that took a lot of circumstantial help.Last season, Maxey was an afterthought, a third-string fullback stuck behind a reliable Merritt Hall and a big-play fullback in Quayvon Hicks. But after Hicks moved to tight end in the spring and Hall received a medical disqualification in the fall for concussion-related complications, Maxey was thrust into the starting lineup, a place where he thrived in his first opportunity.“He’s done a great job,” sophomore guard Greg Pyke said of Maxey. “We were watching on film and two Saturdays ago he was opening up holes, he was making our job easier too.”Four years ago, Maxey was known more for clogging holes than opening them up. Though Maxey spent the last two years of his Georgia career creating lanes for Gurley and the rest of the Georgia backs in practice, in high school Maxey primarily cut off those lanes as a softly-recruited linebacker.Maxey said that he received scholarship offers from many smaller schools to play linebacker, most notably the FCS school Wofford and “a bunch of small schools up and down the northeast.” When Maxey walked on at Georgia, it was only natural he continue to play the position he knew best.However, offensive coordinator Mike Bobo said he noticed some traits in Maxey that could easily be transferred to fullback.“He was a guy that came in as a linebacker from North Oconee and when he was on scout team, he was a linebacker and he wasn’t afraid to put his hat on anybody,” Bobo said. “He was very physical and always looking for guys.”That physicality transitioned into Maxey playing a key role in Georgia’s ability to run the ball with ease against Clemson in the team’s season opener. Maxey was on the field not only for Gurley’s 100-yard kickoff return, but also made one of the key blocks on a toss sweep play Gurley scored on as well.


 


Though the play looks on film as if it were executed to perfection, Maxey said that that play was more of an improvisational, reactionary play for him than it may have appeared.“It was just a toss sweep,” Maxey said. “I just kept working up. [Center David Andrews] actually took my guy and I just kept going and then somebody showed up and I knocked him down.”This is not abnormal for Maxey, a player who both his coaches and teammates alike describe as “hard-nosed.”“He’s definitely one of those old-school guys,” Pyke said. “He does a great job on all of his assignments. He just likes to go out there and hit people. He’s not scared to put his helmet in there and as you saw in the Clemson game he was cutting people left and right.”The natural question to be asked on Maxey with how he has performed in practice and his limited game experience is why then would a player so well received choose to walk on at Georgia over play at a smaller level school.For Maxey, the question was simple to answer: His family heritage led him to Athens.Maxey said his parents, grandparents, aunts and uncles are all Georgia alums, and Georgia Bulldogs football was something he was exposed to from a very young age.“Our whole basement is Georgia themed,” Maxey said. “All my friends’ basements were Georgia themed. I’ve been around it a lot. There’s a bunch of G’s in my life.”

This fact made Maxey’s decision easy.“I was always Georgia,” Maxey said. “I was coming to Georgia no matter what.""",Nick Suss,sports,https://www.redandblack.com/sports/former-walk-on-taylor-maxey-blocking-the-way-for-georgia/article_79256ee8-37ba-11e4-9cfa-0017a43b2370.html
11-Sep-14,Football notebook: Hutson Mason whispers calls to prepare team for Saturday's environment,"The Georgia football team has taken a unique approach to preparing for the noise that it will have to handle at Williams-Brice Stadium on Saturday.Instead of heading over to Sanford stadium and blaring music through the speakers, the coaches are using a speaker system and having senior quarterback Hutson Mason whisper his calls.“They’ve got these nice, big, expensive Bose speakers that we’ve been using to play some music,” junior left tackle John Theus said. “Hutson’s been talking quietly rather than calling out the play loud so we really have to zone in, focus and focus in on what he’s saying and relay it down the line in order to get the call.”


 


It’s not just any song either. “Sandstorm,” the song that haunted the Bulldogs’ last trip to Columbia, South Carolina has been blaring over those Bose speakers to prepare for the ad nauseam playing of the song on Saturday, although not everybody is hating the song choice.“I kinda like the song a little,” junior outside linebacker Jordan Jenkins said. “When they played it during the game, I was like, ‘Shoot, this is getting me hyped, I don’t know why they keep playing it.’”Jenkins also pointed out that it could be worse.“It doesn’t bother me as much as Rocky Top does,” Jenkins said.Theus glad to see Clowney goneAfter handling Clemson senior defensive end Vic Beasley pretty well week one, Theus is glad that former Gamecock Jadeveon Clowney has moved on to the NFL.But that doesn’t mean he can relax on Saturday.“[Clowney is] a freak and he’s a great player but I mean, South Carolina’s always going to replace what they have,” Theus said. “They recruit well and they always have players that play tough and play hard … We know Clowney’s not over there but they’ve got some guys that can play.”


 


Theus had a pretty solid game against one of college football’s premier pass rushers in Beasley, holding him to just one sack that came on a botched snap. However, Richt acknowledged that a good game against Beasley won’t translate to every pass rusher Theus faces.“I think he’s putting in the work to continue to improve and then every week’s a different challenge,” Richt said. “You might have a guy that’s just a jet coming off the edge that you may handle well and the next day you might have a guy just is a big bull rusher and you don’t do as well as that guy.”Theus had a small ankle and knee injury at the end of the bye week after he was “rolled up on” in practice. However, Theus says that he’s 100 percent and ready to go for South Carolina.“[Clemson is] a long time ago now that I’m thinking about it,” Theus said. “I think I did alright but I’ve got a lot of things to improve on and I’ve been trying to improve on this past week for South Carolina.”Quick hits· 317 pound junior nosetackle Chris Mayes is expected to travel with the team to Columbia and should play, according to Richt. Mayes was dinged up and did not play against Clemson, but Richt said “he’ll be ready to go.”· Redshirt freshman safety Tramel Terry is expected to travel to Columbia as well. Terry, a South Carolina native, had a lot of hype surrounding him during spring practice but has been mostly quiet since the start of the fall.· Richt was noncommittal on the status of junior college transfer Shattle Fenteng. Fenteng has dealt with a shoulder injury that Richt says has prevented him from competing. “If he was 100 percent healthy would he be playing or starting? I wouldn’t say that, but I’d say it’s keeping him from being in position to do that,” Richt said.

From Marietta to Liberia, here is a brief roundup of what international stories made headlines this week.1. ISISMore troops in the Middle East: U.S. President Barack Obama announced in his speech on Wednesday night that he would be sending 475 more troops to Iraq to fight back against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) militants. The troops will arm, advise and train opposition forces against the terrorist group. Deployment will begin within the next week, bringing up the total number of America troops in the Middle East to about 1,600.


 


2. Ray RiceConflicting stories: The questions behind the National Football League's knowledge of Ray Rice hitting his fiancée, who is now his wife, have yet to be answered. Hours after TMZ released the elevator video of the February incident on Monday, the Baltimore Ravens terminated Rice's contract. NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell announced Rice's indefinite suspension from the league shortly after. The NFL says it was unaware of the elevator video prior to this week. The Associated Press reports that the NFL received a copy of the video in April. Former FBI Director Robert S. Mueller III is conducting an investigation as to how the league gathered its information.3. Oscar PistoriusJudge delivers verdict: Oscar Pistorius was found guilty of culpable homicide, a charge equal to manslaughter, on Friday. Pistorius, 27, has been on trial since March 2013 for the shooting death of his girlfriend in February. The judge presiding over Pistorius' case cleared him of the two murder charges on Thursday. Pistorius fired into a locked bathroom in his South African villa, where his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp, 29, became the victim of his bullet. He is out on bail and awaits his sentencing hearings, which begin Oct. 13.4. Atlanta HawksRacially charged emails: Atlanta Hawks owner Bruce Levenson is selling his share in the NBA team after sending an email that faulted the crowd for low sales from the basketball games. In the email sent in 2012, Levenson said, ""My theory is that the black crowd scared away the whites and there are simply not enough affluent black fans to build a significant season ticket base."" Local officials have expressed their disappointment in Levenson's comments but have commended the owner for his decision.5.

12-Sep-14,Scouting the enemy: Georgia could be in for big day against South Carolina secondary,"There probably isn’t a South Carolina football fan in the world who wants to revisit the team’s season-opening loss to Texas A&M. To put it nicely, it was brutal. But as a matter of analysis, that game does provide troves of insight into what South Carolina’s offensive and defensive strengths and weaknesses are. With Georgia’s Southeastern Conference opening bout against the Gamecocks now just one day away, this is the right time to revisit the tape and see what can be learned.(Full Disclosure: South Carolina is 1-1, as it followed the loss to Texas A&M with a win over East Carolina. However, due to the relative difficulty to find the tape of the ECU game online for free, combined with the disparity in talent between the two teams being less comparable than that of Georgia and Texas A&M, the tape for that game has not been evaluated in this scouting report.)Defense


 


Sometimes box scores lie and stats sheets are deceptive. South Carolina’s 52-28 loss to the Aggies was not one of them. Teams that give up 680 yards of total offense rarely are successful and the Gamecocks were no exception on the season’s opening day. However, much of Texas A&M’s success can be attributed to schematic difficulties on the part of the South Carolina defense.The Gamecocks operated for the most part out of a base 3-3-5 Under defense against Texas A&M. In effect, this means that the Gamecocks used three down linemen, three linebackers and five defensive backs to counteract their opponent’s spread offense. The “Under” in 3-3-5 means that the three linebackers lined up with two traditional inside linebackers and one outside linebacker with the outside linebacker lining up in an upright position on the line of scrimmage on the short side of the field. When Texas A&M deviated from its base offense and tightened it up, South Carolina condensed its defense into a more conventional 3-4 defense.However, the weakness of the South Carolina 3-3-5 Under sat not in its front six so much as it did in the secondary. Throughout the entire first half, Texas A&M took advantage of South Carolina’s alignment in the defensive backfield. While the boundary corner, or the cornerback lined up on the short side of the field, often pressed up close to the receiver, all of the corners on the long side of the field spent most of the game with around 8 yards of cushion between them and the receiver.Noticing this, Texas A&M ran a nifty combination of plays that gave South Carolina fits. This combination had three options, all of which the Aggies ran to perfection on their first drive of the second quarter. Lined up in a formation with three wide receivers on the long side of the field and a running back offset from the quarterback, all three of these plays exposed a South Carolina weakness. The first option was a simple handoff across the formation to the running back off tackle, a play that ate up chunks of yards due to the thin nature of South Carolina’s interior when receivers are spreading the field. The second option is a play-action to the running back leading to a quick swing route to a slot receiver on the long side of the field with the other two receivers blocking for him, a play that proved to be South Carolina’s kryptonite time and again. Finally, once the Gamecocks adjusted to the second option, Texas A&M would fake the handoff, fake the swing, then find a slot receiver downfield on a skinny post for a 20-yard gain.This tells us two things about the South Carolina defense pertaining to its game against Georgia. First, it is likely that South Carolina will be working to prevent this combination from happening again, mostly because Georgia’s offense under senior quarterback Hutson Mason thrives in rhythm-passing situations. This was partially the reason that Mason posted just a 5.04 yards per attempt average against Clemson; when many passes are thrown behind or near the line of scrimmage, it is harder to gain yards. Secondly, Georgia can learn that when South Carolina is spread thin, it is susceptible to Georgia’s two greatest strengths, quick pass routes and off-tackle runs. Based off of Texas A&M’s gameplan, expect Georgia to run many three wide receiver sets to try to open up running lanes for Todd Gurley and company.OffenseThe player that most people want to talk about is tailback Mike Davis. While it is unquestionable that Davis is the Gamecocks’ star, it is tough to label him as more important to the South Carolina offense than quarterback Dylan Thompson or the team’s offensive line.Everything that needs to be said about South Carolina’s offense, both positive and negative, can be seen at the 3:44 mark in the first quarter of South Carolina’s game against Texas A&M. On this play, Thompson lofted a 69-yard touchdown to wide receiver Nick Jones to bring the score to a then-respectable 10-7.


 


Three main things happen on this play: South Carolina reveals the formation Thompson is most comfortable in, the offensive line provides enough protection and Thompson exercises his “gunslinger” mentality.Formationally, it is worth mentioning that up to this point South Carolina had yet to run a play from under center, favoring instead shotgun plays. This is a strategy South Carolina will likely employ against Georgia as well out of respect for the Bulldog pass rush.On the offensive line, South Carolina is nationally-known for its size and has the reputation of being a stout pass-protecting bunch. This play was no exception. Though Thompson was rushed toward the end of the play, the unit continued to hold its blocks, allowing Thompson to see the play develop.However, Thompson made this play what it was by refusing to accept what he should have accepted. The down and distance was third-and-four and South Carolina was trailing by 10 points. Texas A&M allowed South Carolina’s receivers 8 yards of cushion and two of South Carolina’s receivers accepted it, cutting of their routes at five yards and sitting open on the left side of the field for easy first downs. Noticing this, Thompson checks his head briefly in their direction before deciding to check back elsewhere. While this was happening, Jones was streaking through the back end of the Texas A&M secondary with just one player to beat. Rather than turning back and making the easy throw, Thompson slung the ball downfield in Jones’ direction, nearly overthrowing him but barely connecting for the team’s first score.When relating to Georgia, this exchange is key. Georgia’s secondary is definitely the weak point of its defense, and if South Carolina’s offensive line can give Thompson time, players will get open just as Jones did on this play. Furthermore, players such as Jones are considerably quicker than Clemson’s receivers were and as such, present a concern as deep threats even though Clemson was able to, in the first half, take advantage of Georgia in the deep game anyway.However, this also does showcase Thompson’s stubbornness. As he did on this play, he has a tendency to stare down receivers and go to the route he chose pre-snap, something that Georgia can use to its advantage if it can learn to read his eyes. If not, Thompson’s strong arm very likely will be able to carve through inexperienced members of the Georgia secondary like cornerback Devin Bowman, safety Aaron Davis and star Dominick Sanders",Nick Suss,sports,https://www.redandblack.com/sports/scouting-the-enemy-georgia-could-be-in-for-big-day/article_f35c20bc-3a99-11e4-a261-001a4bcf6878.html
12-Sep-14,Edges: Georgia football holds slight edge over South Carolina in all facets of game,"OffenseOn paper, the Georgia and South Carolina football teams should be very similar on offense.Both teams run a more pro-style offense based off of the ground-and-pound run game and have quarterbacks that manage the game and don’t take too many chances down field.


 


Gamecocks quarterback Dylan Thompson has thrown nearly 40 passes a game but averages just 4.6 yards per attempt, which is less than Georgia quarterback Hutson Mason’s 5 yards per attempt against Clemson even though the Bulldogs were criticized for being too conservative in the pass game.Both teams also have multiple-pronged rushing attacks. The South Carolina tandem of Mike Davis and Brandon Wilds has averaged 121 yards per game and 4 yards per carry, but only has two touchdowns in two games. Georgia, on the other hand, had three touchdowns alone from junior running back Todd Gurley and amassed five touchdowns and 328 yards on the ground against Clemson.With an average weight of starting offensive linemen at 314 pounds, the Gamecocks shouldn’t have any problems punching the ball in, but its lack rushing touchdowns and the fact that they are just 9-for-22 on third down gives Georgia the edge.Slight edge: GeorgiaDefenseTo say South Carolina’s defense has been bad is an understatement.The Gamecock secondary allowed 511 yards to a previously unknown quarterback Kenny Hill from Texas A&M and followed that performance up with another 321 yards to East Carolina.The fact that they’re allowing so many yards through the air, it’s fair so say that they’re only allowing 150 yards per game on the ground, which isn’t good either.


 


So this should be an easy edge to Georgia, except it’s not quite that obvious.The question surrounding Georgia’s defense is which defense shows up throughout the season. Is it the seemingly lost defense of the first half of the Clemson game or is it the defense that allowed just 15 yards in the second half? Realistically, the answer probably lies somewhere in between, but because of the uncertainty, I’ll only give Georgia slight edge.Slight edge: GeorgiaCoachingIt’s hard not to like Steve Spurrier.While his on-the-field antics can be annoying and sometimes whiney, his aloof and seemingly senile disposition liken Spurrier to that one crazy grandpa that almost everyone has.When Spurrier walks into an interview, the level of uncertainty about what the “Head Ball Coach” might say creates an entertaining atmosphere compared to that of the typical boring head coach of a major school.But that doesn’t make him a better coach.

Spurrier has had his fair share of success at South Carolina, but not compared to that of Richt. South Carolina may have had Georgia’s number in the matchup recently, but Richt has the advantage when looking at his entire tenure and his team has certainly performed better this season, albeit in a small sample size.Slight edge: Georgia",Cody Pace,sports,https://www.redandblack.com/sports/edges-georgia-football-holds-slight-edge-over-south-carolina-in/article_08f53682-3a1f-11e4-9671-0017a43b2370.html
14-Sep-14,U.S. lacking in foreign language education,"Learning a foreign language can be one of the most difficult tasks in a person’s life. Whether it be in academia or just for fun, being introduced to a new language can be incredibly daunting for some people.In the U.S. 25 to 31 percent are exposed to languages in elementary school, acoording to a 2008 study by About World Languages. I remember having one day a month, or even less, where a Spanish “teacher” would come into class and teach us to count to ten and end the lesson with a song. Sadly, this did not help me become bilingual, and I now can only hope to master a language besides English.While there are certainly a large number of people who do  break the language barrierin the U.S., foreign countries far surpass foreign language standards. it is important for us to look at other regions of the world that teach English or other languages at a younger age and how such a large proportion are essentially fluent in English.


 


For instance, German students begin to study a foreign language in grade school and continue their studies through high school, depending on which their academic track. Western Europe has given its students a great advantage not only academically, but also with regards to the job market. Several careers nowadays require the ability to speak a foreign language as part of a job description. Hence, the U.S. greatly lags behind much of the world in language education and something must be done about it for the U.S. to continue competeting in an expanding global market.“Just 18 percent of Americans report speaking a language other than English. That’s far short of Europe, where 53 percent of citizens speak more than one language.” said Arne Duncan, current Secretary of Education of the United States.This statistic is eye-opening as Duncan claims the reason this gap exists is the lack of quality and professional language education starting from an early age. There are simply not enough teachers around the country to fill the positions needed to have a substantial increase in language learning.The Obama administration, along with Duncan, hope to shrink the gap as soon as possible through government funding and federal student loan reform for language studies. This will ensure teacher positions wil be filled and students will have access to higher levels of language learning.To put it simply, the U.S. needs to understand foreign languages are an important role in the continued growth of the country in many aspects. The way we go about learning a language is, along with the lack of professional teachers, the reason we trail so far behind so many. We cannot continue to think that English is the only language needed in the world we live in. We most certainly cannot assume everyone else around the world will learn English, as we will fall behind.Secretary Duncan sums it up best, “Our country needs to create a future in which all Americans understand that by speaking more than one language, they are enabling our country to compete successfully and work collaboratively with partners across the globe.” — Zach Hawkins is a Junior from Peachtree City majoring in International Affairs",Zach Hawkins,views,https://www.redandblack.com/views/u-s-lacking-in-foreign-language-education/article_5c7f4b9e-3867-11e4-a662-0017a43b2370.html
14-Sep-14,Georgia volleyball loses two close matches to Harvard and NC State,"The Bulldogs suffered two heartbreaking losses to Harvard and NC State to close out the Benson Hospitality tournament, and walk away 5-4 on the season.The Bulldogs lost 3-1 to the Harvard Crimson in the first match and 3-1 to the North Carolina State Wolfpack in the second, with nearly every set a close battle decided in the last few moments.“We need to be tougher at the end of matches,” coach Lizzy Stemke said. “It’s not something that comes overnight, but we need to be in these situations and we need to battle.”


 


And battle the Bulldogs did. Although they came up short, it’s still early in the season as the team fights to see the fruits of its labor.“We need to get past one of these situations with a ‘W’ to realize how hard we’re working will pay off,” Stemke said.In the first set against Harvard, Georgia jumped out to a 6-3 lead which they maintained for most of the set thanks to multiple kills by middle blockers Desiree McCray and Jasmine Eatmon. The Bulldogs lost an 18-11 lead and Harvard battled back for to pull within two at 23-21. After a kill by McCray made it set point, another kill by Lauren Teknipp sealed the win 25-23.Leading the series 1-0, the Crimson and Bulldogs were gridlocked for much of the second set, with the biggest lead of the game coming from kills by Teknipp and Eatmon to put the Bulldogs up 13-10. But the teams remained neck-and-neck for the rest of the set, with tied scores of 21-21 and 23-23 occurring before Harvard took the set 25-23. The third set was more of the same, with Georgia dropping leads of 7-3, 11-4 and 20-17 to ultimately lose 25-23.In the fourth set, the Crimson jumped out to an 8-3 lead and maintained their lead throughout the set. Fighting to get out of a 20-14 deficit, a kill and back-to-back blocks by Eatmon and setter Kaylee Kehoe put the Bulldogs within three at 20-17, but Harvard’s offense pulled away with a 25-21 win to win 3-1.Freshman libero Cassidy Anderson, who added four aces on the game, mentioned that she is still adjusting to the differences between collegiate and high school volleyball.“The game is so fast, that you don’t have time to react,” Anderson said. “You just have to know. So going to practice every single day and training for that fast pace is going to help me.”Georgia repeated the same pattern in the second match of the day against NC State, with formidable performances faltering later in the sets.


 


Although the Bulldogs jumped out to a 5-1 lead, the Wolfpack responded and tied the game 6-6. The game stayed close, with another tied score occurring at 12-12. NC State rallied to narrow the margin to 16-19, but a Bulldog offense, including outside hitter Amanda Dachs who led the team with 16 kills and hit at .484, proved overwhelming as Georgia took the first set 25-20.The second set followed suit as an incredibly close set in its entirety, but even though Georgia had a late 20-19 lead, the Wolfpack showed poise and again quieted the Bulldogs 25-23. In the third set, the teams again went kill-for-kill until NC State pulled away for a 25-21 win.The fourth set between the Bulldogs and the Wolfpack went point-for-point down to the very end, with NC State clinching a 31-29 win despite scrappy blocking by McCray and Eatmon.Senior libero Gaby Smiley, who had 24 digs on the game, mentioned that the deficits the Bulldogs faced, especially late in many sets, gave them too big of a barrier to overcome.“We’re getting ourselves in really tight situations,” Smiley said. “We’ve just gotta learn how to hammer it down at the end and finish the game.”But these losses come on the cusp of hard work paying off, said Stemke, as the Bulldogs strive for consistency.“We know we’re really close,” Stemke said. “It’s one or two plays at the end of the match. We can’t linger on the losses. We need to focus on the play, the effort, and that when you continue to keep fighting and put in that effort, the chances are, it’s going to swing your way at some point.",Sarah Spencer,sports,https://www.redandblack.com/sports/georgia-volleyball-loses-two-close-matches-to-harvard-and-nc/article_944da040-3c1b-11e4-af33-001a4bcf6878.html

The app is downloadable from Google Play and iTunes.Natalie Swords, a junior criminal justice from Canton, said she thinks the updated app is useful when on campus.


 


“I actually use it because it’s pretty helpful, especially for buses late at night when you want to make sure you stay safe and you know when the next bus is,” she said. “I think it will help out having the app available to a variety of phones because you can’t just be iPhone-friendly.”Additional features include schedules for sporting events, access to your student account for paying bills, a directory of contact information for faculty and students and locations of computer labs, parking decks print kiosks and bike repair stations, according to a press release.“The UGA mobile app will make the literal and figurative navigation of campus much easier,” said Jim Thompson, vice president of the UGA Student Government Association, in the release. “With the bus tracking feature, students using Campus Transit can get to their classes easier. The quick access to many UGA online resources on the mobile app is also efficient for students.”The mobile app comes from a collaboration of SGA and UGA’s Enterprise Information Technology Services, according to the release.Additional campus partners who helped develop the app include UGA Auxiliary Services, the Athletic Association, the Office of the Vice President for Institution, the Office of the Vice President for Student Affairs, the Office of Sustainability, the Office of Emergency Preparedness, Public Affairs, Career Center, Admissions Office, Registrar’s Office and Designated Dawgs.“If you're visiting, learning, teaching or working on the campus at UGA, the official mobile app is a must-have for anyone with a mobile device,” said Lance Peiper, manager of the mobile technology group for EITS, in the release. “With the mobile app on your phone, you can see when the next bus arrives near you, easily find buildings on campus and decide which at dining commons to eat your next meal.”",Laura James @laurajames225,uganews,https://www.redandblack.com/uganews/sga-uga-launch-app-for-android-users-update-ios-version/article_4e2b07e6-3df2-11e4-ac9d-001a4bcf6878.html
17-Sep-14,Georgia volleyball looks to recover from tough weekend losses,"After two back-to-back close losses to Harvard and NC State, The Georgia volleyball team looks to bounce back at the Georgia Tech Invitational in Atlanta this weekend.In addition to facing in-state rival Georgia Tech, Georgia will also play Southern Mississippi and Alabama A&M.This game against Georgia Tech catches the Bulldogs at an interesting point in the season, as the team has struggled to hit stride and is battling with unforced errors and digging itself into deficits.


 


Georgia has been in transition since coach Lizzy Stemke’s arrival. After two rebuilding years, the Bulldogs posted a 22-10 record last season, its best record since 1994, and made it to the first round of the NCAA volleyball tournament.However, they have yet to get over the hump and find consistency in the offensive and defensive components of the game simultaneously.This week, the team is focusing on transitions, or the smooth change from defense to offense.“We’ve been focusing a lot on our defense and transition game,” Stemke said. “We’re blocking a lot of balls and digging a lot of balls but we need to make sure our transition attack is efficient and that we’ve got the dig-to-kill mentality.”Georgia has lost 1-3, 0-3 and 2-3 the last three times it faced off against the Yellow Jackets.But according to Stemke, it’s a matter of time before the Bulldogs’ hard work pays off against a tough opponent.“We’ve got the talent to fight through it,” Stemke said. “We just need to continue to build confidence in our practice gym to know that our time is coming.”In the two losses last weekend, the Bulldogs did not have a poor performance. Outside hitter Amanda Dachs had 16 kills and hit at .484 percentage against NC State. In the same game, middle blocker Desiree McCray had three impressive solo blocks. Against Harvard, freshman Cassidy Anderson posted four aces.


 


But against both teams, the Bulldogs stumbled toward the end of matches, or had to battle back from moderate deficits such as 3-8 and 6-14 against Harvard instead of focusing on extending a lead.Middle blocker Jasmine Eatmon said she focused on learning from the team’s mistakes before this weekend.“We’re moving on very fast,” Eatmon said. “It’s helpful that we have to fix minor things instead of major things so that way during the season we don’t have to taper or go backwards. We’re actually moving forwards.”And with Southeastern Conference play fast approaching, in which the Bulldogs will face three nationally-ranked teams in Florida, Kentucky and Texas A&M, this weekend poses an opportunity to continue ironing out any difficulties.Outside hitter Tirah Le’au said her role as a senior is to make sure all her teammates are on the same page despite some discouraging losses.“We all need to look at the bigger picture,” Le’au said. “Success will come, and it comes with time. And unfortunately we do have to take some losses to gain some wins.”",Sarah Spencer,sports,https://www.redandblack.com/sports/georgia-volleyball-looks-to-recover-from-tough-weekend-losses/article_d92258fc-3e0d-11e4-9c2e-0017a43b2370.html
18-Sep-14,Lack of gender diversity lead to Rice's lenient punishment,"The NFL’s decision to suspend Ray Rice for only two games for domestic violence took a turn for the worse. New footage of Rice knocking his wife unconscious in a casino elevator put more pressure on the NFL to act. The public outcry against the lenient penalties has resulted in Rice getting cut from the Ravens and suspended indefinitely from the league and many people calling for the resignation of NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell.Some people believe that the Rice punishment was too harsh, however the indefinite suspension was the only appropriate action that the league could have taken. It should not have taken so long to get to that point, however. This tricky situation in which the NFL finds itself was entirely avoidable, but was not due to a lack of diversity within the NFL front office.The NFL front office is responsible for all player and executive discipline for teams within the league. An overwhelming majority of executives in the NFL front office consists of white males over the age of 45. These men make a combined $ 89.4 million annually for their roles as executives. They come from very rich backgrounds like Goodell’s as a son of a former United States senator. This forms a sort of hive-mind of older white men in NFL decision-making.


 


The lack of diversity, specifically gender diversity, no doubt contributed to the NFL’s mild punishment. When you have multiple people with the same background and same status in society, it is not crazy to believe that they might come to a similar conclusion. The lack of women meant that the NFL had no one who could relate to the situation in the room. They made a swift judgment hoping that it would go away because they did not have the ability as a group to accurately determine the horrific nature of the crime which Rice committed.These men were far more concerned with having a star player like Rice on the field than the possible message which they were sending to the country. The financially-motivated nature of the NFL was responsible for the shortsighted nature of the suspension. Ironically enough, the public outcry as a result of the weak suspension will cost the NFL more from a business and public relations standpoint than not having Rice play in the first place.In a sport that has been maligned for its caveman-like nature over the past few years with issues such as concussions, the Rice decision further adds to the criticism. The NFL should make a conscious effort to include more diversity of opinion and background in its front office because it would allow them to tackle these social issues with more appropriate responses. From a more practical standpoint, it would help them avoid media firestorms such as the one it has faced with the Rice case.After the Rice debacle, the NFL has established that first-time offenders in domestic violence cases will receive a six game suspension and second-time offenders will receive a lifetime ban. This is a policy that was created reactively. More diversity amongst the people making these high profile decisions would lead to the NFL making better, more proactive decisions in the future.

19-Sep-14,"Georgia athletic board approves $400,000 design study for indoor practice facility","An indoor practice facility could be coming to Georgia in the near future.The University of Georgia athletic board approved a $400,000 request for a design study of the facility at its Board of Directors meeting on Friday.No timetable has been set on the project, but after little discussion amongst board members, the money was approved to begin designing a conceptual idea of the project as well as the most feasible location for the facility.


 


“I just think it was something that will benefit our whole program,” Georgia athletic director Greg McGarity said.McGarity believes that the most viable locations for the facility are around the Butts-Mehre building, where the football team usually practices, and the softball facility, which is located on Milledge Avenue.The track outside Butts-Mehre will most likely stay put as McGarity said moving it to Milledge would “quadruple” the cost of the project.The architecture for the facility is yet to begin, but will be larger than a football field–53 yards wide and 120 yards long- and about 75-100 feet tall.“You’ve got to have enough room off the sides of the field so you don’t run into a brick wall,” McGarity said. “So obviously you want to design it with as much leeway as you can so you don’t hurt yourself.”Fundraising will be a key element of the project, but McGarity could not give an estimated cost of the facility, as a lot of the price will be determined by its location. Georgia Tech, Clemson and Auburn, who all recently built indoor practice facilities, spent around $15 million.Georgia and Florida are the only schools in the Southeastern Conference that don’t have indoor practice facilities. The Bulldogs football team does have an indoor practice field that is about half the size of the projected facility, but it’s only used for walkthroughs or when lightning is in the area.This subject has been highly discussed in the last couple years, but McGarity claims that this decision was not made due to public pressure. Blueprints of the facility and location are set to be ready for February when the next board meeting takes place.


 


“I might be moving to quick here as far as February, but we are going to get the process started and get this thing moving,” McGarity said.",Connor Smolensky,sports,https://www.redandblack.com/sports/georgia-athletic-board-approves-design-study-for-indoor-practice-facility/article_e0dbcd4c-404e-11e4-90b1-001a4bcf6878.html
19-Sep-14,"Freshmen Michel, McKenzie making plays together","It took only two plays for the Bulldogs to find the end zone on the opening drive of last Saturday’s tilt with South Carolina, and both calls involved Isaiah McKenzie and Sony Michel.On the No. 13 Bulldogs’ first offensive play, Georgia (1-1, 0-1 Southeastern Conference) senior quarterback Hutson Mason faked a handoff to running back Todd Gurley and completed a 36-yard pass to McKenzie, a freshman wideout. The following play featured Michel, a freshman running back, taking a screen pass 33 yards for a touchdown. McKenzie and Michel were teammates at American Heritage High School in Plantation, Florida, and have a chance to make bigger contributions to the Georgia offense as the season continues.With deep-threat wide receivers Malcolm Mitchell and Justin Scott-Wesley still recovering from torn ACLs, Mason has struggled to throw the ball downfield this season. Sophomore Reggie Davis was supposed to fill in for the duo, but so far this season he only claims one 16-yard catch. McKenzie, who stands at 5-foot-8 and weighs 164 pounds, was the recipient of Mason’s longest pass of the season and looks to be a potential deep threat for Georgia.


 


His size is not ideal, but McKenzie has the speed to stretch the field. He has three catches for 47 yards in 2014 and has also been in the mix at punt returner. Georgia head coach Mark Richt said that he feels more comfortable with Davis’ ability to secure the catch on punts, but in his one return this season, McKenzie collected 24 yards against Clemson and was a broken tackle away from a touchdown. In a game where Georgia is projected to win big, McKenzie could have a bigger role through the air and in the return game.His high school teammate could also be in for a productive day against the Trojans. Michel is the third leading rusher on the team with 51 yards, behind Gurley and fellow freshman Nick Chubb. Michel may be the second back against Troy as Chubb underwent surgery on Monday to repair a broken thumb that he sustained in Monday’s practice. In two games, Michel has been featured in the backfield, as a flanker and on special teams. His versatility makes him a threat to receive the ball at multiple spots on the field, and use his quickness to make a big play.The Plantation native has played so well on special teams that he earned captain honors for this week. Had one of Georgia’s former great running backs not redshirted his freshman year, Richt imagines that he would be filling a similar role to Michel’s.""He's probably doing things right now that Knowshon Moreno would have done if I had played him as a freshman,"" Georgia head coach Mark Richt said. ""He's helping the team win in more than one way. I just love his attitude. He made a great tackle on the punt this time and he made a great tackle on the kickoff coverage team in game one but he's flying down that field.""",Connor Smolensky,sports,https://www.redandblack.com/sports/freshmen-michel-mckenzie-making-plays-together/article_dada68d4-3f83-11e4-bdba-001a4bcf6878.html

21-Sep-14,"Admin Admissions: Kelly Kerner discusses differences between the north, south","Kelly Kerner is the vice president of development and alumni relations at the University of Georgia and started his position July 1. He and his family moved from Brunswick, Maine, where he was the senior vice president of development and alumni relations and secretary of Bowdoin College. This week, Kerner sat down to speak with The Red & Black to share his experience at UGA so far and how his transition has been to a new state.The Red & Black: What does a typical day look like for you?Kerner: I have a lot of individual meetings. I’m traveling a little bit locally down to Atlanta and around the state of Georgia to meet alumni, to meet trustees, to do various events that are alumni-related and at some point I’ll begin to get on an airplane more frequently and go out of state and do things for the university in other states that have an alumni representation. So I’m really … straight through on any given day with meetings. I might have a little bit of time here and there to work on email or to do some creative thinking, but not a whole lot right now and that will come as I’ve begun to kind of cycle through the initial stages of all these meetings.


 


R&B: Do you get to interact with students much in your job?K: Never enough. [I] really would love to spend more time with students learning about their experience and understanding it more thoroughly. The reality is because I’m in a fairly administrative-heavy position … it kind of keeps me in meetings a lot and keeps me on the road, which creates less contact with students, but when I’m at events where students are working, I make an effort to meet them and say hello and learn a little bit about them in the process.R&B: How has that transition been coming from Maine to Georgia?K: It is a transition. There’s just no way to say it otherwise. I mean if you think about New England culture versus a southern climate … they’re both very different. People are warm in New England. It just sometimes takes longer to discover that and I’ve always said that the thing about New England is it may take you awhile to discover the warmth and the friendliness, but once you do, it’s there for life and you’re sort of in for life. In my arrival in Georgia, I’ve never felt so warmly welcomed anywhere that I’ve been and people have just reached out and really gone out of their way to make me feel part of the family and my family and make them feel like they’re part of the UGA family.R&B: What’s been the hardest part getting used to the South in terms of differences?K: You know, I think it’s not really a North [and] South thing. I think it’s just the reality of moving to a place where you don’t know anyone and trying to establish new friendships and understand how you’re going to fit as a family into a new community. And we lived in New England for over 20 years. We lived in Maine for over six years. We’d established a lot of very strong, deep friendships and those will persist, but obviously not on a day-to-day basis and it’s a matter of coming here and trying to understand where those friendships [are] going to emanate from and how do you develop those and also understanding just how we, as people who haven’t been steeped in a Southern culture, how we fit into the community here and people have just made that very easy for us.R&B: Have you found any places on campus or just in Athens that you like to spend time at?K: I haven’t gotten to do this very much since I’ve been here just because of how busy I am, but when I do have a few minutes late in an afternoon I love to walk around the North Campus and just be outside and think and look at the buildings and enjoy the students that are around. It’s so beautiful here. I just want to be out in it if I can and so I take advantage of doing that.


 


R&B: If there was one piece of advice you could give to students, what would it be?K: Be open to thinking about what the breath of a UGA education can do for you from a standpoint of finding a job, and a job may not land in the place exactly that you think you will land because you’ve learned a lot of really useful skills here that can be applied to areas — regardless if you’ve left here with a business degree or a journalism degree or a degree in forestry — there are going to be skills that you’ve learned along the way that you can apply to almost any type of work and I’d say be open to the idea that you may find your passion in some place that you weren’t expecting it.",Lauren Pratt @lpratt315,uganews,https://www.redandblack.com/uganews/admin-admissions-kelly-kerner-discusses-differences-between-the-north-south/article_7532237a-3f77-11e4-bbb6-0017a43b2370.html

24-Sep-14,Georgia volleyball opens up SEC play against Alabama on SEC Network,"The first ever volleyball match will broadcast live on the SEC Network Wednesday Sept. 24 at 7 p.m., and the Georgia volleyball team is apart of it.The Bulldogs (8-4) will host the Alabama Crimson Tide (12-2) in a rare Stegeman Coliseum game. Georgia comes into the conference opener off a three-game sweep in the Georgia Tech Invitational in Atlanta this past weekend.Georgia will face a Tide squad with recently named Southeastern Conference Offensive Player of the Week, Krystal Rivers.


 


“Whenever someone has a real power attacker like a Krystal Rivers, our first line of defense is our serve,” said head coach Lizzy Stemke. “We want to make sure we are serving really really tough so they are not insistent, meaning, they are not passing perfect, to have all the options to be able to get her the ball in whatever set they want.”In the all-time series against Alabama, Georgia leads the way with a 23-21 record, 2-3 under coach Stemke. Last season, however, the Tide visited Athens and came away with a 3-1 win over the Bulldogs.The SEC contains three teams ranked in the NCAA Top 25 so far this season. Florida (10), Kentucky (14) and Texas A&M (22) are all teams Georgia will face throughout the season. Stemke said it will be an interesting year in the SEC, as a lot of major contributors from a lot of teams have left, but a strong recruiting pool filled with great athletes have arrived.The SEC will gain not just great incoming athletes, but also more television attention. Georgia is set for 16 total games on the SEC Network this season, including the home opener.“We have so many people that want to watch us, that can’t come to Georgia, that can’t come to Ramsey,” said sophomore Desiree McCray in a recent Georgiadogs.com interview. “Just to know that all they have to do is turn their TV on for a game, and just get excited to see us on the SEC network is a great thing for us.”Stemke added the media attention is huge for the sport of volleyball. She said it’s huge exposure for recruiting and for her players’ families.Five-time SEC Player of the Week during her Georgia career, Maria Taylor, will be announcing the Bulldog’s conference opener for the SEC Network. Taylor played from 2005-2008, and lands fourth in Georgia’s kill record with 1,729 kills.In the last week of practice, Stemke has drilled into her team end of match play. She said her team was very much tested this past weekend, and understands finishing strong will help her team moving forward in the SEC.


 


“It’s always an exciting time of the year once we actually start SEC play,” Stemke said. “We’ve seen results and records against teams from all over the country, but now we get to bring it into conference and see how we match up.”",Sammy O'Brien,sports,https://www.redandblack.com/sports/georgia-volleyball-opens-up-sec-play-against-alabama-on-sec/article_aafccbec-4399-11e4-add6-0017a43b2370.html
24-Sep-14,Georgia volleyball loses SEC opener to Alabama,"Untitled from Sammy obrien on Vimeo.History was made Wednesday night at Stegeman Coliseum as the Georgia versus Alabama volleyball game was the first for the sport to air on the SEC Network.


 


However, history repeated itself when similar to last year, the Bulldogs suffered a 3-1 loss to the Crimson Tide.Georgia (8-5) dropped the conference opener to Alabama (13-2) in four sets (19-25, 28-26, 21-25, 23-25). Though the game stayed close for most of the sets, the Tide’s offense was just too strong.“We had some really great moments of fight,” said Georgia head coach Lizzy Stemke. “There were moments of really good execution. I think we missed some responsibilities at kind of crucial times and those are momentum killers.”The Bulldogs managed to score first, however, Alabama quickly took over the lead. At one point in the first set, the Tide led by as many as seven points. Georgia fought back to bring it within two, but Alabama went on a 6-2 run to end the set at 19-25.The second set was were Georgia shined. The Bulldogs trailed by four points four different times in the set. After trailing 20-16, the Georgia rallied back, and the two squads went head to head till the Bulldogs won 28-26. This set appeared to give Georgia momentum heading into the halftime break, however, Alabama crushed it by winning the final two sets.The third and fourth set were close and at many times point-for-point. However, the Tide pulled away with the help of their recently named Southeastern Conference Offensive Player of the Week, Kyrstal Rivers, who ended her night with 22 kills. In the end, Alabama won the serve pass game, and coach Stemke sees room for improvement in the Bulldogs.“I think our transition game needs to be better. We need to put the ball in the court at the end of the match serving-wise. I think we put some real pressure on Alabama serving, but when we get those opportunities at the end of the game, we need to make sure we are putting it on them.”Though Georgia’s night ended on a low note, the Bulldogs gained a huge crowd at home, and a new viewership on television.


 


“The energy from the crowd was really cool,” said Senior Inutiraha Le’au. “It is a big gym and to see so many seats filled for us, it’s really comforting knowing we have a lot of support behind us.”Le’au picked up from the crowds hype and finished the night with her seventh double-double of the season. She also lead the team in both kills (19) and digs (14). Junior Jasmine Eatmon also performed well, as she posted 11 kills and six blocks.The Bulldogs play again on Wednesday, Oct. 3 in Auburn, Alabama. The game starts at 9 p.m. and will be televised on ESPNU.",Sammy O'Brien,sports,https://www.redandblack.com/sports/georgia-volleyball-loses-sec-opener-to-alabama/article_7253d0f6-4461-11e4-8000-0017a43b2370.html
27-Sep-14,No. 12 Georgia defeats Tennessee 35-32,"Junior defensive lineman Josh Dawson was in the right place at the right time to help Georgia (3-1, 1-1 Southeastern Conference) overcome a sloppy second half to beat Tennessee (2-2, 0-1 SEC) 35-32.Dawson recovered two fumbles in the game, both unforced, including one in the end zone in the fourth quarter, which ended up being the deciding score in the three-point game.“I just try to play when my team needs me,” Dawson said. “When the opportunity comes, I make the most out of it and they came today. Hopefully I made the most out of it.”


 


The Georgia offense ran the ball well well in the first half with 120 yards, including 12 carries for 75 yards from Gurley.Senior quarterback Hutson Mason also had a solid first half despite his first interception of the season, completing 12 of 17 passes for 122 yards and a touchdown to freshman tailback Nick Chubb. Mason also managed rushing touchdown on a read-option call in the red zone.However, the offense didn’t come out after halftime with the same success.Seemingly changing the play calling, offensive coordinator Mike Bobo called five passing plays to start the half. Mason pulled the ball down for a run once of those five plays and went 2-for-4 for 13 yards and his second interception of the game on the other four plays and Georgia would go on to punt in its next four drives.“Sometimes you’ve just got to give credit to the defense,” Mason said. “Some plays you’re not going to win, some plays they are but the most important thing is we just kept fighting and, kind of like that Clemson game, we were stalling out and stalling out and with the defense playing pretty good, we figured eventually we’d spit one of make a play.”Compounding Mason’s struggles was the fact that Gurley was rarely used in the quarter, including a nearly 11 minute stretch in which Gurley did not have a carry.“I feel like every team … it’s who’s going to be the strongest in the fourth quarter,” Gurley said. “That’s what we trained for this summer and that’s the way we practice.”Instead, the defense played a stellar, limiting the Volunteers to just 62 total yards and Dawson’s first recovered fumble.


 


“The defense had a lot of series there, especially in the third quarter, when they didn’t have a lot of grass behind them,” Georgia head coach Mark Richt said. “I thought the defense did a phenomenal job after both turnovers, not giving up any points.”Things shifted in the fourth, however, when Gurley picked back up where he left off, rushing for 129 yards and a 51-yard touchdown to help separate the Georgia in what had been a 21-17 game for the entire third quarter. Gurley finished with 208 yards rushing, a career high and his first 200 yard rushing game.“I was just running,” Gurley said. “I didn’t even know I was even close. I’m happy, my line did a great job. I couldn’t have did it without those guys.”Tennessee would exploit the Georgia secondary for two passing touchdowns in the quarter, but Dawson’s fumble recovery for a touchdown ultimately gave Georgia the win.",Cody Pace,sports,https://www.redandblack.com/sports/no-georgia-defeats-tennessee/article_c0d9be8e-467d-11e4-88e4-0017a43b2370.html
27-Sep-14,Hutson Mason disappointed by his two-interception performance Saturday,"Georgia senior quarterback Hutson Mason wasn’t happy about his performance in Saturday’s win over Tennessee.“It’s frustrating,” Mason said. “It’s just, I don’t know, I don’t have an answer for it. We bust our butts Monday through Friday but like I said, I’m the quarterback and I’m the leader of this offense and it starts with me. We’ll continue to try and find a way.”Mason talked after the game like he was the losing quarterback after he didn’t live up to his own expectations. He went 16-for-25 on the evening for 147 yards, but threw two interceptions and struggled mightily in the second half, which resulted in a difficult third quarter for the offense.


 


What really frustrated Mason, though, was how the offense performed well in the second quarter and then came out and struggled to get anything going in the third, including his second interception of the day on the second play of the half.“We threw the ball pretty well in the second quarter and coming out in the first quarter we get a good completion and then a pick, which killed us and from there on out it seemed like one little thing led to another and we couldn’t execute at all in the pass game,” Mason said. “It’s very frustrating and it starts with me … It just flat out starts with me getting better in the passing game.”But the blame was plenty to go around.For starters, Mason was under pressure frequently despite Tennessee’s defensive gameplan that was designed to corral the run.“We gave up three sacks and I think that’s maybe our first sacks of the season,” senior center David Andrews said. “That’s frustrating to me personally. We’ve got to do some better things there and make him feel comfortable.”But Mason wasn’t under duress on every missed opportunity.There were passes that were dropped that should have been caught and general miscommunication between Mason and the receivers.“There’s still some miscommunication between guys and, you know, we’ve got some freshmen guys out there,” Mason said. “The touchdown pass that I threw to Chubb really wasn’t the right route. I see him running the other route and I had enough protection where I could just sit in there and at least hit him on it.”


 


Even the experienced receivers struggled.Mason’s second interception, the one that led off the second half, was a one-on-one pass aimed at senior Chris Conley. After the fact, Conley admitted that it was his mistake, and not Mason’s, that resulted in the interception.“It comes down to the way that I run that route,” Conley said. “He has an area that he’s throwing the ball to and if I don’t run the route, which I did right there, I allowed the corner to get in my area where I was supposed to be.”But at the end of the day, it doesn’t matter for the offense if the fault belonged to Mason or the offensive line or the receivers or anyone else—the problems will have to be fixed for Georgia to contend in the long run.“The reality is, we didn’t get separation out there, too,” Georgia head coach Mark Richt said. “We need to get some guys that give you something a little more exciting to throw to than just a back-shoulder throw sometimes on the deep balls … I don’t know what the words to use but we’re definitely not clicking throwing the ball like we like around here.”",Cody Pace,sports,https://www.redandblack.com/sports/hutson-mason-disappointed-by-his-two-interception-performance-saturday/article_5c5bfc6a-46aa-11e4-91d1-001a4bcf6878.html

According to the CDC, the individual left Liberia on Friday, Sept. 19, and arrived in the U.S. on Saturday, Sept. 20. It was reported the patient had no symptoms until Sept. 24. Then, on Sept. 26, they sought care and two days later was admitted to Texas Health Presbyterian in Dallas.Despite occurring in Texas, one University official believes the threat of Ebola might not be too far off.“Atlanta is a big airport, a similar thing could happen in Atlanta,” said Glen Nowak, director of the Center for Health and Risk Communication at UGA.On Thursday, Sept. 25, UGA hosted a community forum in conjunction with Athens Regional Hospital to answer questions students, faculty and residents had concerning Ebola.“Here at the University of Georgia, we have lots of information on Ebola-related illness in our Health Center.

30-Sep-14,Georgia volleyball heads to Auburn for first SEC road test,"After a 3-1 loss to Alabama in its first Southeastern Conference game, the Georgia volleyball team looks to rebound against the Auburn Tigers on Wednesday.Facing their first SEC road test, the 8-5 Bulldogs will look to implement tough blocking and hitting against the 8-7 Tigers.Although the team focuses on blocking, serving and passing as the central focus of their strategy, head coach Lizzy Stemke felt the Bulldogs strayed from those basics in their loss to the Crimson Tide.


 


“The things we have been working on are the things we need to continue to work on,” Stemke said. “It’s not going to change in a night or even a week, but we hope to see longer consistency in those changes.“Through the combined efforts of middle blockers Desiree McCray and Jasmine Eatmon and outside hitter Lauren Teknipp, Georgia leads the conference in blocks per set with 2.89. The Bulldogs’ scrappy defensive play is coupled with a highly efficient offense, hitting at a .275 percent efficiency.However, Georgia faces a tough defensive opponent in Auburn libero Alyssa Ivey who is averaging 4. 31 digs per set.The consistency of senior outside hitter Tirah Le’au has played a large role in the Bulldogs’ success so far this season and will likely increase as conference battles ensue. Le’au achieved her seventh double-double against Alabama with 19 kills and 14 digs, leading the team in both categories.Georgia leads the overall series with Auburn 13-6, but lost their last battle with the Tigers 3-1 in 2012.

However, the Bulldogs broke down in the fourth set, losing 11-25.


 


Georgia got off to a strong start, tying the Tigers multiple times and even establishing a 15-13 lead. But nine straight points by the Tigers would lift them to match point and eventually the 25-18 victory.After falling 25-16 in the second set, the Bulldogs fought back from a 16-9 deficit with the help of blocking by middle blocker Desiree McCray and kills by outside hitter Lauren Teknipp to take the third set 25-23.In the fourth set, the Bulldogs got behind early at 14-4 and could not recover, falling 25-11 in the fourth and final set.It was an offensively slow night for the Bulldogs as Teknipp led the team with ten kills but hit at just .179 percent. Outside hitter Tirah Le’au, who has accrued seven double-doubles this season, was held to eight kills hitting at .027 percent.Defensively, Teknipp and McCray both posted one solo block and three assisted blocks.

5-Oct-14,Online threats call for action by university faculty,"In the wake of the Yik Yak horror which hit the SLC, comes equally frightening threats to the world of the SEC, mainly targeting sororities. The University of Alabama has found itself handling a threat much like our own, but one that cannot be passed off as a prank made in exceptionally poor taste.An alarming comment showed up on a YouTube video, made by a man referring to himself as Authur Pendragon. It targeted sororities and made death threats against them, all in the name of retribution for the mistreatment of minorities. Tutwiler, an all-girls dorm, was locked down in response. Police went on high alert and parked around the dorm as well as near the sorority houses. The all clear was given Sunday night. Police have made an arrest against one man, Dakota Timm, who made alarming threats that had no relationship to the original Pendragon comments, other than to compound on the fear and confusion facing the students.To me, it is clear that a pattern has been created. Mr. Arias, the Yik-Yak terrorist. has now created a trend that is lighting up the south. It seems the amount of attention and response that UGA received due to the attacks has incited other thrill seekers to try their hands at mass panic. It is shocking that there are people who believe that these threats constitute a good prank, or even that these people harbor such animosity that they want to watch people squirm.


 


To most people, making a bomb threat for thrills would not even occur to them, so why is it becoming a trend? Perhaps it is because of the isolation prevalent on college campuses. College is a very social experience, and for many that fact is charming and exciting, but to those who have difficulty making friends it can make a campus seem large and lonely. It is easy to turn the blame on others when one feels rejected by their peers. Maybe that is why this Pendragon decided to threaten a sorority, an extremely exclusive group of mostly privileged girls.It infuriates me that someone can find it in themselves to think that any sins of one group then excuses their own actions against them. This disturbing trend of winding up the police and students to incite a panic must be stopped. This is why it is important that people like Arias be prosecuted despite their claims of it just being a prank. Yik Yak has hosted a number of these threats in high schools and colleges around the country and it is more important than ever that those who make these threats understand the scope of their actions.There is no joking and this trend cannot be allowed to continue. It is essential that in this downward spiral we are in of violence and anger be stopped, whether it is by a higher sense of community among college students or if it will be a show of force by police and faculty. People have to be held responsible for their actions.— Shelby Masters is a sophomore from Johns Creek majoring in pre-journalism",Shelby Masters @Masters_Shelbz,views,https://www.redandblack.com/views/online-threats-call-for-action-by-university-faculty/article_88aa3b98-48e3-11e4-929f-0017a43b2370.html
5-Oct-14,Georgia volleyball downs Missouri in strong defensive performance,"After a disappointing start, the Georgia volleyball team seemed to come into their own in a Southeastern conference win against the Missouri Tigers.The Tigers, now 11-7, played aggressive defense from the opening serve, tallying seven blocks before even reaching match point in their 25-17 win in the first set.But after shaking off their overall slow performance in the first set, the Bulldogs rallied and were able to consistently capitalize on their opponent’s errors and move to 9-6 on the season and 1-2 in conference play.


 


“It shows that we’re playing together as one,” said middle blocker Desiree McCray, who finished with four blocks and eight kills. “And we’re not spread apart. It’s really good to get a good win like that against a good team.”The Bulldogs’ offensive efforts were led by right side hitter Megan Spencer, who hit in the .700s for most of the night but finished with 14 kills hitting at a .579 efficiency.She credited Georgia’s win to the cohesiveness of the team on offense and the team feeling particularly motivated after two SEC losses.“We really needed this,” Spencer said. “We were coming out ready for our first SEC win, and I think that our offense is insane. Our setters put up great balls and passers obviously start that.”In the second set, the Bulldogs welcomed a 6-2 lead mostly due to kills by middle blocker McCray. Although service errors by the Bulldogs and tough blocking by the Tigers kept Missouri in the game, the Bulldogs showed poise and maintained a close lead. Kills by senior outside hitters Lauren Teknipp and Tirah Le’au brought the score to 19-13 and forced a Missouri timeout, but Georgia continued in its offensive rhythm to take the set 25-18.The Bulldogs looked comfortable while jumping out to an 8-3 lead in the third set and continued to offensively control the court. Missouri’s attack and service errors did not better their chances, and they added just four blocks on the night after their initial surge of seven in the first set. Georgia took advantage of errors by the Tigers as Le’au responded with back-to-back kills. An easy kill by outside hitter Amanda Dachs sealed the 25-17 win.After a close 7-7 start in the fourth set, eight attack errors by the Tigers crippled their hopes for a comeback. The match fittingly ended on a kill by Spencer, who had match and career-high numbers against Missouri, to finish 25-20.The Bulldogs employed a double-substitute system with freshman setter Kendall Kazor and Spencer rotating in, which coach Stemke credits in helping the team find a more consistent rhythm.


 


Georgia also had many players assisting on the back line, as libero Gaby Smiley finished with ten digs and Le’au had 11, with setter Kaylee Kehoe adding 12 digs.“Our defensive effort started with Gaby I think she kept us into rallies and made sure that the ball was staying off our floor,” Stemke said. “But then I also give a lot of credit to our double sub. Kendall and Megan came in and that substitution opened up a lot of holes for a lot of our players.”",Sarah Spencer,sports,https://www.redandblack.com/sports/georgia-volleyball-downs-missouri-in-strong-defensive-performance/article_f37d07a4-4cf1-11e4-95df-001a4bcf6878.html
10-Oct-14,Going Green: UGA improving energy output on campus,"The University of Georgia has set in motion a plan to replace its old coal-fired boiler with a more efficient electricity-powered unit by November 2015, the latest in a series of moves toward improving energy efficiency on campus.Former Georgia Gov. Sonny Perdue challenged all state government agencies and departments in 2008 to reduce their energy consumption by 15 percent by 2020. Using 2007 as a baseline, associate vice president for Facilities Management Ralph Johnson said UGA will have already surpassed this goal by the end of the 2014 fiscal year.Given this progress, UGA has decided to up the ante with an internal goal to reduce its energy consumption by 25 percent by 2020, said David Spradley, director of Energy Services in the Facilities Management Division.


 


“It’s going to be hard work, but we think we can get there,” he said.The most recent step toward that end was replacing the coal boiler with an electrode one.UGA uses four boilers for steam and heat on campus, three that run on natural gas and one on coal. The electrode boiler, which is powered by electricity from Georgia Power, will replace the approximately 50-year-old coal boiler, Johnson said.Because natural gas is the cheapest fuel, those boilers function as the primary units for the University. But for approximately 20 days every winter, the natural gas companies interrupt this service due to higher demand elsewhere and so there’s a need for a backup boiler, Johnson said. A fourth boiler also provides insurance in case one of the others breaks, Spradley said.“In the dead of winter, it gets so cold occasionally we have to run three boilers just to meet demand from campus, so we need to have a fourth boiler, as you can imagine, because Murphy’s Law is something’s going to break,” he said.As a result, UGA has had to run the coal boiler constantly for four months every winter, as starting it up takes several days, Johnson said.“It was like starting a fire in your fireplace kind of thing — you have to stoke it and get it built up in order for it to be steady,” he said.The electrode boiler, which will cost about $4.5 million to install, will be able to start up in 20 minutes, Spradley said. As a result, money will be saved from not having to run the coal boiler steadily throughout the winter as well as not having to pay to ship and dump the coal ash, which will equate to about $500,000 per year, Johnson said.


 


Additionally, running the electrode boiler will create no new emissions, improving air quality throughout Athens, Spradley said. About 300 tons of sulfur dioxide and sub-particulate matter will no longer be put into the atmosphere by the coal boiler, Spradley said.“Directly on this campus, it’s 100 percent environmentally friendly,” he said.Tyler Faby, a senior finance major from Milton and member of UGA Beyond Coal, said replacing the coal boiler is the biggest step he’s seen toward increasing sustainability on campus.“There’s still a ton of room for improvement, but I think we’re finally headed in the right direction at the right speed,” he said.And the electrode boiler is just the beginning of UGA’s sustainability projects this semester.Another project UGA has in the works to reduce energy consumption is a series of electrical and mechanical system upgrades to eight buildings on East Campus.The project, funded through the Georgia Environmental Finance Authority’s Guaranteed Energy Savings Performance Contracting program, will equate to about a 20-percent energy reduction on average over the eight buildings by the time it’s completed around May 2016, Spradley said.“It reduces our energy consumption, it helps us avoid paying higher utility bills, it makes us more sustainable — it helps create a more sustainable campus, which is what we’re all aiming toward,” he said.


TNCMS.AdManager.render({region: 'fixed-big-ad-bottom-asset', slot: 1, fold: ""below""});


The project is serving as a pilot along with one at the Georgia Institute of Technology and, if they succeed, the program could be expanded in later years, Spradley said.“That was a significant infrastructure project that will move the needle,” said Kevin Kirsche, director of the Office of Sustainability. “There’s significant opportunities on a campus-wide infrastructure scale to affect real energy conservation on campus.”In addition, UGA has plans to expand the service of District Energy Plant 1, which already provides chilled water for air conditioning to the Richard B. Russell Library, the Zell B. Miller Learning Center, the Tate Student Center, the Instructional Plaza and Bolton Dining Commons, Johnson said.“There’s more to the story than just the electrode boiler and the Guaranteed Energy program — we’re continually doing projects for energy savings throughout the campus,” Johnson said.UGA is now installing another chiller, which will add the capacity needed to take on the load for several residence halls and Correll Hall, to be located in the new Terry College Learning Community, Johnson said. Running a facility like this is more efficient usage of electricity as it allows one central chiller to run at a higher load than multiple individual building chillers running well below their capacities, Spradley said.EITS is also working on ways to reduce its energy consumption by monitoring room temperatures and working on improving the efficiency of air conditioning for the Internet servers, said Jeff Teasley, director of operations and infrastructure at the Boyd Data Center.“A lot of it’s simple stuff, but it’s a change in the whole conservation-minded mentality — you just think about that more now,” he said. “It’s all about saving the University dollars.”Teasley said through these changes and others, Boyd Data Center has cut about $134,000 per year in energy consumption.

“We’re at one of the top universities in the country and each one of us who graduates is going to be doing something hopefully big career-wise, and sustainability and clean tech and clean energy policy; these are all big things that UGA grads can lead in [on],” Faby said.",Gabe Cavallaro @gabe_cavallaro,uganews,https://www.redandblack.com/uganews/going-green-uga-improving-energy-output-on-campus/article_33d5feec-4e7c-11e4-b2b1-0017a43b2370.html
10-Oct-14,"Georgia volleyball travels to Florida, Arkansas this weekend","Georgia volleyball travels to Gainesville, Florida on Friday, and Fayetteville, Arkansas on Sunday to face a couple of tough in conference opponents this weekend.The Georgia volleyball team (9-6, 1-2 Southeastern Conference) plays No. 9 University of Florida (10-3, 4-0 SEC) and Arkansas (9-8, 3-1 SEC) and will try and improve its SEC record.“Any conference match is a good win,” head coach Lizzy Stemke said . “I think some things clicked. That’s always good when that happens. It’s something for us to build on.”


 


The Bulldogs split last weekends series taking a 3-1 win over Missouri at home on Sunday, and a 3-1 at Auburn on Wednesday Oct. 1. In the win over the Tigers, redshirt sophomore Megan Spencer led the team with 14 kills and a .579 efficiency rating.Coach Stemke and Spencer practiced different formations leading up to the weekend, which could have led to each others success.“We’ve been working a lot our 6-2,” Spencer said. “We’ve been working on so many defenses as a team. So when one thing wasn’t working, like the first set, we just had to switch it up.”Stemke said her team has been practicing both a 6-2 system as well as 5-1 to make sure they are ready for a number of situations. She said the other night, after Georgia fell a set to Missouri, they switched to 6-2 so another attacker could help the offense. It was a tactical decision both offensively and defensively.Looking forward to this weekend, Stemke says both teams are very physical. Florida is one of just three ranked SEC teams, while Arkansas only has one loss in the conference.Georgia trails the Florida series 9-57, including the last match up - a 3-0 for the Gators in Gainesville last season. The last time the Bulldogs won a series was back in 2008 in Athens.“I’m always looking forward to like, we’re the underdog, we are not expected to win, we have nothing to lose,” Spencer said confidently. “We are going to come out with our biggest game and we expect to win. We aren’t expecting to roll over.”As for Arkansas, the Bulldogs trail that all-time series 9-18, including a 3-1 loss at Arkansas last season.

13-Oct-14,"In the Headlines: Spread of Ebola worries national, international officials","The Red & Black has been a leader of University of Georgia news since its founding in 1893, but a lot goes on in the world beyond the Arch. From Spain to Washington, here is a brief roundup of what international stories made headlines this week.1. SpainPlaying the blame game: Spanish health workers are unsatisfied with the government's handle on the spread of the Ebola virus. One nurse is suffering from the infectious virus after treating two patients that were also infected with Ebola. The two patients are dead and the health of the nurse is worsening.


 


2. DallasA first for America: Thomas Eric Duncan will be known as the first Ebola case in the United States. Duncan died Wednesday after receiving treatment from Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital. A Dallas county deputy also began showing symptoms of Ebola exposure that same day. Michael Monnig was transported from Frisco to Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital in Dallas. His test results, however, were negative. A second case was also reported in Dallas on Sunday. The patient has been identified as a female nurse, who treated Duncan.3. AirportsMore screenings: Health screenings are the new line of defense to prevent the spread of Ebola. New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport began screenings on Saturday. Four other airports, including Atlanta's Hartsfield-Jackson Airport, will begin additional screenings next week. Officials from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said about 150 travelers a day will receive these screenings.4. Same-sex marriageThe Supremes have spoken: The Supreme Court lifted same-sex marriage bans in seven states last week. The Court refused to hear appeals from the reversal of the bans in Indiana, Wisconsin, Oklahoma, Utah and Virginia on Monday. Nevada followed the next day. The Court also struck down the ban in Idaho on Friday after Justice Anthony M. Kennedy issued a temporary stay a few days prior. This raises the number of states that legally recognize same-sex marriages to 26.5. Nobel Peace PrizeYoungest winner in history: Malala Yousafzai won the Nobel Peace Prize on Friday. Yousafzai, 17, was recognized for her advocacy work for young girls' rights to education. After publicly denouncing the Taliban's action to close all schools, Yousafzai became a target of the terrorist group and was shot in the back of the head while walking home from school. She has made appearances on Jon Stewart's The Daily Show and was Time magazine's 2012 runner-up for Person of the Year.

19-Oct-14,Column: Nick Chubb filling in perfectly for Gurley,"If you thought you were busy this weekend, step into the shoes of Georgia running back Nick Chubb.Chubb set another career high in rushing on Saturday, breaking the 200-yard mark against Arkansas and adding two more touchdowns – his second and third since starting during Toddy Gurley’s suspension.Georgia has proven it puts a lot of trust in Chubb’s skills as a ball carrier. Chubb tallied 30 carries against Arkansas after a heaping 38 rushing attempts in Columbia, Missouri last week. Chubb broke 10 carries in just one other game during his freshman season: his previous high was 11 against Tennessee.


 


Chubb has been a huge player for Georgia after its running back wrecking crew lost junior Keith Marshall and another freshman phenomenon Sony Michel. Chubb’s last two games have each garnered more touches than Gurley ever had in a single game. Chubb is a driving force in the Georgia backfield, an he is doing it all with minimal help.Georgia has never relied on Todd Gurley like it’s relied on Chubb the past two weeks. Gurley missed a handful of games last seasons with an injury, but he still only averaged 16 carries when he returned from that stretch. Gurley was splitting carries with running backs Brendan Douglas and J.J. Green, who made the switch back to running back last week but never saw the field.Marshall’s return is still some weeks off and it is yet to be seen whether Michel can return and produce at the same pace as when he left. Until Gurley returns, Georgia head coach Mark Richt is sitting in a horse draw carriage pulled by Nick Chubb.This has to be a point of concern for the Bulldogs. With the running back core as beat up as it is, overworking a strong freshman back is like walking a tight rope with lots of slack. No doubt, Georgia is excited about Chubb. This is a guy who could help the Bulldogs a lot down the road and, if he stays healthy, could be at Gurley status in a couple of seasons. Now Richt and offensive coordinator Mike Bobo need to balance Chubb’s stellar play without overusing their thoroughbred freshman.Chubb’s limited touches at the beginning of the season may have saved him for Georgia’s stretch without Gurley. Eventually, Georgia will regain some strength at this position, and Gurley’s turn will undoubtedly turn the Bulldog offense back into the wrecking ball it was before Vanderbilt. In case Gurley madness has kept you watching Georgia games in a psychotropic hallucination of signed three-jerseys and disappearing Heisman trophies, Georgia’s offense is still good – oddly, even better – without Gurley.Trust in Todd all you want, but Georgia seems content to let the backs take their time, while its young stallion pulls the wagon for a few weeks.",Taylor Denman,sports,https://www.redandblack.com/sports/column-nick-chubb-filling-in-perfectly-for-gurley/article_11a11134-57b6-11e4-ac6b-001a4bcf6878.html
20-Oct-14,Georgia 911 Medical Amnesty Law begins to take effect on campus,"As of April 24, 2014, the Georgia 911 Medical Amnesty Law provides immunities from arrests, charges and prosecution for people calling 911 and seeking medical attention after drug overdoses.The law not only assures amnesty related from drug charges but also from alcohol use and possession charges when someone calls 911 for help. It has also expanded access to the opioid antidote known as Naloxone, or Narcan, which reverses the effects of drug overdoses.“The point to me of the law is that you keep people alive long enough to get [them] into long-term recovery, so that they can have a life,” said Robin Elliott, member of the Georgia Overdose Prevention group which lobbied to pass the law.


 


Elliott lost her son, Zack, to a heroin overdose in May 2011.In an April 2014 article, The Red & Black addressed the elements of the law more specifically.In effect for six months, the law has slowly started to gain publicity and will hopefully encourage students to call for help in overdose situations, said Laurie Fugitt, a Georgia Overdose Prevention Group member.“It just [takes] getting the word out. You know if one kid reads this, goes out to a party, sees someone in trouble and then takes the time to call 911 then how awesome would that be,” said Fugitt, a University of Georgia graduate.At UGA, Chief of Police Jimmy Williamson said that one case has occurred in which a student may have been swayed to call the police because of the law. However, overall the situation has not changed in regards to students being more willing to call.“We had one case pop-up so far. I don’t know if this [law] would have caused the guy to call or not, we will assume it’s a success, but he said ‘listen, I’ve taken some stuff and I think I need some help,’” said Williamson. “We got an ambulance over there and police over there, got him where he needed to go, and he wasn’t charged but I can’t tell you that now a bunch of people are calling us.”Although it is unclear whether 911 calls have increased because of the law, UGA police have been making significant changes in regards to Naloxone access.The 911 Medial Amnesty Law allows for anyone to get a prescription from a doctor for any person at risk of an overdose. The law also allows police to carry the antidote, as they are typically the first responders.


 


“For 40 years, the drug has been used in emergency departments. Where it is really needed is out in the field. When somebody overdoses, every minute that passes is vitally important,” said Fugitt. “It is a lot more valuable if the friends out in the field or the person who overdoses have [Naloxone] or if the officers who show up have it or the ambulance crew.”After training and paperwork, UGA police officers will begin to carry Naloxone so that they are able to reverse drug overdoses on scene and save more students who have overdosed.“Since there is no real risk to administer it incorrectly, then we are willing to take on that role. But, we are just not there completely. It’s about 50 percent done,” said Williamson.Students will also be able to carry Naloxone themselves for their own need or the need of friends if an overdose situation occurs.“We really hope that at some point pharmacies in Athens will be carrying it,” said Fugitt. “I’m hoping that before too long somebody can just go to the University Health Center and get a prescription for it and go get it filled.”Because of the law, overdose prevention organization such as the Georgia Overdose Prevention group and Atlanta Harm Reduction Coalition will be able to supply Naloxone rescue kits as well.The law provides amnesty in overdose situation and the increased access to Naloxone so that hopefully student lives will be saved, Fugitt said.“People need to know it’s okay. Don’t run, call 911 and save your friend’s life,” said Elliott. “It’s worth it.”

EbolaBig Apple takes on virus: A doctor in New York tested positive for the Ebola virus on Thursday. After returning from his work in Guinea last week, Craig Spencer, 33, came back to the United States without showing any symptoms of Ebola until Thursday. In efforts to control the spread of the virus, New York Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo and Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey enacted a mandatory quarantine on Friday for travelers arriving at two area airports who have had direct contact with those infected with Ebola.


 


2. Indiana serial killer suspectSeven deaths, few answers: A former Marine and registered sex offender is claiming he killed seven women in Indiana. Police arrested Darren Vann, 43, on Saturday and charged him with strangling 19-year-old Afrikka Hardy to death. Then police charged Vann on Wednesday in the death of Anith Jones, 35. Five more bodies were found Sunday. Two of the women were Gary, Indiana residents — Teaira Batey, 28, and Kristine Williams, 36. Police have not determined the identities of the other three women, including two whose bodies were found on the same block where Jones' body was found Saturday. Vann refused to acknowledge his name during his hearing on Wednesday. The judge has scheduled another initial hearing for this week.3.

1-Nov-14,Florida trounces Georgia in Jacksonville,"Jacksonville, Fla. – No. 11 Georgia had everything going in its favor to start Saturday’s game against Florida — until the wheels fell off on both sides of the ball.Georgia (6-2, 4-2 Southeastern Conference) started with an up-tempo pace and effortlessly scored on a Nick Chubb 39 yard touchdown on its second drive of the game. But the Georgia offense didn’t score again in the first half and managed just two more scores in the 38-20 loss to Florida (4-3, 3-3 SEC).“I felt like that we started out pretty good,” Georgia head coach Mark Richt said. “Got a nice touchdown drive. Moved the ball decently well in the first quarter but then after that didn’t get a whole lot going in the first half.”


 


No player characterized the offensive woes more than Chubb. In the first quarter alone he had 101 yard and that touchdown, along with an 18 yard reception. In the second quarter, he had just three carries for seven yards.The story was much the same for the Georgia defense as well.In their first three offensive drives, the Gators punted twice and turned the ball over on a fumble as the defense prevented Florida from crossing the 50 yard line. After those three drives, Florida had touchdowns on three of its next six drives and also had a field goal.“Sometime in the second quarter on, whether they were gaining yards or not in the first quarter, they started imposing their will on us and changed the way we were thinking a little bit,” Georgia defensive coordinator Jeremy Pruitt said.The big problem for the defense was the Gators running back tandem of Matt Jones and Kelvin Taylor. Despite the fact that Florida only attempted six passes on the evening and just one in the second half, Taylor and Jones combined for 389 rushing yards and four touchdowns and provided 86.25 percent of Florida’s total offensive production. Florida's combined 418 rushing yards is the second most in Georgia history.The game was a career high for Taylor, who finished with 197 yards, as well as for Jones, who had 192.“In the locker room, Kelvin Taylor and I said thank you to the offensive linemen because they blocked very well tonight and kept going all the way through four quarters,” Jones said. “We definitely needed that from these boys.”Georgia managed to show a little bit of life in the fourth quarter, but it ended up too little too late as Michael Bennett couldn’t hold on to a touchdown that would have brought Georgia within 12 points with 5 minutes remaining in the game, essentially sealing the Bulldogs' fate.


 


The loss drops Georgia’s all-time lead in the series to 49-38-2 and 43-38-1 since the game has been played in Jacksonville.",Cody Pace,sports,https://www.redandblack.com/sports/florida-trounces-georgia-in-jacksonville/article_a6da0f74-6217-11e4-a5b1-001a4bcf6878.html
2-Nov-14,Column: More than a loss to Florida,"If the loss to Florida stings a little more than it usually does, it is because this result is more than just a regular loss to Florida.Georgia first lost to Florida in 1928. Georgia went through a stretch from 1990 to 2010 where the Bulldogs lost to Florida 18 times. Losing to Florida is nothing new for Georgia. Sometimes you beat a rival, sometimes your rival beats you.The reason Saturday’s 38-20 whooping felt worse than a normal Florida defeat was because it likely ended any chance of Georgia playing in the first College Football Playoff.


 


Going into yesterday, Georgia controlled its own path to the Southeastern Conference Championship, something head coach Mark Richt has spoken at length about. If Georgia could beat Florida, Kentucky, Auburn, Charleston Southern and Georgia Tech, fans believed that if their Bulldogs defeated the SEC West champion that Georgia would be in the playoff.But after the surrendering 418 yards rushing and 38 points to a Florida offense that has represented a dumpster fire at times this year, all those dreams and hopes of a playoff appearance are now all but gone. With losses to Florida and South Carolina, teams with a combined record of 8-8, Georgia would need absolute and utter anarchy to happen across the entire college football landscape to give Georgia a sliver of hope.Fans had hoped that Georgia could beat Florida and Kentucky without star tailback Todd Gurley, who is suspended for accepting over $3000 in a two year period for selling his autograph, and then with Gurley back defeat Auburn at home on Nov. 15. Given Georgia’s play in its first two games without Gurley, a 34-0 win over Missouri and 45-32 win over Arkansas, this was not an outlandish thought.Now just to get to Atlanta, the Bulldogs need Missouri to lose at least once while beating both Auburn and Kentucky. In one Saturday in Jacksonville, Florida, the season cruelly went from one that could be special to just another season where Richt and the Bulldogs come up short.This cruelty is what makes college football so great and so awful at the same time. Each game essentially becomes a playoff game as one loss dooms a season.The cruelness of college football was at its peak yesterday in Oxford, Mississippi. With less than two minutes to play and Ole Miss trailing Auburn 35-31, Laquon Treadwell, Ole Miss’ best player, took a short pass 23 yards and was rapidly approaching the end zone.But an Auburn player pulled Treadwell down from behind at the 1-yard line. On the tackle, Treadwell’s leg bent backwards and ultimately broke, as he was later diagnosed with a broken fibula. To make matters worse, inches before he reached the endzone, Treadwell fumbled the ball as his leg snapped, and Auburn recovered the ball in the endzone. Auburn won the game 35-31.A season that saw the Rebels start 7-0, now has gone to waste as the Rebels have lost their last two games by a combined seven points. A team that some were touting as a national champion contender, like Georgia, sits in playoff ruin.


 


Georgia very well could win the SEC East and the SEC. It could also lose to Kentucky, Auburn and even Georgia Tech. While the two results are at the extreme ends of the spectrum, they both pale in what could have been for Georgia this season.And this disappointment, no matter how Georgia finishes, is what makes college football the cruelest of sports.",Connor Riley,sports,https://www.redandblack.com/sports/column-more-than-a-loss-to-florida/article_5063fa78-62b3-11e4-a99c-0017a43b2370.html
3-Nov-14,Bulldogs say they weren't ready to play against Florida,"For a lot of Georgia fans, the worst thing about last Saturday’s 38-20 loss to Florida wasn’t the porous defense or the conservative offense. It was the fact that it was recorded on film, available for replay after agonizing replay as a simple reminder that the game did actually happen.Of all cohorts of the Georgia faithful, one would expect the Georgia team itself to be the most reluctant to review the tape, not wanting to relive control-losing trouncing Florida put on the Bulldogs.Damian Swann does not see it that way.


 


“It wasn’t hard,” the senior cornerback said of rewatching the film. “It wasn’t hard.”In the words of Swann and many of his defensive teammates, the replays didn’t sting because the loss is in the past. The players are aware of this and are ready to move on.“Regroup and move forward,” Swann said of what the team must do to succeed. “That’s pretty much all we can do. We can’t really hang our head too much over that. Saturday’s gone. We need to move on to Kentucky.”As important as moving on may be, the repetitive, twinging reminders of the game will never exactly dissipate from the narrative of Georgia’s 2014 season or the narrative of Georgia’s senior class as a whole. Though neither Swann nor senior teammates Mike Thornton and Ramik Wilson said that they believed this loss was the hardest to stomach in their careers, Swann said it was far from the first time a Georgia team failed to execute defensively in a key matchup.Wilson said he knows why.“They came ready to play,” Wilson said. “We didn’t. Film don’t lie. The stats don’t lie. They came to play and they did a good job. And we didn’t.”The resounding theme the three seniors continued to mention was the idea that the Georgia defense failed to execute versus Florida. Thornton identified that as the factor which disappointed him the most when the team reviewed Saturday’s film.Echoing Thornton’s sentiments, Swann took the sentiment one further, saying that Georgia’s lack of execution sat paramount above Florida’s sustained execution.


 


“We just didn’t do what we were supposed to do,” Swann said. “It really wasn’t about them. Give them credit for winning the game but it really wasn’t about them. It was about us. We know that. We’ve got to get it corrected.”As for why Georgia was unable to execute, Swann said he was unable to provide an answer. That being said, Wilson was able to postulate a theory, one independent of the normal excuses of playing on the road or without tailback Todd Gurley.“We weren’t ready to play,” Wilson said. “We underestimated our opponents. We weren’t ready to play. We just didn’t play with the fire we normally play with.”Just as Wilson acknowledged that he wanted to remember the game without fabricating any excuses, so too did Swann.“We can’t really look for excuses, we’re not going to try to find any excuses, we’re just going to try to control the things we can control and fix the things we can fix and just go play football,” Swann said.",Nick Suss,sports,https://www.redandblack.com/sports/bulldogs-say-they-weren-t-ready-to-play-against-florida/article_f4fbd26a-63bf-11e4-8687-001a4bcf6878.html
3-Nov-14,Morgan still unsure about 39-yard miss against Florida,"Marshall Morgan wants to make sure that no field goal kicker has to go through the agony of a judgment call from a referee determining whether a field goal is good or not, as was the case for his 39-yard miss in the first quarter of Saturday’s loss.“In the future after the whole college football thing and hopefully my dreams of a career after that, I’m going to come up with some kind of laser, something that shoots straight up that makes it a little easier to judge,” Morgan joked. “I do have a few buddies that are engineers that have invented some pretty good stuff. ... I’m business man, so finance, I could maybe help sell it.”Besides thinking about lasers, Morgan has done a lot of reviewing of the controversial call and has yet to change his opinion about the kick being good.


 


“I thought it was good from where we were but the ref called it no good so he had a better view on it so I guess it was no good,” Morgan said.Morgan knew from the start of warmups that the Everbank Stadium winds were going to cause him some trouble. Before the game, Jacksonville was put under a wind advisory for a potential of winds up to 40 miles per hour and the kickoff gusts were estimated around 20 miles per hour.“It’s kind of weird when it’s that swirly,” Morgan said. “Normally it’s just a gust straight one way or the other but when you see one flag going one way and one flag going straight up it’s like, ‘What? What do you do?’”That ended up being the only field goal attempt for Morgan in the game, and it didn’t go without some interpretive controversy.NCAA rule 8-4, Article 1, subsection b specifies that “If a legal field goal attempt passes over the crossbar between the uprights … it shall score a field goal.”Between is the operative word, but it’s also the word that is up for debate. The referee ruled that the field goal would have hit the upright and deemed the try no good. NCAA rule 12-3, Article 1, subsection b rules that field goals are reviewable “if and only if the ball is ruled … (b) inside or outside the uprights when it is lower than the top of the uprights. If the ball is higher than the top of the uprights as it crosses the end line, the play may not be reviewed.”Because of the height of the kick, Georgia head coach Mark Richt was unable to challenge.“I should have made it more clear to be good,” Morgan said.

4-Nov-14,Column: Georgia football still a step away from elite,"Although it was from a comedic movie and the quote often gets made fun of, Ricky Bobby’s “If you ain’t first, you’re last” statement holds true to sports. The ultimate goal of teams every year, no matter what sport, age group or gender, is to win it all.Teams that came close, no matter how dominant, may be remembered, but they aren’t etched in as some of the greatest teams of all time. The Buffalo Bills of the early 1990’s reached the Super Bowl for four consecutive years, a feat that probably won’t be repeated for a very long time.However, the Bills could not win a single championship in those years and left the fans thinking, 'Does this game even matter if we constantly lose?' After all, when thinking of a successful team’s history, you think of how many times they’ve hoisted the trophy, not how many times they’ve played in the final game, only to end up losing.


 


The Georgia football team see themselves slipping into a very similar territory, consistently being one of the better teams in the nation, but never the very best. The last time the Bulldogs were national champions was all the way back in 1980, when the majority of the enrolled students weren’t even born yet. Yet it’s funny to think that a team on a championship drought lasting over 30 seasons is still considered one of the best football programs in the nation.Since Georgia last won a national championship, a Southeastern Conference school has been crowned champion 10 times, with Alabama winning four, Florida winning three, LSU two and Auburn one. So what’s holding the Bulldogs back?First off, let me say this is not a call for coach Mark Richt to be fired, but there are things to note. One of the biggest knocks on him has been the ability to win the important games. Since Richt was hired in 2001, the Bulldogs have won their division six times, but only gone on to win the conference twice. They almost always have a top-10 recruiting class. But that last hump still seems insurmountable.Winning it all is something that Richt can’t say he has accomplished as a head coach, but he still holds a very strong record at Georgia with eight seasons of 10 or more wins, and a winning percentage of .737. But what does that all mean when there’s a zero in the national titles won column? In most fans’ eyes, it means nothing.Another program to look at in comparison is Virginia Tech under the tutelage of Frank Beamer. Having been there since 1987, Beamer regularly has his team fighting for the Atlantic Coast Conference Championship. Across his tenure, Beamer currently has 228 wins and is the winningest-active coach in the FBS but has never won a national title.Across the previous 10 seasons, the Hokies went to the ACC Championship six times, winning four of those. If you were to ask people to judge which program is a better at football, I would assume Georgia would be the favorite. However, comparing the résumés says something different.Both of these programs compete, but can’t get over the hump. They aren’t mediocre, but they definitely aren’t elite.Everyone loves watching our Bulldogs in Sanford Stadium on Saturdays, hoping that this is the season that we consider ourselves the best in the nation. But the past has shown us that we haven’t been able to make that claim in a long time.


 


Maybe fans are holding our standards too high. Maybe a 10-win season is a good season for the Bulldogs, and people should hold our heads high rather than be disappointed that Georgia didn’t win it all. The Bulldogs are a great football team, no question, but something is missing, and they haven’t found that missing piece in over three decades.",Robbie Dunn,sports,https://www.redandblack.com/sports/column-georgia-football-still-a-step-away-from-elite/article_23e02092-6440-11e4-81a8-0017a43b2370.html

2. Same-sex marriagePutting pressure on the Supreme Court: A federal appeals court ruled on Thursday that gay marriage bans in four states were constitutional. Some experts are expecting same-sex couples from Ohio, Michigan, Kentucky and Tennessee to appeal the ruling from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 6th Circuit. If this action is set in motion, experts expect the issue of gay marriage to return to the Supreme Court in the spring.3. Republican Party'More the direction I want the country to go:' Some voters say they believe the Republican Party will move the country in the direction it needs to be.

12-Nov-14,If Georgia football players hooped: Lorenzo Carter headlines players with two-sport potential,"With the Georgia basketball season starting on Friday against Georgia Tech, and the football team playing Auburn this weekend, football and basketball beat writer Connor Riley put together his ideal basketball lineup of football players. Guard: Damian SwannSwann is essentially the point guard of the defense as he often moves around and makes sure that the rest of the secondary is in position. His experience as both a corner and a safety would make him a great defensive point guard and he has the instincts and athleticism for him to be a good offensive player.


 


Guard: Malcolm MitchellMitchell’s time as a defensive back and a wide receiver show that he is a capable two-way player. Playing wide receiver will allow him to play off-ball and given his route running skills will translate to him make plenty of cuts and running off of screens.Forward: Jonathon RumphRumph is one of the best athletes on the team and while he is not the most refined player, Rumph could function as a guy who lives in transition. He has tons of natural athletic ability and would make plenty of highlight dunks and blocks. Also at 6-foot-5 he has the height to guard both guards and other forwards.Forward: Lorenzo CarterCarter played basketball at Norcross high school where he won a championship in 2013. At 6-foot-6, Carter has the size to play the position and while he might not be to handle physical players, his speed and athleticism will create matchup nightmares.Center: Jay RomeRome actually played basketball for Georgia and while he has been hobbled by foot and ankle injuries, something many NBA centers have struggled with, he is a hulking 6-foot-6 and 254 lbs. and should be able to defend other centers. His hands as a tight end will also help him finish around the basket while also using his blocking abilities to set monster screens.


 


Bench: Isaiah McKenzieA Russell Westbrook-type player. May drive Mark Fox crazy, but the freshman will make plenty of wow plays, while also committing some dreadful turnovers.Bench: Leonard FloydWhile having a similar build to Carter, Floyd would sub in for Rumph as he would be a better defensive player than Rumph. Could also play with Carter to create a crazy athletic front line.Bench: Michael BennettBennett would back Mitchell. While he is not as athletic as Mitchell, his route running skills would make a him nightmare for opposing defensesBench: Jeb BlazevichBlazevich would provide cover for Rome when he gets into foul trouble or if and when Rome gets hurt. While not as athletic, the freshman would excel in the little areas of the game.

14-Nov-14,Georgia volleyball tops Missouri for second time,"Georgia has four Southeastern Conference wins this season, and two are victories over Missouri.The Georgia Bulldogs (12-14, 4-10) defeated the Missouri Tigers (15-14, 6-8) in five sets (25-19, 25-27, 23-25, 25-17, 15-11) on Friday, Nov. 14 in Columbia, Missouri.In the all-time series, Georgia now leads Missouri by a narrow 4-3 margin. The two teams last faced off on Oct. 5 in Athens, Ga. when the Bulldogs won 3-2.


 


In the first set, Georgia maintained a lead throughout. The Tigers got as close as 8-7. but the Georgia offense pulled ahead to seal the 25-19 set win. The Bulldog offense ended with a .300 efficiency combined.Missouri started to take shape in the second and third sets. Both, however were close with Georgia never falling far behind and the defense staying gritty.In the fourth set, both teams battled late into the match. The Bulldogs held a 12-11 lead and then went on a 5-0 run. The run was enough of an advantage to send the game to five sets.The fifth and final set, Georgia took a commanding 10-4 lead. The Tigers rallied back within four points, but the Bulldogs sealed the set with a 15-11 set victory, and the 3-2 match win.Georgia returns to action on Sunday when the Bulldogs travel to Tuscaloosa, Ala. to face the Crimson Tide in the rematch of a game on Sept. 24 in Athens, Ga.

15-Nov-14,Live blog: No. 15 Georgia versus No. 9 Auburn,"Georgia football beat writer Cody Pace is live from Sanford Stadium and will be updating this live blog periodically. Check back for updates during the game.Final: Georgia 34, Auburn 7Offensive player of the game: Nick Chubb


 


There's not much here to explain. Chubb had nearly 150 yards and two touchdowns on the ground and was dominant for the Bulldogs all afternoon.Defensive player of the game: Amarlo HerreraHerrera had 12 tackles, a tackle for loss and an interception. That interception, even though it shouldn't have been caught, ended a scoring opportunity for Auburn and effectively sealed the game. Herrera was a close pick over Jordan Jenkins who also had a good game, but was all over the field and was a big part of stopping the Auburn rush attack.Play of the game: Auburn's fumbled punt return, first quarterGeorgia had been stagnant before this play and had to punt. If Auburn holds on to the ball here and was able to go up 14-0, we're quite possibly looking at a different outcome, or at least one that is much, much closer.Q4 2:01: With that fumble recovery for Georgia, Auburn is all but done. Georgia has a chance to just run the clock and really only needs a first down or two to seal the deal. Looks like Georgia is going to pull off the upset.Q4 4:51: Chubb just delivered what may have been the finishing blow to Auburn with his second rushing touchdown of the day. As nice as the drive was for Georgia, eating a large chunk of the clock, Gurley was injured on the drive and has been examined on the trainer's table for a some time. There's no indication of the severity of the injury, but it is doubtful that Gurley gets back in the game with Georgia leading 34-7.Q4 11:25: Amarlo Herrera gives maybe the most pivotal play in the game with an interception in the red zone. He should have knocked it down with it being fourth down, but Georgia getting the ball back in this situation with a 20 point lead is big for the Bulldogs. Expect a lot of run plays and attempts to eat time off the clock.


 


Q3 0:55: Chubb has been pivotal for Georgia today. Even though the touchdown was called back, that play is still the difference between a punt and three points. Georgia extends its lead to 27-7.Q3 7:28: Gurley has finally punched the ball in for his first touchdown courtesy of a 3-yard rush to the outside off the right side. Georgia now leads 24-7.Halftime thoughts: Yes, Georgia has looked good to this point, but it could have done a lot better and Auburn is definitely still in this one. It helps that Georgia gets the ball back to start the half, but the defense is going to have to continue to force Auburn into third downs and be able to make the occasional stop there. Don't forget, Auburn has been one of the most explosive offenses in the country and hasn't shown that so far, so it's at least possible that the second half looks a lot different for the Tigers' offense.The other big question mark is Todd Gurley, who has been mostly average thus far on his 13 carries with just around 4 yards per carry. Will offensive coordinator Mike Bobo try to get Gurley more involved, or will the Bulldogs continue to feed the hot hand with Nick Chubb. This first offensive drive will be telling for Georgia.Q2 0:29: Chris Conley has had several drops on the evening, including another one in the end zone that would have given Georgia a two touchdown lead going into the half. Instead, Marshall Morgan nails the field goal and Georgia leads 17-7.Q2 2:24: Another special teams gaffe by Auburn gave Georgia a first down after a punt ended with a questionable roughing call. Georgia now has a chance to drain the clock and score before the half.Q2 8:48: Georgia head coach Mark Richt gets a lot of heat for not being aggressive, but he's already faked a punt and gone for it on fourth down in chip-shot field goal range. It almost paid off the first time and it did work, and then some, on the second attempt with a Nick Chubb 9-yard run. Georgia leads 14-7. Q1 2:15: Georgia ties it up in a crazy first quarter with a Malcolm Mitchell catch on a slant. Gurley had an 11-yard carry to put the Bulldogs inside the 10-yard line for his first positive carry of the night. He has 9 yards on four carries. Georgia and Auburn tied 7-7.


TNCMS.AdManager.render({region: 'fixed-big-ad-bottom-asset', slot: 1, fold: ""below""});


Q1 3:17: Special teams have been a theme early. A Colin Barber punt on 4th-and-13 ends in a muff and a Georgia recovery, so now Georgia gets a really good chance on the 19-yard line to put its first points on the board.Q1 4:43: Georgia's defense just came up with a huge stop and a bad Auburn punt gives the Bulldogs solid starting field position. Although it's still early, getting down to Auburn 14-0 is dangerous territory. Georgia now has a chance to bring it even or at least get some points on the board.Q1 8:57: A crazy first drive just got crazier. Gurley returned the kickoff for a touchdown only to be called back on a Ryne Rankin holding. Then Georgia, forced to punt, fakes it and Adam Erickson throws it for a long pass to the 3-yard line, only to be called back on an illegal receiver downfield on long snapper Nathan Theus. All of that gives Georgia zero points and Auburn a chance to develop an early lead.Q1 10:52: The Georgia defense made Auburn work for it early in its first drive, but the Tigers were able to bounce Cameron Artis-Payne to the outside and punch it in from 26 yards out for the first touchdown of the game. Auburn leads 7-0.7:18 p.m.: Auburn wins the toss and elects to receive the ball, so the Georgia defense will immediately get a chance to stack up against the potent Auburn run game. Current temperature is 35 degrees and is sure to drop throughout the game and will be a factor to watch as the game develops, especially if either team is in a situation where it has to throw the football.6:55 p.m.: Starting lineups were just announced and, as expected, Gurley's ovation was loud. The press box actually vibrated slightly and you could not hear Gurley's name announced as the fans started when ""Tarboro, North Carolina"" was announced.6:43 p.m.: Todd Gurley has been shown often on the jumbotron and has received a large ovation from fans each time. It seems that tailback counterpart Keith Marshall is not dressed and will not play. Freshman Sony Michel will, however, test a bad ankle that has kept him out of practice all week.",Cody Pace,sports,https://www.redandblack.com/sports/live-blog-no-georgia-versus-no-auburn/article_b7856f2a-6d17-11e4-9bfb-bb8f6f8301e8.html
16-Nov-14,Over the Dog Years: Marine Sciences pool a dive back into pre-Ramsey times,"Before the Ramsey Student Center was constructed in 1995, University of Georgia students swam at two lesser-known, historical pools in the basement of the Marine Sciences Department building.“I don’t know if it’s still there or not, but there was a pool in the basement of Marine Sciences,” said Harvey Humphries, senior associate head coach for UGA’s men’s and women’s swim teams. “Back then, it was women’s [physical education], so the [P.E.] classes were taught there or in Stegeman Hall.”Stegeman, Humphries said, was similar to Ramsey. There were basketball courts, two racquetball courts and a small weight room, in addition to classrooms.


 


“The first pool built [at UGA] was Stegeman pool. It is underneath what is now the Tate Center,” Humphries said.Associate Research Scientist for UGA’s Center for Applied Isotope Studies Scott Noakes handled the Marine Sciences pool for a decade and said it dates back to the 1930s. The art-deco pool, however, is still intact and complete with a diving board.But the Bulldogs' original pool was more than just a place to cool off — Humphries said the Stegeman pool was used as a training facility by the United States Navy in 1939 to prepare for World War II.“They would climb up the ladders [to the catwalks] and jump off. The catwalks were supposed to simulate the height of the deck of the ship from the water,” he said. “We hung ropes from [the catwalks] and our athletes climbed ropes to the top in their bathing suits and back down for part of the training.”Humphries said Stegeman Hall’s pool was one of the fastest pools of its time. A “fast pool” refers to turbulence created by swimmers’ waves. In a deeper pool, the waves go to the bottom and take longer to dissipate, whereas in a shallower pool the waves bounce back up, creating more turbulence.“It was an interesting pool,” Humphries said. “Some of the fastest meets were done in that pool. There were American records set; NCAA [records] were broken there in the [1970s]. Billy Forrester — who was an Olympic bronze medalist — we watched him break the American record in the 200 butterfly there when I was swimming.”Brian Binder, department head and associate professor of marine sciences, said Stegeman was used by more people than just swimmers.“This used to be the Women’s P.E. building. That’s why dance is attached,” he said. “The department moved in around 1997. For a while we were intermingled with dance. We were teaching our lectures in the big gym. There was a big gym and locker rooms in the basement.”


 


However, parquet floors are all that remain of the former basketball courts in the dance building.

16-Nov-14,Richt didn't think of sitting Gurley in fourth quarter,"Following the news that junior running back Todd Gurley torn his ACL, head coach Mark Richt addressed the issue and praised Gurley for his contributions to the team.“It’s sad news,” Richt said. “He’s without a doubt one of the best running backs I’ve ever coached. He practiced hard, played hard, and loved the big games.”Richt said – to the best of his knowledge - Gurley did not suffer the injury earlier in the game, but following his final six-yard run with five minutes remaining, with Georgia enjoying a 20-point lead. Richt said he hadn’t entertained the idea of resting Gurley on that last drive.


 


“Even a year ago we were down 21 in the fourth and came back,” Richt said. “They have an explosive offense and we were trying to seal the deal.”Richt said freshman running back Sony Michel was warming up before the game but the decision to keep him inactive came after he expressed some reluctance in the locker room following pregame warm-ups.“He had gotten better and better everyday and we were hopeful in the pregame warm-up he would look good,” Richt said. “I asked him how he felt and you could see that there was hesitancy in his mannerisms. You could tell he didn’t feel like he was ready.”Due to official visits for recruiting, Georgia didn’t hold its regular coaching staff meeting on Sunday, so they had not discussed the possibility of returning J.J. Green to the running back possession.Georgia linebackers Amarlo Herrera and Ramik Wilson had plenty of success stopping Auburn’s rushing attack, and Richt said their success had a lot to do with the effectiveness of Georgia’s down linemen.“From what I’m seeing [in the game film] our down linemen did a great job of maintaining their gap integrity and forcing guys to move them with double teams,” Richt said. “When you linebackers make tackles it usually means you had a good day. When your safeties are making all the tackles it means you’ve had a rough day at the office.”For now Georgia looks towards Charleston Southern and Georgia Tech to close out the season, but Georgia will need some help from either Tennessee or Arkansas to beat Missouri at least once to give the Bulldogs a Southeastern Conference Championship berth.“We have an early game [on Saturday],” Richt said. “Hopefully I’ll be settled in at home in my lounge chair cheering for the Vols. Whether or not I wear orange or not is up in the air.”

16-Nov-14,Georgia volleyball loses to Alabama in three sets,"After losing in three sets to the Alabama Crimson Tide, the Georgia volleyball team moves to 12-15 on the year and 4-11 in the Southeastern conference.The Bulldogs struggled to find a rhythm and only scored a combined 28 points in the first two sets before narrowly losing in the final set, 25-21.In the first set, Georgia quickly climbed into a 10-4 deficit and was forced to take an early timeout. Although Alabama service errors contributed to the Bulldogs’ cause, two service aces helped the Crimson Tide on their way to a 25-13 win.


 


Georgia kept things close to start the second set, tying the score at 6-6. However, Alabama went on to score six unanswered points and force a Georgia timeout. Back-to-back kills by senior outside hitters Lauren Teknipp and Tirah Le’au brought the Bulldogs within seven at 17-10, but they could not keep pace with the Crimson Tide who took the set 25-15.The third set was more competitive. Georgia again fell behind 10-4, but three straight kills helped the Bulldogs avoid a larger deficit. Kills by outside hitter Amanda Dachs and middle blocker Desiree McCray coupled with an Alabama error brought the Bulldogs within four, trailing 21-17. Although Georgia scored three points in a row and held the Crimson Tide at match point, Alabama managed the last point of the set, winning the match 25-21 and the set 3-0.Offensively, the Bulldogs saw little success against the Crimson Tide. Teknipp led the team with seven kills but hit at just a .143 efficiency, with McCray close behind her with five kills hitting at a .500 efficiency.Defensively, middle blocker Jasmine Eatmon led the team with three blocks, and libero Gaby Smiley recorded 12 digs.",Sarah Spencer,sports,https://www.redandblack.com/sports/georgia-volleyball-loses-to-alabama-in-three-sets/article_f9ac9088-6e0f-11e4-9d3a-fbcef4e389d1.html
17-Nov-14,Georgia volleyball tries to stay competitive despite struggles,"Just one year after the Georgia Volleyball team earned its first NCAA Tournament bid since 2004, the Bulldogs find themselves struggling to get back in.Georgia (12-15, 4-11) lost some key seniors in players like Brittany Northcutt. This season, the Bulldogs’ Rating Percentage Index (RPI) stands at 123, and though the NCAA decides what RPI means for the tournament, Georgia must have a .500 record to even be eligible for the at large bid.“I think at this point in the season, we need to finish out as strong as we can,” head coach Lizzy Stemke said. “Right now, we need to be the best Georgia we can be each and every night.”


 


Stemke understands the NCAA will analyze RPI how they will, so her main focus continues to be competing everyday. Stemke said whether it’s an outside hitter drill, a passing drill or a six on six, the Bulldogs need to make sure competitive spirit days high in the gym.Georgia has lost 12 games this season by the score of 3-0 or 3-1, which means very little of the Bulldogs' losses were pushed to the full five sets.Stemke said this years squad has shown a lot of resiliency which is key to the culture of volleyball she is trying to build in Athens. The culture consists of working hard day in and day out. Stemke said continuing to stay competitive everyday is the first step in expecting to win more or even all the time.“We’re not letting those results effect how we come in and work the next day,” Stemke said. “That’s a very important piece to our culture to stay competitive. There’s a process there that starts with making sure you give everything you have day in and day out.”Senior outside hitter Tirah Le’au was a major part of the Tournament squad last year and said the main different is maturity. Le’au said last years team played together for three years and knew each other well.Though the season’s end looms with only six matches left, Le’au and Stemke still spin the rest of the season in a positive way.“Obviously looking at our record it can be very discouraging,” Le’au said. “The easy way out is to give up. But she (Stemke) tells us to play with pride because that’s all she can really ask for. We want to end our season and senior year on a note where we gave it our all and we can sleep at night with no regret.”",Sammy O'Brien,sports,https://www.redandblack.com/sports/georgia-volleyball-tries-to-stay-competitive-despite-struggles/article_441ffbb8-6e6b-11e4-a176-ab62abdbab1b.html
20-Nov-14,Todd Gurley's draft stock likely falling,"With one play, the entire trajectory of Georgia junior tailback Todd Gurley’s career changed.Doing something he had done 509 other times in his career, Gurley went from a sure-fire first-round NFL draft pick with Heisman-level talent to a question mark on a scout’s clipboard. Carry 510, which ended with a tear to Gurley’s left anterior cruciate ligament, not only likely ended his college career, but cost him valuable draft stock and millions of dollars.But maybe worst of all for Gurley — he didn’t have to do it. He could have stopped at carry 481, not returned from his four-game suspension and ridden off into the sunset to the first round and a multi-million dollar contract.


 


“That’s kind of where the unfortunate irony of the whole thing is,” said Dane Brugler, senior NFL draft analyst for NFLDraftScout and CBS Sports. “Talking to scouts, a four-game suspension, they didn’t care at all because that’s four less games they had to worry about him taking hits on that body. If he would’ve sat out, it would not have been a detriment to his draft stock.”Gurley can no longer take back his 29 carries against Auburn, making his only option to look ahead. While Gurley could look to return to the Bulldogs in 2015 and try to regain his first-round form, Brugler said that going to the NFL is the way to go.Brugler made the comparison to former South Carolina running back Marcus Lattimore, who suffered his first ACL tear his sophomore season before re-tearing it his junior season, along with several other ligaments. Had Lattimore been eligible to come out as a sophomore, even after that first ACL tear, he probably would have been a second- or third-round pick.“There’s so many more pros to going pro than returning to school,” Brugler said. “I think all Georgia fans even can sympathize with that. You don’t want to see Gurley get another injury and then not even have a chance at the NFL game. At least going now, Gurley has a chance to be in the NFL.”Similarly, Gurley slots somewhere from the second to third round, depending on how his knee has progressed between now and the NFL Combine when teams can medically evaluate the injury.“I think a lot of it will depend on, assuming he declares, when he goes to the combine and goes through the medical evaluation there,” Brugler said. “He won’t be working out physically before the draft but just to see, for teams to see how his rehab is going, I think that will really play a big part of where his projection will end up being.”Even with the injury, Gurley is still likely to be one of the most sought-after running backs in a talented class that could feature Wisconsin’s Melvin Gordon, Nebraska’s Ameer Abdullah, Alabama’s T.J. Yeldon, Miami’s Duke Johnson and Indiana’s Tevin Coleman.Where Gurley could begin to see his stock slip is whether or not teams view those options, with lesser talent, as better draft picks than Gurley with a questionable knee.


 


“If I’m a team that needs a running back, do I take a chance on a kid coming off an ACL or do I take a player that maybe isn’t quite as talented as Gurley, but at least I know he’s healthy?” Brugler said. “That’s where it’s really going to become an interesting dynamic among teams.”It’s not all doom and gloom for Gurley, either.While he is definitely going to take a tumble in the draft, he was probably not going to be a top 10 draft pick simply because running backs aren’t as valuable in the NFL because of injury concerns and because more teams are moving to a running back by committee approach.Not only does this mean that Gurley won’t be expected to take 25 or more carries from day one, the amount of money he’s losing under the new Collective Bargaining Agreement amounts to $3 million or $4 million as opposed to the tens of millions he would have lost before the NFL instituted a cap on rookie salaries.“The running back position is volatile and it’s something that ... the evolution of the running back position has been very interesting” Brugler said. “We’re not going to see the running back position get those long-term deals anymore.”",Cody Pace,sports,https://www.redandblack.com/sports/todd-gurley-s-draft-stock-likely-falling/article_faebe4de-7068-11e4-ba1e-33521dd5d9c1.html
20-Nov-14,Volleyball seniors mother overcomes breast cancer,"Among the people of Samoan decent, family or “aiga” remains an essential value to the culture of its people.In the case of Inutiraha ‘Tirah’ Le’au her Samoan heritage can be seen on her body in the form of tattoos, on paper in the shape of her name and through her aiga, both in California by blood and in Athens by choice.Le’au, a senior outside hitter and co-captain on the Georgia volleyball team hails from Duarte, California, just south of Los Angeles. Le’au grew up in a tight-knit, Samoan family consisting of her mother Bell, her father and her brother. Le’au’s close family expanded a little more when she decided to play volleyball 3,000 miles away for the University of Georgia.


 


“When I came out here, the whole Southern hospitality and family got to me,” said Le’au. “They had your back on and off the court.”Being from California, Le’au brought with her a feisty personality on the court, and more fun-loving character off the court. Le’au’s coaches and teammates have admired her spirit over the last four years.“She’s a kid that stops by our office, almost daily, to give hugs,” Georgia head coach Lizzy Stemke said. “She’s just a kid that loves connection. I think she really bought in to the family atmosphere we have going here. She epitomizes it with everything she does.”Le’au’s play on the court alone has helped too. This season, Le’au leads the Bulldogs in attacks, points, kills and serves. Le’au was also named captain by Stemke because of what a great teammate she has been.Stemke said Le’au considers the feelings of others and is considerate to the type of culture she wants to leave behind.Because Le’aus family resides in California, her parents have not been able to make a trip to Athens in Le’aus four years at Georgia.When the team traveled to California in August, it marked the first time Le’au’s father was able to see his daughter compete on the court since her freshman year, when the Georgia squad played in a match at Pepperdine.“It was exhilarating,” Le’au said. “It was like a flashback from high school because my dad usually took me. I looked back and felt like a young player. It was cool to show him in person what a mature player I had become since my freshman year.”


 


For most of Le’au’s college career, any family-related matters seemed small compared to the far distance. But just a couple months ago, one matter arose which made the distance seem much further.In October, Le’au’s mother was diagnosed with breast cancer.Luckily for the Le’au family, doctors found the cancer in its first stage, which was the size of a pea.One month ago, Le’au’s mother underwent her first surgery, and a week later, a second just to take out excess tissue for safety.“The worst part for me was being away, being literally across the country,” Le’au said. “Just keeping up with her it was knowing that she was strong and she was holding up okay made me strong and hold up as well.”Le’au also admitted the waiting game of it all has been hard. Le’au said Stemke and the coaches offered her time off to go visit her mother, but with the cost of flights for a one-day trip, it was just not economical.Le’au refuses to let it effect her play on the court and leadership responsibilities to her team.Stemke said Le’au built a contagious and lasting legacy here at Georgia. Stemke and Le’aus teammates know how much she means to the Bulldog family, and Le’au could not be more grateful to be apart of it.

Le’au finishes up her senior year in the spring and will either undergo a fifth year as a graduate student in the UGA social work program, or coach for a club volleyball team.Either way, Le’au will never forget the aiga she leaves behind. On Nov. 18, Le’au found out her mother Bell was cancer free.Bell will begin radiation and kemo therapy shortly. Le’au will see her mother for the first time since finding out she had cancer, over Christmas break.“I’m very relieved and thankful,” Le’au said. “We’ve been praying a lot. I sent a text out to my team thanking them, because in reality they are who I spend most of my time with. They sent her [Bell] cards and supported her too. I would not have been able to go through this without them.",Sammy O'Brien,sports,https://www.redandblack.com/sports/volleyball-seniors-mother-overcomes-breast-cancer/article_114416e6-70cf-11e4-b5ab-47b3349be2cb.html
21-Nov-14,Film study: Multiple defensive packages push Georgia past Auburn,"Though it only spans back to January, defensive coordinator Jeremy Pruitt’s tenure at the University of Georgia has already found its theme: multiplicity. Since his arrival at the school, Pruitt’s main preaching point has been the existence of his multiple defense. In effect, a “multiple” defense is one that cannot be reduced to a formation like a 4-3 or a 3-4. In those sets, the numbers denote how many defenders play on the defensive line, followed by how many linebackers are on the field. Those are what are referred to as base defenses. And while Pruitt’s multiple defense does indeed have a base, it does not stick to it for very long.Take last Saturday’s 34-7 rout over then No. 9 Auburn, a team that entered the contest not having been held under 20 points in the entire tenure of head coach Gus Malzahn. Georgia’s defense adapted by finding a successful string of substitution packages and relying upon those situationally to slow down Auburn’s vaunted offense.In short-distance situations, Georgia’s defensive back eight appeared as such: Ramik Wilson and Amarlo Herrera served as inside linebackers while Jordan Jenkins and Lorenzo Carter played outside linebacker. Regularly a starting outside linebacker, sophomore Leonard Floyd bumped outside to the “star” position, a hybrid outside linebacker and defensive back that plays close to the line of scrimmage but outside of the box. Because Floyd played effectively as an extra linebacker, the team only lined three defensive backs on the field with a one-high safety look.


 


Damian Swann and Devin Bowman usually were the cornerbacks in this situation with Dominick Sanders, usually the team’s star, lined up as the high safety. In playing with all five of the team’s strongest linebackers on the field at once, this limited what Auburn could do horizontally, as there was more size and aggression everywhere on the field. More specifically, Jenkins’ job in this set was paramount. Jenkins was more often than not the read key that Auburn quarterback Nick Marshall read to decide whether or not to keep the ball or hand it off. Since Jenkins had been taught all week according to Georgia head coach Mark Richt to give Marshall the “give” key, Auburn was forced to continually pound the ball up the middle where Georgia’s biggest players and most reliable tacklers sat ready for more action.When these sets worked, Georgia relied on a weird quirk in the rule book to substitute into its long-distance defense. By college football rules, when an offense makes a substitution, a defense by rule can take as much time as it needs to counter with a substitution of its own.Whenever Auburn moved into its longer sets, Georgia substituted as follows: Bowman ran off the field in favor of Aaron Davis, who took over his role as a cornerback. Carter hurried off the field in favor of fellow freshman Malkom Parrish who played the other cornerback position. Floyd moved inside from the star back into his natural outside linebacker position. As Parrish was on the field to play cornerback, Swann moved into a position that appeared as if it were a blended star and safety.This substitution package emphasized rushing the passer with the team’s best rushers while also putting aggressive defensive backs on the field who could quickly recover if an Auburn receiver snuck behind them. Since Auburn’s long-distance strategy is often to heave a ball deep to one of its many gifted and athletic receivers, Parrish and Davis were on the field as sure tacklers and athletes capable of tracking down offenders in space. This set slowed Auburn, especially on third down. Though the Tigers finished the game 8-for-14 on third down, this trend reads quite differently when considering the Tigers were only 3-for-8 on third downs in the last three quarters. Auburn was stuffed on some short-distance plays, but the long-distance packages worked toward the game’s end.",Nick Suss,sports,https://www.redandblack.com/sports/film-study-multiple-defensive-packages-push-georgia-past-auburn/article_aad3d59e-7192-11e4-9aca-3b30ca76eaed.html
29-Nov-14,Georgia's seniors leave haunted legacies on the field in loss to Georgia Tech,"Quarterbacks have short memories. It’s a well-accepted theory. When a quarterback makes a mistake, he trots back on the field and plays the next down.But sometimes there isn’t another down.Hutson Mason is that sometimes. Mason doesn’t have another down. The senior quarterback will never take another snap in Sanford Stadium. He will never again attempt a throw or complete a pass or drop back or receive a snap on his home field as a Georgia Bulldog.


 


Because of this, Mason does not have a short memory. Because of this, Mason will be haunted for the rest of his days.“I mean, man, the only thing you’re ever going to remember for the rest of your life is that you threw a pick and you lost to Tech,” Mason said. “So everything else is meaningless.”In Georgia’s 30-24 overtime loss to Georgia Tech, Mason had the chance to be the hero. In fact, Mason was the hero. Mason led a 12 play, 69-yard drive in 2:23 at the end of regulation that silenced his in-state rivals and gave Georgia its final lead of the game. On a fourth down with the game riding on his shoulders, Mason channeled his inner Joe Montana, emulating the San Francisco 49ers legend in rolling backward and to his right and finding his receiver, in his case junior Malcolm Mitchell and not Dwight Clark, dragging across the end zone. Sanford Stadium erupted. He was the hero.But like many a tragic hero before him, Mason forgot that time was his fatal flaw. 18 seconds remained on the clock. And with those 18 seconds, so went his legacy.“It’s a sucky way to end your career,” Mason said. “To go from possibly the greatest finish and a storybook ending to your career to one of the worst ways to end your career. I don’t know. It stinks.”For Mason and the rest of Georgia’s seniors, that shift is how their last game at Sanford Stadium will be remembered. These seniors could have been a class that went four years and never lost to Florida. But that didn’t happen. Then it could’ve been a class that never lost to Georgia Tech. That didn’t happen either.With these watermarks on their legacies, it would be easy to assume that the players too believe that their legacies as a senior class are tainted. In the words of cornerback Damian Swann, that assumption is true.“It’s tough,” Swann said. “It’s tough. It’s something I’ve got to live with for the rest of my life. But I’ll get through. We’ll all get through.”


 


Merely getting through Saturday’s events may be harder for some than others. While players like Mason and Swann each contended that the pain of this loss will be remembered forever, others couldn’t help but be positive about what Saturday proved about this Georgia team and the senior class in general.One such player, senior punter Adam Erickson, said that despite the loss, this game exemplified the attitude that his senior class has carried itself with for the entirety of its reign.“I think over the past few years we really have gotten to a point where we’ll fight back no matter what,” Erickson said. “Like the Auburn game at Auburn with [Aaron] Murray, even after the Hail Mary we came back and had a chance to put it in the end zone. I’ll think back: We were kind of counted out there at the end and we never gave up and we made it a game. They made some plays to win it at the end, but we made it a game.”When he said that “we” made it a game, Erickson was obviously referring to the team as a whole. But he may as well been referring to the senior class as a microcosm. Swann returned a fumble 99 yards for a touchdown to give Georgia a lead. Senior defensive end Ray Drew recorded nine tackles and blocked two kicks, one of which in overtime. Senior inside linebackers Ramik Wilson and Amarlo Herrera recorded 19 tackles each and Herrera recovered a key fumble to give the Bulldogs a chance to win the game. And Mason, of course, made the team believe, if just for a moment, that it had won.To Drew, the importance and the pain of the loss outweighs how well he and his senior compatriots played.“We lost,” Drew said. “It’s all bitter. No matter whether I had 20 sacks or I had 15 blocked field goals. It’s all bitter. We lost.”By contrast, senior wide receiver Jonathon Rumph said the way the seniors performed should be remembered beyond just the loss.“It just lets you the definition of our team and how good we are and the type of horses that we have around each other, the type of dogs that we have around each other,” Rumph said. “I feel like they’re a great bunch. Even though we lost I feel we finished how we were supposed to.”


TNCMS.AdManager.render({region: 'fixed-big-ad-bottom-asset', slot: 1, fold: ""below""});


Rumph continued in saying that he feels everyone on the team left everything on the field, a metaphor used just as often in football as the idea of a quarterback having a short memory. Rumph said what he will remember being left on the field is the memories of his teammates, the “passion in their eyes.”But Drew left something else on the field.Drew left four years of pain, four years of work, four years of toil and four years of sweat on the field. Drew left his memories behind.“I believe I laid everything I had on the field today for not just myself because I’m not a selfish person but for Amarlo Herrera, for Ramik Wilson, for Toby Johnson, for Mike Thornton,” Drew said. “For all those guys that we’ve went through winter and summer workouts and all this pure hell trying to get to where we are. I laid everything out there today for them.”",Nick Suss,sports,https://www.redandblack.com/sports/georgia-s-seniors-leave-haunted-legacies-on-the-field-in/article_23bd7222-7818-11e4-9909-6bc4b30bd5df.html
4-Dec-14,"Gainesville pastor advocates blending of science, religion in final Anthropocene lecture","A Georgia pastor addressed the relationship between religion and science in a lecture at the University of Georgia on Thursday evening.William “Bill” Coates Jr. of the First Baptist Church of Gainesville delivered his talk, titled “Repairing the World: The Theological and Moral Perspective,” on at the Chapel as the eighth and final installment of this semester’s Anthropocene lecture series on climate change.On the melding of the scientific facts of environmental problems with the moral responsibility of the human race, Coates said there must be a vital meeting in the middle between the two opposing perspectives.


 


“Let us join the forces of religion and science. Religion and science have to work together,” he said. “There are many people in the scientific community with strong voices about what we need to do. There are many voices in the religious community that, unfortunately, [are] denying that there is anything wrong.”Coates said he believes humans should relate to nature with “hands up, with great joy and a gladness to be a part of it”.But rejoicing in nature is not the way humans have been interacting with the environment, he said.“Humans are the most dangerous animal in the world,” Coates said, quoting Bruce Larson.He said this is due to “dangerous interpretations” of biblical passages, such as the one that gives humans “dominion” over all other living things. “I would be very surprised if that is the way God was thinking when he gave us ‘dominion over living things,’” Coates said.There is nothing in the Bible that should be read as science or interpreted as such, he said.“It is not a scientific book. The Bible is not concerned with the ‘how’ — that is what scientists are asking. Religion is concerned with ‘why,’” Coates said. “I believe the idea that we have dominion over the earth definitely does not mean we can do what we want to it. But it means that we are stewards who had better take very good care of it.”


 


Emily Morris, a junior ecology and biology major from Marietta, said she agreed with Coates’ ideas. “I feel like there is a lot of dissent between religion and science, and we’ve talked about it in a lot of my classes, as I’m a science major. I think there should definitely be more discussion about this in the classroom,” she said.",Allie Dean @redandblack,uganews,https://www.redandblack.com/uganews/gainesville-pastor-advocates-blending-of-science-religion-in-final-anthropocene/article_3fce2742-7c2b-11e4-ae28-9724b6629b9a.html
9-Dec-14,4 Georgia players named to Coaches All-SEC teams,"Four University of Georgia football players were named to Coaches All- Southeastern Conference teams, including freshman tailback Nick Chubb, senior inside linebackers Amarlo Herrera and Ramik Wilson and senior cornerback Damian Swann.Leading Georgia with 1,326 regular-season rushing yards and 12 rushing touchdowns, Chubb was named to the Coaches All-SEC First Team. In his inaugural season, Chubb was also selected for the Associated Press All-SEC First Team and was named AP SEC Freshman of the Year. Chubb recorded 18 catches for 213 yards and two touchdowns this season.Herrera, Wilson and Swann were all named to the Coaches All-SEC Second Team defense.


 


With a team-leading 42 starts as a Bulldog, Herrera led Georgia in tackles with 112, good for No. 3 in the SEC and placing him 10th on Georgia’s all-time tackle records with 331. Herrera also contributed three sacks, ten tackles for loss and an interception.Wilson, who led the SEC in tackles last season with 133, averaged 8.5 tackles per game and tallied 102 tackles and six tackles for loss. Wilson added a forced fumble and recovered fumble.In addition to three interceptions and fumble recovery returned for a touchdown versus then- No. 15 Georgia Tech, Swann leads the SEC with four forced fumbles and has 62 tackles and 4.5 tackles for a loss this season.","Sarah Spencer

15-Dec-14,UGA Food Services balances meal plan cost with convenience,"While the meal plan at University of Georgia may be simple to understand and comparative to the price of other schools’ options, the convenience and quality it provides is what keeps students coming back.Bryan Varin, the interim executive director of UGA Food Services, said there are more than 8,700 students on meal plan, with about 90 percent selecting the seven-day plan. Additionally, he said, UGA Food Services surpassed its goals and increased last year’s numbers by more than 400 purchasers, which he attributed to the opening of the new Bolton and the addition of Sunday dinner service.The unlimited meal plan, which costs $3,956 for the full week and $3,754 for the five-day option, comes out to $4.97 and $7.33 respectively per meal, assuming a student goes to the dining halls three times a day for every possible day the dining halls are open.


 


“There are a lot of factors that go into determining the price we charge for the meal plan. There are food costs, labor costs, utilities, lease payments for things like vehicles, mortgages for Bolton and the construction of the Village Summit, and administrative overhead,” Varin said.Eating the costsWhile Varin said the meal plan prices usually increase 1 to 2 percent a year due to food costs, this year’s price did not change from the 2013 to 2014 school year.“This year we did not raise any of the rates. President Morehead gave an initiative to everyone to help with the cost of higher education across the board, so in supporting, that we did not raise our rates,” he said.Instead, UGA Food Services began a new program this year offering a 10 percent discount for students and employees who eat at dining halls on a walk-in basis.But for Aaron Klein, who lives off campus and budgets around $350 a month for food, it’s too hard to justify a meal plan.“I live a 10 minute drive from campus, and on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays I am done with classes at noon, so I want to go home, and it doesn’t make sense for me to then drive back to campus for dinner,” said Klein, a junior theater and advertising major from Dunwoody. “A 10 percent discount really doesn’t sway me. It is really not that much, and it could still be more than $10 for a meal whereas at home it would be $3.”Not as easily noticed though, there are other, intangible benefits that factor into the meal plan.


 


“I remember freshman year my roommate and friends went to Snellebrate and I was not able to go,"" said Melissa Jennings, who commuted to the grocery store her freshman year by public transit instead of participating in the meal plan. ""You also don’t always have time to cook on your own.”And Arjun Patel, a senior biology major from Macon who lives off-campus, said he still takes part in the meal plan because of the convenience.“I have been on the five-day all four years. I guess the primary reason is that it allows me to eat at all of the other food joints around Athens. It gives me a chance to try new things,” Arjun Patel said.Klein said he made the most of the unlimited dining option as a freshman.“I definitely went for my three meals a day, and then I would go one or two times apart from that just to grab a snack, and I went to Snelling late at night almost every night,” he said.How UGA differsUnlike some schools though, participation in UGA’s meal plans is voluntary.Emory University, the University of West Georgia, and Georgia Gwinnett College all require students living on campus to take part in a meal plan of some sort. Additionally, Georgia Institute of Technology requires students taking part in its Freshman Experience program to buy a meal plan, and Georgia State University has a mandatory meal plan for students who live in certain residence halls.

“Being voluntary is something we feel strongly about. We don’t want to tell anyone how to spend their money. We want to earn our sales through quality food and quality service,” Varin said.Jennings, a junior biochemistry and molecular biology major from Buford, said she spends about $50 a week on food, and her mom did not think it was necessary to pay for a meal plan as she had made food on her own during college.Varin said UGA Food Services, as an auxiliary service, receives no funding from the university or from the state and is instead financed entirely by selling plans and selling food in their retail locations such as Tate Cafe.UGA also differs from other institutions in that it only offers two meal plan options.University of Florida, for example, offers five and seven day plans but also has options for a declining balance card and flexible spending dollars for use at other on-campus eateries, such as Subway.Auburn University, which has meal plan requirement, offers a $600 a year plan for off-campus residents and charges students per item on a declining balance basis.“We are a pretty unique program in how we structure it and it being very simplistic. There are confusing plans out there with things like meal plan equivalencies, platinum and gold programs,” Varin said.Varin said that the unlimited plans at UGA offer students greater flexibility and are easier to manage.",Mollie Simon @mrsimon22,uganews,https://www.redandblack.com/uganews/uga-food-services-balances-meal-plan-cost-with-convenience/article_df1f1146-83f9-11e4-b6e0-9f0702dbeaa1.html
15-Dec-14,Florida State under suspicion of protecting guilty player for the sake of glory,"Following rape accusations, Jameis Winston's, Florida State football player, hearing was conveniently postponed just after the regular season ended. While his attorney, David Cornwell, claims he wanted time to review the evidence, it remains suspicious that the hearing was postponed in a way that enabled Winston to play out the remainder of the season.After two days, Judge Major Harding, who conducted the hearing, did not reach a decision or a definite time when a decision would be reached. Harding gave the defense and prosecutors five days to submit a proposal on what they think the outcome should be, and he will use this as a base for making a decision. Because Harding has 10 school days to report a decision, he does not have to report the decision until January 13th, one day after the national championship game.This raises further suspicion, as all of this is just too convenient for Winston's football schedule. Even if the hearing concludes before the 13th, Winston could ask for an appeal, which could keep Winston eligible to play.


 


Florida State is currently ranked 3rd and looking to defend their national title. I personally believe the postponed hearing is the perfect way for Winston to remain with the team as an asset to defend the national title. It’s shameful for the NCAA to allow Winston to continue to play after these allegations, let alone the fact that he committed other crimes, such as stealing crab legs, yet people such as Todd Gurley get suspended for four games after publicly apologizing.Even if the allegations were false, why would Florida State risk forfeiting all their wins for the season? Yes, Winston won the Heisman last year, but he is not the only player on the field for FSU. And if the allegations are true, Winston played the whole season living a lie.I’m all for the democratic way, of “innocent until proven guilty” but this situation is too serious to take that risk, and the whole situation of delaying the hearing makes it look like Winston is guilty.— Hannah Hancock is a freshman from Fayetteville majoring in sports management",Hannah Hancock,views,https://www.redandblack.com/views/florida-state-under-suspicion-of-protecting-guilty-player-for-the/article_94b3358a-7f38-11e4-a8ce-075eac28b4bd.html
17-Dec-14,Practice report: Mike Bobo at practice as expected,"Georgia held its first practice after its break for final exams Wednesday night in preparation for the Belk Bowl versus Louisville. The media was allowed 10 minutes of observation time. Here are the observations made by the Red & Black.
As Georgia coach Mark Richt said he would be during Wednesday's press conference, offensive coordinator Mike Bobo was in attendance and coaching the quarterbacks as he usually does. Bobo was the topic of discussion Wednesday after it was confirmed that he secured an interview for the head coaching vacancy at Colorado State left open by former coach Jim McElwain's departure for the same position at Florida.
Working with the quarterbacks, Bobo's drills today appeared to be rooted in the concept of speed. First, the quarterbacks practiced throwing short, precise passes to tight ends as they normally do to begin the media period of practice before working on throwing three or four consecutive passes from a quick snap. This drill looked to refine quick release and snap decision making.
The team appeared to be completely healthy as no player on either the offense or defense donned a non-contact green jersey. The team was dressed in full pads, but many players were wearing sweatpants over them as a result of the sub-50 degree temperature resulting from the late practice time. Whereas the team's regular practice time normally comes at around 4 p.m., Wednesday's practice began at 7:30.
After Richt confirmed Wednesday afternoon that sophomore outside linebacker Leonard Floyd underwent surgery and will be missing the bowl game, the outside linebackers became a topic of discussion. It appeared in practice that junior Jordan Jenkins and freshman Lorenzo Carter earned the first reps, but drills were done communally so the whole position group was participating. The group practiced forcing and recovering fumbles as one player ran with the football, another came from behind to rip the ball out and a third had to locate the loose ball, scoop it off the ground, change direction and sprint back toward the original line of scrimmage.

18-Dec-14,Mid-Year SGA Report Card: Grading DJB,"During their first semester in office, Drew Jacoby, Jim Thompson and Brittany Arnold began work on each of their campaign platforms as DJB. But to keep its promises to University of Georgia students, the administration will begin next semester with much work in order to complete those plans.The Student Government Association contributed to several changes on campus this semester, including the new wristband distribution system at football games and a new class withdrawal policy that no longer allows WFs, withdrawal-failing grades.While making positive steps to reform SGA, DJB did not end the semester with many tangible results on campus of its campaign platforms. How well does the administration stack up for the semester overall?


 


KEY:A–Platform point accomplishedB–Platform point in progressC–Platform point attempted but not accomplishedD–Platform point attempted and abandonedF–Platform point not attemptedSGA Accountability Reform: BThis semester, SGA focused on improving the accountability of its senators, making several changes to the legislative branch. A senate budget of $3,500 within the large SGA budget was created for the exclusive use of senators.


 


SGA reformed its legislative committees and created a legislative cabinet, with the goal of improving accountability and productivity of the body, said Thompson, SGA vice president.At the last senate meeting of the semester, senators passed a resolution defining the job requirements of senators, which now include meeting with their college dean, hosting a specific number of constituent events and attending two of their college functions each semester.“There are more expectations of senators than there have been in the past,” Thompson said. “But to that point, there have seldom been explicitly-stated responsibilities of senators in general. These changes have greatly improved the senate's efficacy.”Withdrawal Policy Change: AWith SGA’s support, the class withdrawal policy will change next semester to allow unlimited class withdrawals before the mid-semester deadline, removing the current WP/WF grading system.After the mid-semester deadline, students cannot withdraw from a class.“Up until the withdrawal deadline, which is two weeks after the midpoint, you can withdraw from any class as many times as you want, and you will get a generic W, which will not count against your GPA,” said Jacoby, SGA president. “But having attempted the class, it will still count as HOPE attempted hours.”University Council voted to approve the change at their meeting on Nov. 19.


TNCMS.AdManager.render({region: 'fixed-big-ad-bottom-asset', slot: 1, fold: ""below""});


Semester-long graduation preparation classes: CJacoby said members of SGA have met with the Office of Curriculum Systems and with administrators in the Office of the Vice President of Instruction about creating semester-long graduation preparation classes.While research is being done, Jacoby said the project is “still in the works.”However, no tangible progress has been made toward this initiative.Making study abroad more affordable: BDJB ran on a platform that included making study abroad opportunities more financially attainable, and so far they have worked with the Office of International Education and the Vice President of Development to promote scholarships.“I knew from personal experience that I was granted the ability to go abroad through a scholarship,” Jacoby said.Jacoby said “very valuable” scholarships go unused each year, so SGA will continue getting those advertised to students.

DJB plans to continue next semester trying to find new ways to ease the financial burden of studying abroad.Retroactive Pass/Fail System: DWhile running for election, DJB supported creating a retroactive pass/fail system that would allow students to replace a letter grade in a non-major class with a pass/fail grade.An issue with the system SGA found, however, was that it could potentially lead to grade inflation.“We are fairly certain that we’re letting the retroactive pass/fail system go,” Jacoby said. “It’s not because the administration wasn’t willing to work with us on it, but they explained to us why it is that their system is in place.”Inclusive Post-Secondary Education Initiative: BWorking with the J.W. Fanning Institute for Leadership Development, SGA hopes to bring to UGA a specialized postsecondary degree program, granting students with mental disabilities equal access to attend UGA.“When I entered office, I was most excited and nervous about pursuing this initiative,” Thompson said. “It was never my expectation that a specialized degree program of this sort would come to fruition in a year's time. But I was worried that the conversation would never gain traction. Fortunately, it has.”

SGA is planning a preview event for February to introduce the concept to the UGA community.Promoting SGA inclusivity: CIn past years, SGA has been accused of having an exclusive image, making it difficult for students outside of the organization to be involved.DJB promised when elected to work on making SGA a more inclusive organization and to reach out more the student body.This semester, SGA hosted SHOUT Week, during which senators tabled around campuses and at their colleges, talking to students about their concerns and what changes should be made at UGA.Jacoby said the week was a success, and senators spoke with hundreds of students.But beyond SHOUT Week, SGA has not yet accomplished its goal of being totally inclusive. Members at the last senate meeting expressed concern that the new elections timeline will discourage non-members to run in this year’s election.SGA plans to continue this effort next semester, Jacoby said.

“What I’m most proud of is how we’re making a number of positive steps to a more positive image on campus,” Jacoby said.",Lauren McDonald @laurenmcdonald2,uganews,https://www.redandblack.com/uganews/mid-year-sga-report-card-grading-djb/article_3faa6b50-86c0-11e4-a79a-3f6c54b71ecd.html
19-Dec-14,Practice report: Cornerbacks practice one-on-one coverage skills,"The Georgia football team held its final open practice in Athens of the 2014 season Friday. The media was allowed 10 minutes of observation time. Here are some observations made by the Red & Black. 
During the media available period, defensive coordinator Jeremy Pruitt and his defensive backs worked on the fundamentals of pass coverage in advance of Dec. 30th's Belk Bowl versus Louisville. With a group of eight cornerbacks, most notably 2014 regular season starters Damian Swann, Aaron Davis, Devin Bowman and Malkom Parrish, Pruitt stressed the concepts of sideline coverage. In this drill one cornerback would mock playing receiver and run a wheel route or a fade route down a sideline while another would try to trap that receiver against the sideline and jostle for the ball in the air. While this was happening, the safeties group worked on deep zone coverage and reacting to balls in mid air out of their drops.
Before this, the defensive backs as one group worked on open-field tackling. Throughout this drill, Pruitt could be heard reminding the players ""do not stop, do not stop."" This was an attempt to teach his players how to keep their feet moving before and during tackles.
In injury news, only one player wore a non-contact green jersey Friday: senior fullback Taylor Maxey. Looking healthy and of note was junior tailback Keith Marshall. Marshall was seen in practice wearing a bulky brace on his right knee and braces on both ankles, but he did participate fully in running back drills and even took the first reps in most drills due to his seniority among the backs.
Georgia's wide receivers spent the first three minutes of the press period working in a more physical capacity than they usually do, practicing running through tackles by simulating arm tackling with a gauntlet. The receivers were instructed to keep their momentum forward as to break through the many ""arms"" they were running toward.
The defensive backs weren't the only players who worked on intercepting passes, as the inside linebackers ran a drill where they had to run over a series of tackling dummies spaced equally on the ground to simulate low blockers, but keep their eyes up as a pass was coming their way. The linebackers appeared to thrive in this drill as no passes were dropped in the period the media was allowed to see.

9-Jan-15,Gym Dogs preview: Gymnastics season set to open in high-profile tilt versus Michigan,"Even though Georgia will be the only top-10 team in the nation to begin its season hosting another top-10 team, the Gym Dogs will not view the team rankings as added pressure.“We don’t like to use the word pressure,” junior Mary Beth Box said. “We like to say opportunity.”On Saturday, No. 7 Georgia will compete at home against No. 8 Michigan in what is the season opener of the second toughest schedule in the country.


 


Even though most top teams begin their season with a somewhat low-ranked opponent, Georgia head coach Danna Durante doesn’t mind opening alongside another one of the nation’s best.“There is no question going into SECs and going into regionals and nationals that we’re going to see the toughest competition,” Durante said. “For us to be able to see it right off the bat, see where we stack up, I think it’s a great thing. I have no desire to see somebody else who’s not going to test what we’re really going to see down the road.”Not only will the meet allow the Gym Dogs to preview the level of competition that will be present in the postseason, but a successful opener could also benefit the team’s results as the year progresses.The scores given in gymnastics can at times be prone to bias, and judges can unknowingly have presumptions before a gymnast even mounts the apparatus.“Unfortunately gymnastics is a bit of a subjective sport and how you start off in the gymnastics world kind of determines how judges look at you later on,” Box said. “Starting strong is really important to kind of show the world that we are in a great position to start off and they can expect great things now and even better things in the future.”To prepare for the event, the Gym Dogs have recently been given team-oriented assignments at practice. For example, the team as a whole might be required to land a certain number of routines or skills in a row.Since gymnastics at the Junior Olympic and elite level primarily has an individual focus, having experience with a team atmosphere is crucial for the underclassmen.“With 11 sophomores and freshmen, that’s something that they’re still learning,” Durante said. “What does that mean when my teammate has my back or what does it look like when I have hers, so they’re figuring that out.”


 


The meet will be the team’s first time competing in eight months and the freshmen’s first time ever performing in front of a large crowd in Stegeman Coliseum.Even though the freshmen had the opportunity to compete in the coliseum at the Sneak Peek in December, the attendance at the intrasquad was only a fraction of what it will be on Saturday.“A lot of excitement and a little bit of nerves, but it’s good,” freshman GiGi Marino said. “I think it’s more just adrenaline than nerves.”Just as the team strives to view pressure as opportunity, Durante hopes to turn the Gym Dogs’ perception of nerves into a feeling of excitement.“We’ve talked a lot about, ‘let’s enjoy this,’” Durante said. “This is an opportunity. Let’s enjoy this. Let’s figure out what we are going to be excited about. Not nervous. I don’t like that term, nervous. I like excitement.”Gymnasts to watch forGeorgia· In 2014, junior Brandie Jay scored a 9.9 or higher eight times on vault and seven times both on bars and floor.

10-Jan-15,Simple mistakes add up in Gym Dogs loss to Michigan,"As the meet progressed, small mistakes by the Gym Dogs added up and turned into costly errors as No. 7 Georgia was ultimately defeated by No. 8 Michigan 196.6-195.6 in the season opener.However, freshman Natalie Vaculik does not think the falters resulted from a lack of readiness.“In my opinion we were 100 percent prepared for this competition,” Vaculik said. “We’re strong on all events, and we had a couple slip-ups today, but it is just the first meet, so we’re looking to improve next weekend.”


 


A few steps on landings on vault and bars, the meet’s first two events, were followed by multiple minor wobbles on beam, and the meet finished on floor where the Gym Dogs were forced to count a fall.There wasn’t one event that was to blame for the defeat. Rather, it was essentially the result of the sum of many small errors.“It wasn’t necessarily one event that was stronger or weaker,” Georgia head coach Danna Durante said. “I mean, floor we didn’t finish well, but we had some good starts on every event and good finishes on every event.”Junior Brandie Jay’s 9.925 in the anchor position on vault turned out to be Georgia’s only score above a 9.9 all night, compared to Michigan’s four.Another primary difference between the overall team scores was Michigan avoided counting a fall.Since five of the six scores on each event count towards the team’s total, one five-tenth deduction for a fall has the potential to be rectified, but two or more falls will always prove costly.On floor, the meet’s final event, the Gym Dogs had two consecutive routines with falls from junior Mary Beth Box and sophomore Ashlyn Broussard.For Durante, this was not expected.


 


“Mary Beth on floor was a little bit of a surprise because she’s been rocking that,” Durante said. “She’ll work it out this week and be fine next week.""Box thinks that additional mental preparation can likely change the outcome.“I know I can do my routine fine,” Box said. “It’s just I got to redirect my mindset and kind of change some key words in my head right before I do some passes and get that all set up.”Despite these mistakes on floor, sophomore Kiera Brown scored a 9.85 on the event and both Jay and senior Sarah Persinger earned a 9.825.Persinger also scored a 9.8 on vault and beam making her one of the most consistent gymnasts of the night.“I think the mental discipline to focus on the simple key words and what you need to do to hit is so important,” Persinger said.Even though the Gym Dogs did have any falls on beam, the team had multiple routines with wobbles and finished the event with only three scores above a 9.8, including 9.85s from Box and freshman Vivi Babalis.“Beam is one of those events where you need to be very calm and collective,” Vaculik said. “So definitely going to work on that throughout the competitions and hopefully better next competition.”


TNCMS.AdManager.render({region: 'fixed-big-ad-bottom-asset', slot: 1, fold: ""below""});


On bars, Brown and senior Chelsea Davis each posted a 9.875, Georgia’s highest scores on the event.Despite being the team’s highest event total of the night, Georgia’s 49.125 on bars against Michigan was considerably lower than last year’s average of 49.485, which was the nation’s highest average in the event.Even when mistakes occur during competition, Durante attempts to keep everything as normal as possible.“They always say don’t get too chatty,” Durante said. “You can’t say more. It’s got to be the same. When you’re talking to them, it’s got to be the same tone, the same voice, the same look, the same things that you would say. They don’t need to try harder. They just need to do what they do.”According to Persinger, consistency will arrive when the team can disregard the outside world and only focus on its upcoming routines.“When it comes down to it, when it’s your turn to go, it’s just you and that piece of equipment and your routine,” Persinger said. “You can’t think about anything else but your gymnastics.”

12-Jan-15,"Students, professors put thought into classroom seat selections","For some students, in University of Georgia facilities designed to hold more than 200 people, there is only one seat that matters.During the first weeks of school, some students strategize the most optimal location to sit in the classroom and create unofficial seating charts for themselves.“Usually I choose the middle of the row, so that I can still see the board and it's not too far to the front or the back,” said Jennifer Tran, a freshman health services major from Atlanta. “It doesn’t make me as nervous as at the front seat, but it also doesn’t make me slack off as if I was in the back seats.”


 


Keleigh Prevatte, a master's student in accounting from Cedar Park, Texas, said she opts to sit toward the front of the classroom to stay engaged and pay attention.“I used to sit further back because I used to be afraid of sitting in the front, but in the past two years I moved to the front because I was having trouble and I found it helpful,” she said. “I feel it helps with participation because your self awareness with how people view you goes away, because you can’t see the people behind you. It feels like more of a one-on-one conversation with your professor. I’ve been participating a lot more and found that my grades are a lot higher.""But not all students have the option of choosing their own seats.Christopher Hanks, an entrepreneurship professor in the Terry College of Business, said utilizes a seating system that complements his lessons.“I don’t allow students to sit in the same seat twice,” Hanks said. “I know some students don’t like that, but I teach entrepreneurship, and to be successful at being an entrepreneur or being any kind of leader you have to get comfortable being uncomfortable.”Sometimes he ties the seating into theme, such as “ladies’ day,” when the lecture relates to female entrepreneurs. Hank said that he requires men to stay in the back or stand, while women sit up front.“I am establishing the culture of the classroom by doing this. We are going to have a culture where we are innovative and creative and going to get to know each other,” Hank said. “And, if that scares you, that’s awesome, because you are going to leave a little bit less scared next time you are in a situation like this.”Other professors, such as David Sutherland, an innovation management lecturer in the Terry College of Business, find that seating is an essential part of experiential learning — or learning that involves doing things and not just listening to professors lecture.


 


“For me, it is important to have flexibility in a classroom space, because I do try to mix it up with activities. I like to have different kinds of spaces for gatherings and for group work,” Sutherland said. “In my class on innovation, we talk about the need for connectedness and the need to mix it up, so, by changing classroom seats, you are not always talking to the same people.”Prevatte, who is a student in Sutherland’s graduate innovation management class, said she enjoys the engagement provided by his experiential seating arrangement.“I really like sitting at round tables because you can sit in groups, and the professor can walk around more easily than going up rows or having a platform to stand on,” she said.Sutherland said the majority of classrooms are typically built in the same way, with the same pattern of seating or room structure, so constantly switching up the feel of the room is difficult.“Today, we are designing teaching spaces at the University of Georgia that are for the last century, not the next,"" he said. ""When we have the kind of tiered case classrooms that we have, we are locked into that space, and it doesn’t give you that flexibility to create an experiential learning environment. So, if experimental learning is what we are going after, we need the kinds of classrooms that will promote that.”",Lindsey Conway @LindseyVConway,uganews,https://www.redandblack.com/uganews/students-professors-put-thought-into-classroom-seat-selections/article_8b0e9f3a-99ee-11e4-a3ca-b3262397add8.html
13-Jan-15,Gym Dogs' rankings remain at No. 7 after season-opening loss to Michigan,"After scoring a 195.600 in the season-opener against Michigan Saturday afternoon, the Gym Dogs remain in the No. 7 position in the country, according to the GymInfo rankings released Monday.The rankings, until Feb. 16, are determined by averaging the team’s scores up until that point. Starting Feb. 24, the system will switch to rank by regional qualifying score (RQS). To calculate RQS, first take the top three away scores. Then take the next three highest scores — home or away. Finally, drop the highest score of the six and average the remaining five.Defending co-national champion Oklahoma took over the top spot in the rankings after posting a 197.625 in its home opener against Arkansas. LSU notched the second-highest score of the weekend (197.125) followed by Florida (196.925), Utah (196.900), Michigan (196.600) and Alabama (196.225). No. 8 Nebraska, No. 9 Illinois and No. 10 California round out the top 10.


 


On the four events, the Gym Dogs are ranked No. 10 on vault, No. 5 on bars, No. 7 on beam and are tied for No. 28 on floor. Oklahoma holds the top spot on beam and floor while Florida and LSU secured the highest ranking on vault and bars, respectively.Individual rankings were also released with six Georgia gymnasts ranked in the top 25. Junior Brandie Jay is tied for sixth on vault. Senior Chelsea Davis and sophomore Kiera Brown are tied with 10 other gymnasts for No. 10 on bars while junior Brittany Rogers sits in a tie for 23rd on the event. On beam, freshman Vivi Babalis and junior Mary Beth Box are tied for No. 18. Brown also comes tied at No. 24 on floor.While the first week of official rankings don’t mean much in the overall picture of the season, it’s important for a team to build on week one results and not experience large pendulum swings during the season.This Friday, the Gym Dogs will take on No. 25 Missouri at home in Stegeman Coliseum before packing up for another competition three days later at No. 17 Denver.",Elizabeth Grimsley,sports,https://www.redandblack.com/sports/gym-dogs-rankings-remain-at-no-after-season-opening-loss/article_8dc683f4-9b2f-11e4-a6b1-9ffb546f2e35.html
14-Jan-15,Golden Globes inspire social activism,"When I used to think about the Golden Globes, I only ever pictured beautiful celebrities in expensive clothes accepting shiny awards. This year, my perception changed. Tina Fey and Amy Poehler returned to host the show for the third time and altered the agenda of the event.The Golden Globes premiered amidst a time of international turmoil. Fey and Poehler set the precedent for the night when they called out Bill Cosby for making light of the rape allegations against him; they didn’t let him get away unscathed just because the night is typically about celebration and honor. They set the tone for the evening and made a clear statement: we cannot sugarcoat or ignore the tragedy surrounding us.Typically, winners utilize their acceptance speeches to laundry-list names of people whom they wish to thank. When John Legend and Common took the stage to accept the Golden Globe for Best Original Song, they used their speech as a platform for social change.


 


Common urged his audience to see the humanity that lies inside all people in all walks of life. He showed his compassion and capacity for understanding by stating “I am the unarmed black kid who maybe needed a hand, but instead was given a bullet. I am the two fallen police officers murdered in the line of duty.” By focusing on the commonality of humanity, he unearthed an inspiring thread of unity.The President of the Hollywood Foreign Press, Theo Kingma, also championed social change. He received a standing ovation for his assertion that “together we will stand united against anyone who would repress free speech anywhere from North Korea to Paris”.He was not the only one to tackle the issues involving North Korea and Paris.  Comedian Margaret Cho, portraying a North Korean militant at the show, responded to her critics in a tweet : “I’m of mixed North/South Korean descent—you imprison, starve and brainwash my people you get made fun of by me.” She refused to have her sense of humor taken away by the fear of reprisal.Jared Leto was decidedly less confrontational than others, but his message was just as clear. While presenting the award for Best supporting Actress, he simply said “our thoughts, our prayers, our thoughts are with you…je suis Charlie."" This uncomplicated and transparent support for international relations transcended the shallow nature of award shows.Award shows are no longer solely about gaping over a famous actress wearing a dress so expensive it could easily support a small country. The people who attend are known more for their acting and less for their activism, but the 2015 Golden Globes changed all of that.Considering the broad viewership award shows receive, the stars have to take a stand and urge viewers to make a change. We cannot pretend all the corruption and sadness goes away for a few hours while the celebrities accept trophies. The 72nd Golden Globes has changed the face of activism for the better by focusing of the unification of humanity.— Hannah Gray is a sophomore from Roswell majoring in magazine journalism and English

Following the deaths of Michael Brown and Eric Garner, tensions between the police force and the public remain high throughout the country. Following the indictment of two police officers, the U.S. government has attempted to recognize the issue at hand. At the annual White House Tribal Nations Conference in Washington, President Obama called the situation “an American problem.""  According to CBS News, New York City mayor Bill de Blasio called it a “terrible tragedy” and later told his biracial son, Dante, to be wary of the dangers of cops. He stated he trained his son “how to take special care in any encounter he has with the police officers who are there to protect him.”


 


The NYPD took great offense from the mayor’s comments.  After the murders of NYPD officers Rafael Ramos and Wenjian Liu, their fellow officers exploited their deaths as a manner of protest against De Blasio. After a demonstration in which the officers literally turned their backs on the mayor at Ramos' funeral, Police Commissioner Bill Bratton deemed the act inappropriate and urged for it to go unrepeated, according to the New York Post. Unfortunately, his urgings went unheeded, and a similar demonstration occurred at Liu’s funeral, where the mayor eulogized.While the officers have a right to be upset, their ways of expressing it are entirely contemptuous, discourteous and flippant. The issue I take away from their demonstrations is this: these officers made their fallen comrades’ funerals about themselves and their issues with the mayor.The funerals should have not gotten attention because of the cop’s disrespect; they should have gotten attention because of the men they were held for. The two officers who died were let down by their friends and co-workers.Selfish is the only way to describe the officers who turned their backs on their mayor. A funeral is not a medium for a message or a statement. Because of the officer’s antics, the two dead officers’ funerals will be remembered as nothing more than an accessory to the mayhem.According to the New York Post, the officers “did it respectfully, in the street, not inside the funeral home, and not during the service”. To this I say any protest in the vicinity of any funeral cannot be validated or excused; there is no appropriate way to picket at a funeral. The officers should be ashamed of their exploitation of a funeral as a vehicle of disrespect. — Hannah Gray is a sophomore from Roswell majoring in magazine journalism and English",Hannah Gray,views,https://www.redandblack.com/views/nypd-retaliates-in-a-childish-inappropriate-manner/article_c9a1227a-9a8b-11e4-b114-2fe22dc07748.html
15-Jan-15,Use or Abuse: Researchers study drug monitoring programs,"A team of researchers in the University of Georgia’s School of Public and International Affairs are evaluating whether prescription drug monitoring programs prevent patients from obtaining the medicine they need.In 2012, a law authorizing the Georgia Drugs and Narcotics Agency to establish a Prescription Drug Monitoring Program was passed. A PDMP is a state central database where pharmacies submit information about the types and quantities of drugs prescribed to patients as well as the identification of the doctor who prescribed the drug.“The purpose of the program is to keep the drugs out of the hands of the people who are taking them for abusive reasons,” said Courtney Yarbrough, one of the study’s researchers. “Going forward, doctors, nurses and pharmacists can consult these registries to see if a person is doctor shopping, or going to multiple doctors to get multiple prescriptions, and try to find out if they are abusing the prescription.”


 


The first PDMP was created in New York in 1918, and the monitoring program has spread to almost every state over the past two decades.“This increase in Prescription Drug Monitoring Programs coincides with the rise in prescription painkiller abuse as an epidemic,” said Yarbrough, second-year Ph.D. student in the Department of Public Administration and Policy. “People don’t realize that it kills more people than cocaine and heroin combined. It’s a really serious problem that is hard to address because these are drugs that millions of people take for very legitimate and necessary reasons.”According to the Center for Lawful Access and Abuse Deterrence, studies have found that between 4.1 percent and 10.8 percent of college students reported using prescription stimulants for nonmedical purposes in 2011.“Although prescription drug abuse is not more prevalent at the University of Georgia than at other schools, it is definitely prevalent in the adolescent generation,” said Jason Callis, program manager for the Collegiate Recovery Community. “The majority of the students that the Collegiate Recovery Community works with have had experience with prescription drug abuse in some way, shape or form.”In the case of students who have problems with addiction to prescription medications, UGA provides a variety of support outlets for sobriety and recovery.The University Health Center provides programs such as the Collegiate Recovery Community that extend support and networking services to students who need it while in recovery from substance abuse, Callis said.“The basic ideas of the CRC is to support students while they are here at school, so they can achieve their goal of earning a degree as they stay sober and in recovery,” said Brad Upchurch, University Health Center pharmacy manager.This increasing amount of abuse is why PDMPs exist, Yarbrough said. However, the monitoring programs may present a challenge to people who need prescription pain medications for managing chronic pain.


 


“Before research, some of the reasons we might think there is an impact is that the PDMPs make it more difficult to obtain the drugs and more difficult for doctors to prescribe them. I think that the PDMPs may have a result in causing stigmas with the drugs, so that doctors and patients may not want to use them even if they are needed,” Yarbrough said. “However, it is too early to know for sure the impact of PDMPs.”Although PDMPs might make prescribing pain medications more difficult, Upchurch said he believes most physicians are astute enough to be able to tell when someone really needs the medication.“Part of being a good, thorough clinician is to make sure that you are using all of your diagnostic tools, and, if you see if patient is suffering from condition where there is pain associated, you treat the pain,” he said. “I think most clinicians will be able to make that call and wouldn’t withhold medicine if they felt like people would need it.”",Lindsey Conway @LindseyVConway,uganews,https://www.redandblack.com/uganews/use-or-abuse-researchers-study-drug-monitoring-programs/article_a66d6230-9c54-11e4-b6a5-8baa4ffc2a5d.html
16-Jan-15,SGA Open Dialogue event covers campus inclusivity with focus on race,"Around three dozen students and another dozen administrators gathered Thursday night to discuss inclusivity at the University of Georgia as part of the Student Government Association's first Open Dialogue event of the semester.Terri Cunningham, a member of the student services board, and Senator Tifara Brown moderated the dialogue, which focused mostly on racial and minority issues, and opened the night with an activity called ""stand up, sit down"" in which individuals were asked to rise if a given statement applied to them.Less than half the student attendees stood in response to the first prompt, “I feel UGA is inclusive.”


 


Fantasia Williams, a senior management information systems major from Valdosta who attended the event on impulse, said creating a harmonious environment on campus is a responsibility of all students.“It is on the bulldog family to not just embrace each other at a football game but to feel comfortable everywhere with each other, even walking to class,” Williams said during the event.Other attendees shared personal anecdotes, from watching bottles thrown at a friend to reading offensive, racist comments posted on Yik Yak in response to a probate event.Issues regarding undocumented students and socioeconomic inclusivity were brought up, and SGA Senator Johnelle Simpson added conversation relating to the LGBTQ community and students with disabilities.Simpson said it was important that SGA sponsored such an event, because it has a responsibility to serve as a model to other groups on campus.“As SGA, we can foster inclusivity by making sure we are not just focusing on the majority. SGA this year doesn’t look this year like it did last year or the year before that or the year before that. We are making strides,” he said.While no one presented any tangible, immediate plans for fostering greater inclusivity, Brown said having administrators present is an important part of making a difference on campus.“They are the ones that make decisions when we are in class. Having them listen to our conversation lets them hear firsthand how we feel and see what can be changed,” she said.


 


Brown also said moments of disagreement were healthy during the nearly two hour discussion.“I am a realist. I don’t expect us to be holding hands in Tate and singing ‘We Are the World,’ but I am ready to hold people accountable for what they committed to [in regards to diversity] tonight, and if people walk away having heard different experiences, I am satisfied,” Williams said.At the end, Brown told attendees about the relaunch of the ""I, Too, am UGA"" project, which is partnering with the Russell Special Collections Library to record people’s stories and pictures.Williams said the event opened discussion on a variety of issues.“I really enjoyed this conversation, and I really liked the way it was formatted so we had the freedom to take the discussion where we wanted to,” she said.",Mollie Simon @mrsimon22,uganews,https://www.redandblack.com/uganews/sga-open-dialogue-event-covers-campus-inclusivity-with-focus-on/article_421a8858-9d35-11e4-9510-f79cb76ea666.html
20-Jan-15,"Coal boiler phase-out to have positive influence on UGA staff, resources and environment","Phasing out the coal boiler on the University of Georgia campus is another step in the school’s increasing efforts to become more environmentally friendly. With the shift from traditional coal burning as a means of generating steam, alternative fuels must be brought in and old workers redistributed.David Spradley, director of UGA’s energy services department, said he plans on doing just that.“The coal boiler is 50 years old, and it is becoming unreliable and needs to be replaced,"" Spradley said. ""We spent about a year or so evaluating whether we should generate some of our own electricity on campus. During this process we looked at a couple of options and right now we feel that our best option is to replace the coal boiler with what’s called an electrode boiler, which is powered by electricity.""


 


Tyler Faby, former Student Government Association director of sustainability initiatives, was the student representative on a committee that selected the engineering firm and what would replace the coal boiler.“I wasn’t given any voting rights, but I could voice my opinion and that of the student body, and what I was hearing people wanting. I combed through the proposals and voiced my opinion on where I would like to see the project go,” said Faby, a senior finance major from Milton.Faby said he was pleasantly surprised with the decision that was ultimately made. “An electrode boiler is pretty much the closest way that the University could retire the coal boiler with clean energy and energy efficiency because it is tied to the grid, which we’re expecting to become more green and more renewable over the course of its lifetime,” he said.Stradley said one of the main reasons energy services decided to use the electrode boiler is because it gives them a variety of fuels choices.“We always try to run the steam plant as efficiently as we can and that means buying fuel as efficiently as we can,"" Spradley said. ""When we had the coal-fired boiler, we had natural gas, we had fuel oil and we had coal, so we had three different fuels we could choose from. We knew we did not want to go back with coal, and the logistics did not work out for biomass with the steam plant being where it is, so electricity turned out to be the third fuel source that made sense for us.”The coal-fired boiler should be shut down this February or March, after the coldest part of the year comes to a close. Spradley said the electrode boiler will have a positive influence on safety, resources and the environment.“Operationally, things should get easier and a little safer,"" Spradley said. ""Boilers are inherently always dangerous if they’re not ran properly, and there is always safety built-ins because you’re burning large quantities of gas. With the electrode boiler you’re using large quantities of electricity, which obviously is deadly if it is not done correctly.”


 


However, Spradley said, compared to the coal-fired boiler, the new electrode boiler will be much less labor and maintenance intensive to operate and maintain.“We had to bring in rail cars of coal in, those rail cars had to be unloaded, we had someone on a tractor who had to move the coal around and get it to where it feeds into the boiler, and they have to do that 24 hours a day while the boiler is running,"" Spradley said. ""The coal-fired boiler has a lot of moving parts, which need a lot of maintenance and repair when the coal boiler is down. None of that has to be done with the electrode boiler.""It would seem like this would dramatically reduce a number of worker positions, but Spradley said he doesn’t anticipate anyone being laid off, as all of the operators and maintenance workers at the steam plant will be trained to operate the electrode boiler.“We have a number of open, unfilled positions as well,"" Spradley said. ""There is always the possibility the facilities management division might look to see if there is a need elsewhere for workers, as we have some maintenance people and operators with alternate skill sets that if they are not needed 100 percent at the steam plant, maybe they would be used somewhere else in some of our maintenance shops.""Shutting down the coal-fired boiler will eliminate tons of waste each year, Spradley said. Last year the steam plant generated 258 tons of sulfur dioxide, 257 tons of that which was generated by the coal boiler. The electrode boiler will generate zero emissions, like a computer or a television.“We’re going to eliminate 35 tons of particulate matter, and approximately 600 tons a year of ash,"" Spradley said. ""When you burn coal, you have ash that is left over, and currently that ash goes to a landfill. So that, along with the sulfur dioxide and the particulate matter, all of that will go away.” Before shutting down the boiler in March, however, a stockpile of 3,000 tons of coal must be burned, Spradley said.“We paid money for that fuel and we need to use it the best we can,” Spradley said.

Spradley said the boiler is 50 years old and basically worthless, but the surplus department might try to find someone to buy it, and if not it will be sold as scrap metal.“The building itself will remain to house the electrode boiler, and the tall smoke brick stack might remain for historic purposes, as it is potentially even older than the boiler,” Spradley said.Installing the new boiler will be a lengthy, expensive process. The electrode boiler is set to be a $4.5 million project and is scheduled to be completed in November of this year.Once paid off, however, the electrode boiler is estimated to save UGA $500,000 a year in fuel savings.“The money saved can be redirected into other energy-savings projects that we do on campus all the time,” Spradley said.“I just want to say congratulations,” Faby said. “The administration really stuck their neck out on this one and did a good job. Under president Morehead this project has really catapulted.”",Allie Dean @aedean8,uganews,https://www.redandblack.com/uganews/coal-boiler-phase-out-to-have-positive-influence-on-uga/article_29d45eba-a035-11e4-ab95-3396f0433a7f.html
20-Jan-15,"New mixed-use, luxury apartments to be constructed in the heart of downtown","In the fall of 2016, Landmark Properties, an Athens-based student housing company, plans to construct one of the biggest and most luxurious student housing complexes yet.“It’s going to be a mixed-use community consisting of roughly 928 student housing beds as well as about 80,000 square feet of commercial space, roughly half of which will be class A office space and the other half will be retail space,” said J. Wesley Rogers, CEO and president of Landmark Properties. “It’s going to be the largest and best-located off campus student housing project.”The new construction will include indoor basketball and racquetball courts as well as 24-hour study lounges and gaming pods in addition to a rooftop, two-tiered infinity pool and an overlooking fitness center. The swimming pool area will also have cabanas and a large Jumbotron television, Rogers said. The apartments will be located off of Oconee Street right across from North Campus.


 


“We also developed The Standard in Athens last year,” Rogers said. “But this will sort of be the next evolution of that property.”The Standard has very similar set up, with luxury-style apartments and mixed-use amenities such as a fitness center, media lounge, golf simulator and study rooms. It is also located in the downtown area on North Thomas Street.“It was the first class-A community in downtown Athens. It was a homerun for us and one of our most successful projects ever,” Roger said. ""But we were able to find a better location and a larger piece of land located closer to campus. We are going to build an even better project.”Although there has not been a significant increase in enrollment at the University of Georgia yet there has been a substantial amount student housing development, Rogers said, the majority of that development has not been constructed where students want it to be.“Most of the development in Athens is not where the students want to live based on our experience in the market place, and we have been in this market since 2003,” Rogers said. “We have seen that the students really want to be in downtown. That’s where they want to socialize and hang out. They want to be within walking distance of North Campus and the stadium. So, if you look at the student housing properties in and around downtown, all of them are 100 percent occupied.”Another luxury apartment complex similar to the existing Standard and the proposed project for 2016 is Athens Ridge apartments. Athens Ridge has received positive feedback from students living in the complex, said Adrienne Jaubert, Resident Relations Director for Athens Ridge.Athens Ridge's luxury amenities include a pool and hot tub, intramural fields and fire pit for resident use.


 


“We consider these amenities about a third of our attraction because we have incredible townhomes here and community involvement events as well,” Jaubert said.Olivia King, junior anthropology major from Decatur, said living in Athens Ridge is nice, though it has its drawbacks.“It’s crazy to think about how nice it is. The pool’s great and is a lot of fun. They have a really nice study area and business center,” she said. “There are some pitfalls though. The parking situation can be really tricky, especially because I live in a five-person house, and there are technically only four spots. Also, the townhome itself is so big, so sometimes you feel like you can’t fill all the wall space.”Ultimately, King said she is ready to change where she lives.“It’s been good, but I chose not to renew because they are raising their rates, and this is already on the upper end of what I wanted to pay,” she said. “I’m feeling ready to downsize a little bit.”In regards to the construction of another luxury apartment in downtown Athens, King said she felt student would initially be interested in living there but wasn’t sure about its future.“I don’t know how it is going to go because the housing downtown is very expensive. It is upward of over $600 to $800 a month in rent,” she said. “I think the housing market downtown is getting a little bit too saturated, and it’ll be interesting to see how well another luxury complex will go over in that area.”",Lindsey Conway @LindseyVConway,uganews,https://www.redandblack.com/uganews/new-mixed-use-luxury-apartments-to-be-constructed-in-the/article_97dd067a-a029-11e4-91c6-7fad6df5a7aa.html
20-Jan-15,Absence from anti-terrorism rally ruins U.S. reputation,"After no significant U.S. presence was reported at a French anti-terrorism rally, which 1.5 million attended, the U.S. was branded as ""anti-unity.""The question remains as to why the U.S. ambassador to France was the highest ranked U.S. official to attend the rally. Both President Obama and Vice President Biden were at their respective homes during the rally with no public schedule.White House officials state, “we stand four square behind France,” according to CNN, but the absence of President Obama makes this statement hard to believe.  The White House admits they made a mistake here, which I appreciate, but that does not make up for lack of U.S. representation in Paris. This absence makes us look as if we couldn't care less about other countries face extreme acts of terrorism.


 


Even if President Obama or Vice President Biden couldn’t attend the rally, Senator John Kerry, who was in India, could have attended, or Attorney General Eric Holder, who was in Paris for talk shows, could have made an appearance. The U.S. had ample options to be represented in the rally; there is no excuse.A trip to Paris was not impossible either. If attending the rally were really that important, we would have been there. I honestly find it embarrassing that numerous world leaders attended the rally, and my country, one of the most powerful in the world, did not.On another note, the lack of U.S. attendance threatens the chances for the Democratic Party in the 2016 election. Potential GOP candidates use the lack of White House representation as firepower stating, “How sad is it for 40 world leaders to walk the street and absent is the U.S.,” according to CNN. Republicans can easily use this situation to describe lack of responsibility on the Democrats part.The White House really messed up here, and there’s no going back now. I appreciate President Obama paying respects when he visited the French embassy, but it just was not enough. I certainly hope the White House plans ahead and makes a point to attend the next time an event like this occurs.— Hannah Hancock is a freshman from Fayetteville majoring in sports management",Hannah Hancock @lm_xc_and_ik_it,views,https://www.redandblack.com/views/absence-from-anti-terrorism-rally-ruins-u-s-reputation/article_06bf0f9a-a023-11e4-82bb-c7ac67296ac0.html
23-Jan-15,Gym Dogs looking to bounce back from Denver loss versus Kentucky,"Contrary to their name, the Gym Dogs refuse to act like dogs when they take on Kentucky on Saturday.“We can roll over, tuck our tails between our legs and just call it quits, or we can stand up and we can fight,” Georgia head coach Danna Durante said. “I don’t roll over. We don’t roll over. This staff doesn’t roll over. These athletes are not going to roll over, so there is no other option. They will stand up.”Coming off a loss to Denver on the road, No. 10 Georgia (1-2) looks to have a more assertive style of competition as it faces off against No. 14 Kentucky (2-1) at home.


 


Since Durante said she attributes last meet’s struggle to a sense of hesitancy exhibited by the team, Georgia’s coaches hope to solve this issue before the Gym Dogs compete.“They need to be aggressive and they need to attack,” Durante said. “They need to expect that they are going to hit, that they’re going to just do what they do in practice, and why that isn’t happening, I don’t know. That’s our job as a staff to get to the bottom of it and redirect.”Saturday’s meet will have a unique component in that it is Georgia’s annual Pink Meet that raises awareness for breast cancer. This adds an element of personal connection for some of the gymnasts and coaches.“Anytime we can support the community, give back to the community, and just bring celebration to those breast cancer survivors or cancer survivors,” Durante said. “Cancer, not necessarily breast cancer, but cancer runs pretty prevalent in my family, so it always hits home for me.”The Gym Dogs hold a 76-0-1 advantage over Kentucky, so in order to prevent the first loss in series history the team will need to improve its beam performance.Against Denver, three of the six competitors fell on the event, but the Gym Dogs do not connect the errors to a lack of physical preparedness.“We know we have our skills.” junior Mary Beth Box said. “It’s really getting in the right mindset and the right frame of mind, and just focusing on being in the moment and what you can control really and forgetting about the rest.”Freshman Natalie Vaculik thinks once the mental aspects of competing beam are conquered, the mistakes from last week can be rectified.


 


“Everyone just needs to be calm and trust in each other that they’re going to hit their routine, trust themselves that they’re going to hit their routine, and take it skill by skill,” Vaculik said. “Competition can get very exciting and overwhelming.”Georgia’s overall score could also be assisted in that junior Brittany Rogers might compete again after missing the last two meets. According to Durante, she is expected to return to the lineup on at least bars.The change in mentality sparked by the struggle last weekend is what the Gym Dogs will rely on as they strive for a better outcome against Kentucky.“They will get a chip on their shoulder,” Durante said. “They will decide they are going to be better, and we are going to come out better and be stronger, so we’ve got to do it as a unit. We’ve got to do it together, and that’s our goal today, tomorrow and certainly going into Saturday.”Gymnasts to watch:· Brandie Jay is currently tied at No. 9 in the national vault rankings and is averaging a 9.908 on the event this season. She competes a Yurchenko full and a half, which is Georgia’s hardest vault.· Jay, Chelsea Davis and Rachel Schick have each scored a 9.9 on bars this season.· Last weekend, Ashlyn Broussard scored 9.875s on vault against Denver and on beam against Missouri.

24-Jan-15,"Gym Dogs rally behind aggression, drive in Saturday's win over Kentucky (plus video)","The intention to raise awareness for the fight against breast cancer was made apparent by the unfamiliar color that flooded Stegeman Coliseum during the Gym Dogs’ annual Pink Meet.It is only fitting that Georgia’s victory over Kentucky was classified as another type of battle to be fought.“They weren’t just a bunch of pretty girls that didn’t know how to fight,” Georgia head coach Danna Durante said. “They were aggressive. They attacked what they were doing. They were willing to fight for every tenth.“


 


The battle was won in that No. 10 Georgia (2-2, 2-0 SEC) defeated No. 14 Kentucky (2-2, 0-2 SEC) 196.975-194.225 as the Gym Dogs scored season-high team totals on all four events.The difference in the team’s mentality was sparked by a change in Durante’s demeanor.“We were about to train and we were circling up and she was almost shaking,” junior Brittany Rogers said. “She was just so passionate about wanting this team to step up to the position that we’re capable of.”Bars was the Gym Dogs’ best event as each competitor scored above a 9.8 and the rotation was highlighted by Rogers’ career-high of a 9.975.Most teams are lucky to have a single Yurchenko full and a half in their lineup, but three of Georgia’s six gymnasts competed the difficult skill even though both have the same start value.“We have a really strong vault team, and we were excited to prove it,” junior Brandie Jay said.Both Jay and sophomore Ashlyn Broussard’s scored 9.9s on the event, and for Broussard, it was a personal best.The desire to make a statement was not seen only on vault. The entire competition served as a representation of the potential the team did not show in the first three meets.


 


“I think that just shows everyone that we’re still in this and we still have complete 100 percent confidence in everyone and all of our training,” Broussard said. “We can just keep going forward from here.”The biggest improvement of the night came on beam as the Gym Dogs scored almost two full points higher than they did at the previous meet.Freshman Natalie Vaculik earned a career-high with a 9.85.However, junior Sarah Persinger and Rogers each had instances that could have turned into major errors, but the theme of fighting prevailed and Georgia finished without any falls on the event.“We wanted that fight and as you saw, nobody fell off the beam and we all fought,” Rogers said. “Sarah and I could have easily fell off, but we were staying on that beam.”Broussard posted another personal best on floor and the meet was capped off by Jay’s 9.925 in the final event’s anchor position.While Georgia’s dominance was exhibited for the first time this year, the Gym Dogs had trusted in it all along.“Pretty much plain and simple, we said that if you don’t believe in this team 100 percent, then you don’t belong here,” Jay said. “And everybody at once said that we belong here because every single person believed in this.”


TNCMS.AdManager.render({region: 'fixed-big-ad-bottom-asset', slot: 1, fold: ""below""});


Of course, earning a season-high on every event is satisfying for the team, but Georgia isn’t finished yet.“There’s so much we still left out on the floor, and that’s what [coach] Phil [Ogletree] said at the end in the circle,” Durante said. “Can we still get better? Yes, no question. They all screamed, ‘Yes.’”<iframe width=""560"" height=""315"" src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/_zFuLtcqrCc?rel=0"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>",Emily Giambalvo,sports,https://www.redandblack.com/sports/gym-dogs-rally-behind-aggression-drive-in-saturday-s-win/article_309363c2-a431-11e4-951b-df39d0c3072d.html
26-Jan-15,Krispy Kreme and a cause: UGA Miracle hosts Doughnut Dare,"UGA Miracle will host its fourth annual Krispy Kreme Doughnut Dare on Feb. 1, where participants will run a five-kilometer race through the University’s campus to raise money for Children’s Healthcare of Atlanta.However, this event is not a usual 5K race.“How many times can you say in your life that you’ve run a 5K and ate 10 doughnuts in the middle?” said Mackenzie Ryals, marketing director for UGA Miracle.


 


The Krispy Kreme Doughnut Dare features three categories for participants to choose from – “Take the Dare,” “Leisure Runner” and “Morale.”Contestants who choose to “Take the Dare” are required to stop halfway through the course at Tate Plaza and eat 10 Krispy Kreme Original Glazed doughnuts before finishing the second half of the race.The event then becomes a contest to see who can hold down their doughnuts until the finish line at Stegeman Coliseum.“The worst part was stopping in the middle of it and then catching my breath and eating,” said Matthew Foley, a 2014 University graduate whom received first place in last year’s event. “Running after I had eaten all the doughnuts really wasn’t that bad – at least not as bad as I expected.”Each Original Glazed doughnut contains 190 calories according to the Krispy Kreme website. Every runner who chooses to “Take the Dare” will therefore consume nearly 2,000 calories.That number is the recommended number of calories an adult should consume for an entire day according to the USDA.The USDA also estimates 30 minutes of running will burn only 295 of those calories.“We obviously don’t want you to get sick, that’s not the purpose,” Ryals said. “Last year I only saw two people [get sick].”


 


For those who wish to run without the pressure of losing their 2,000-calorie snack, there is also the option to be a “Leisure Runner.”“Morale” encourage participants through cheering, music, waving banners, or whatever seems to best fit.The event idea came from North Carolina State University which started its “Krispy Kreme Challenge” in Dec. 2004 to benefit the North Carolina Children’s Hospital.The concept has since spread nationally to various other colleges as a race for charity.“The event itself is very unconventional,” Foley said. “But it brings in a lot of money for the [Children’s Healthcare of Atlanta] hospital and all of the money goes to a good cause, so I’m all for it.”This year’s event is projected to have 700 participants and raise over $10,000.It will also feature a few UGA Miracle families – families whose child is being treated or was treated at the Children’s Healthcare of Atlanta hospital.“When you go to the [Children’s Healthcare of Atlanta] hospital, a lot of these kids are in this environment that’s not necessarily fun,” Ryals said. “For us to do something like this is definitely putting a smile on their face, which is something that they need.""

27-Jan-15,Dogs off the leash: Matthew Stafford named Pro Bowl MVP in first appearance,"In football’s ultimate exhibition game, one former Bulldog shone bigger than any other of the sport’s stars.Detroit Lions quarterback and Georgia product Matthew Stafford was named the offensive most valuable player of the 2015 Pro Bowl, the NFL’s annual all-star game, after completing 15 of his 25 passes for 316 yards and two touchdowns with just one interception. Stafford and the rest of Team Irvin won the game by the close margin of 32-28.Stafford reaped the benefits of throwing to some of the NFL’s most talented playmakers on both his touchdowns, as his touchdowns were caught by Denver Bronco Emmanuel Sanders and New Orleans Saint Jimmy Graham. The two combined for 2293 yards and 19 touchdowns in 2014. Sanders and Graham weren’t Stafford’s only weapons, as he also had the honor of targeting both his Detroit Lions teammate Golden Tate and rookie phenom Odell Beckham Jr. of the New York Giants.


 


Stafford wasn’t the only Georgia product playing in the game. Two Cincinnati Bengals, wide receiver A.J. Green and defensive tackle Geno Atkins, were on the roster as well as Kansas City Chiefs outside linebacker Justin Houston. Green was targeted for three passes but none were completed and neither Atkins nor Houston broke onto the stat sheet.Erik Compton loses day three lead at HumanaFormer Georgia golfer Erik Compton held a lead after three days and was well on his way to winning his first career PGA Tour event.However, a poor day-four showing knocked Compton down the leaderboard and out of relevancy.After shooting a 2-under 70 on the final day of competition, Compton finished last weekend’s Humana Challenge tied for 10th at 19-under, three strokes behind event champion Bill Haas. Compton shot a 66, a 66 and a 67 on the first three days of the tournament. With his 10th-place finish, Compton earned $136,800 and 67 points toward the FedEx Cup standings.Compton was not the only Bulldog competing in the tournament. Harris English finished at 14-under and tied for 30th place while Chris Kirk tied for 56th at 11-under. Hudson Swafford, Kevin Kisner and Brendon Todd all missed the event’s cut line.Isner eliminated from Australian OpenThe United States’ highest-ranked male tennis player and Georgia product John Isner failed to advance to the round of 16 in the 2015 Australian Open after he was upset in straight sets by Gilles Muller.


 


Muller, a 31-year old Luxembourg native, was the No. 42 player in the world. He easily dispatched Isner by a score of 7-6, 7-6, 6-4.Had Isner won, he would have had to face the world’s No. 1 player Novak Djokovic. Djokovic silenced Muller in straight sets 6-4, 7-5, 7-5.",Nick Suss,sports,https://www.redandblack.com/sports/dogs-off-the-leash-matthew-stafford-named-pro-bowl-mvp/article_d465893c-a63c-11e4-9729-0f57dfaf7067.html
31-Jan-15,"Mind Brains impresses, shocks with self titled debut","For decades now, Athens has been considered a town with a thriving music scene. Throughout the length of this reputation, which started with bands like the B-52s, the sounds of the Classic City have been associated with the weird and the peculiar.Local act Mind Brains’ self-titled debut does not stray from this motif of eccentricity and may even push the envelope a little. The album, which was released via Orange Twin Records on Jan. 20, works hard to both frighten and impress the listener.Using the broadest of terms, “Mind Brains” can be described as a heavily experimental and psychedelic record, although this categorization can’t be said with much confidence.


 


On its Facebook page, Mind Brains describes its style as “Mind Brains! Yes? Happy! About!!!,” showing an intention to confuse fans as to what type of music they are really listening to. The record backs up this effort too, as its style is ambiguous and fluidly changes throughout.Songs change from dark and terrifying tracks like “Body Horror” and “The Era of the Late Heavy Bombardment,” to peaceful and melodic anthems such as “Happy Stomp” and “The Morning Before the Morning Before the Dawn.” Listening to the album in order is an emotional journey that may sometimes be difficult to complete.However, in listening to the lean 34-minute album in its entirety, the cleverness of Mind Brains’ low-fi take on psych-pop begins to emerge.Each song becomes easier to appreciate in comparisons to one of a completely different mood, and in this way, the album succeeds.It is on the tracks that really combine these extremes that give the greatest satisfaction, as they serve as a safe haven within the chaotic changes. Songs like “Whistle Tips” and “Bouncy Clocks” emerge as the album’s best numbers, showing the beautiful, true colors that Mind Brains has intentionally buried.Mind Brains will perform at Flicker Theatre & Bar on Jan. 31.","Dillon Thompson

1-Feb-15,UGA not included in first phase of private housing,"The University System of Georgia has big plans that could change the student housing market for nine universities across the state.And while the University of Georgia is not a part of phase one, if all goes well in the first phase, its on-campus student housing could be partnered up with private corporation Corvias Campus Living in the future.Charles Sutlive, USG’s vice chancellor for communications, said the purpose of private housing on campus is to make the price of housing more affordable to students.


 


“Quality, safe and affordable housing for students is our priority,” Sutlive said. “By engaging private sector expertise in operations and maintenance of facilities, the campuses are able to keep costs down and focus on their core mission of educating students.”For phase one, Sutlive said schools such as Georgia Regents University and Georgia State University were chosen because of their need for new student housing.He said the timeline of the project will begin construction May of this year and is expected to be finished by the beginning of the 2016 school year.This is not the first time the private sector has teamed up with public universities for housing purposes. Susan Jennings, vice president of corporate communications and marketing of EdR, a collegiate housing company, said EDR did a similar project for the University of Kentucky.“Of the first 600 beds in 2013, while we were also adding the 2,000 beds for 2014, we were 200 percent applied,” Jennings said. “Twice as many people applied to live there as there were spaces. Of the 3,000 spaces, 6,000 students applied. The older products that still remained on campus were not half of that.”Because the first phase of this housing, which opened in 2013, was for honors students in the honors program at Kentucky, Jennings said it attracted a higher level of students, as well as increasing applications of prospective students to the university.Jennings said it was so successful among students that they have five more projects in construction that should be open for the 2016 school year.Donnell Francis of Georgia Heights said though it would be competition for Georgia Heights and other off-campus student housing, he thinks it is a neat concept.


 


“It definitely allows for students to stay on campus and be in an apartment like setting as opposed to being in a dorm,” Francis said. “It just adds to the market. It is another competitor, but it is definitely a unique opportunity.”However, Georgia Sen. Mike Crane, does not think it would be fair to the private off-campus apartments. In Proposition 1 of the plan, it gives Corvias a tax exemption, but Crane voted against it when it showed up in the Georgia ballot.In fact, some students and faculty may have seen this last November on their ballots, which wanted to “allow property owned by the University System of Georgia and operated by providers of student housing and other facilities to remain exempt from taxation.”This has been one of the more controversial aspects of the proposal. However, the aspect of affordability seems to be more promising for students who are already burdened with the expensive cost of college and living.To keep it affordable for students, Sutlive said USG will control the price of rent so that it does not increase over three percent per year.Though UGA does not have to weigh the benefits and downsides of this plan any time soon, the idea of private housing for public universities has proven to be a unique, but controversial topic.Sutlive said he assures all Georgia college students that this would only affect them positively, though.“Students will continue to receive a high level of service,” Sutlive said. “The University System institutions will continue to perform the vast majority of student-facing services such as residence life, room assignments, rent collection and security.”

3-Feb-15,GMOA holds big plans for February,"February has just begun, and the Georgia Museum of Art has announced its events for the month, ranging from creator panel discussions to art lectures.The slate will kick off with the fifth annual Black History Month dinner on Feb. 17.“It is an excellent opportunity to meet people who are serious about visual art,” said Hillary Brown, director of communications at the Georgia Museum of Art.


 


The dinner is open to students and any members of the community and features gallery tours as well as a chance to interact with the community. This year’s honorees are Amaki and Natasha Trethewey and the event will feature a musical performance by Faith Carmichael.The GMOA will also be hosting a panel discussion with the Guerilla Girls, a feminist performance agitator group. They will be hosting a panel discussion on Feb. 13 as well as a teen workshop on Feb. 12, giving a chance for girls to explore the galleries and create their own work.“They will call attention to the lack of presence of female artists in major museums, and the current state of the art world,” Brown said.Neysa Page-Lieberman, curator of ""Not Ready to Make Nice: Guerrilla Girls in the Art world and Beyond"" and director and curator of the department of exhibitions, performance and student spaces at Columbia College Chicago, will lead the discussion with Frida Kahlo. Kahlo is a founding and current member of the Guerrilla Girls.On Feb. 20, the Winter Reception will highlight the winter slave exhibition by Piero Lerda, an Italian artist. His art features a collage element, which occasionally involves pizza boxes.Along with these events the museum is hosting, another interesting event is a gallery talk on Feb. 12, called “A Year on the Hill.” Dr. Asen Kirin, associate professor of art history and associate director at the Lamar Dodd School of Art, will speak on ""A Year on the Hill,"" a series of photographs created by Jim Fiscus with Chris Bilheimer.“The photos of nature have a lot of decay elements and are mounted on large plywood sheets and taken here in the woods of Athens around the area of ‘the Hill.’ We are also hoping that Jim will be able to join Dr. Kirin at the talk,” Brown said.The museum is hosting many new exhibitions as the spring approaches. The calendar will also be filled with student nights, gallery tours and talks, showcasing art in many forms.

3-Feb-15,Malfunction at substation results in power outage on campus,"A malfunctioning component of the University of Georgia’s power substation across from the Joe Frank Harris Commons resulted in a power outage in Creswell Hall, Bolton Dining Commons and the surrounding area Tuesday afternooon.David Spradley, director of energy services for the Facilities Management Division, said a device called a lightning arrester, which is designed to control excess electricity introduced by a lightning bolt, was destroyed, most likely during the recent storms.“The thing is not indestructible,” he said. “The thing was blown to pieces.”


 


Fred Remen, director of the operations and maintenance in the Division, said the delay between the destruction of the device and the power outage is similar to a failing car part.“The device gets worn down and is only barely holding on, and eventually the thing gives out,” Remen saidWhen the device did finally fail, Remen said, power on circuit four on the grid shut down, leaving Creswell Hall, Bolton Dining Commons, Mell Hall and Lipscomb Hall, among others, in the dark.The power outage lasted only about 30 minutes, before workers were able to redirect the current. Remen said the lightning arrester has already been replaced.Due to the outage, Bolton Dining Commons ran out of food and began turning away students who came in to eat. As a result, both Snelling Dining Hall and Oglethorpe Dining Commons saw a higher volume of customers during the afternoon hours.At the time of publication, Bolton was still recovering from the outage, and manager Art DiFrancesco was unable to comment.",Nate Harris @grtgbln,uganews,https://www.redandblack.com/uganews/malfunction-at-substation-results-in-power-outage-on-campus/article_aafdda90-abf0-11e4-a377-9fb12800ed93.html
4-Feb-15,Virtual reality program provides support for students with disabilities,"A virtual reality mentoring program is helping students with disabilities enter as stronger candidates into the fields of science, technology, engineering and mathematic studies.BreakThru, sponsored by the Georgia STEM Accessibility Alliance, is a joint project between researchers at the University of Georgia and the Georgia Institute of Technology to ease the transition for students with disabilities interested in STEM fields as they enter college.""This project is really trying to look at the transition of students with disabilities into higher education,"" said Noel Gregg, a professor in the College of Education and one of two principal investigators on the project. ""The focus of the project, while we are looking at how effective all the varieties of social media platforms from Second Life to texting are, is e-mentoring.""


 


Gregg said her her goal was to create a partnership between UGA, Georgia Tech and Georgia Perimeter College student mentors and students who have learning disabilities and are interested in STEM fields from Athens-Clarke, Green and Gwinnett county high schools. About 36 mentors are working approximately 10 students to provide support.""It was about providing students with access to their coursework and access to careers in STEM, because unfortunately the number of students with disabilities graduating in STEM majors is very far below what it should be and some of that is because of access problems and encouragement,"" Gregg said. ""I would say their persistence, self-determination and more positive outlook towards science and math were definitely outcomes.""What made the BreakThru program different from traditional mentoring programs was that mentoring was done online through a virtual reality program called Second Life, Gregg said. Second Life, much like the life simulation video game Sims, allowed students to create their own avatars and meet with mentors in virtual spaces like cafes or auditoriums.""One of the problems that I have seen over the years that students with disabilities have, particularly by the time they get to college, is that they have had to tell their story so many times and they sometimes just want to have their own identity without the disability label attached to it,"" she said. ""The avatar ability allows them to be whoever they wanted. They would not necessarily meet each other face to face and they would not know anything about the person except for what that person shared with them. That is the positive of having this sort of virtual environment.""Rosa Cromartie, senior chemistry, biochemistry and molecular biology major who participated in the BreakThru program, said it was helpful to spend time with her mentor in the virtual space.""I’m not really a gamer, but it was a nice experience because I got a chance to learn more and interact with different people, especially my mentor,"" she said. ""We would meet at least twice a month in the virtual classroom. In the Second Life world, we would do modules and go over how I did on them.""The program, Cromartie said, helped her prepare for the General Test for graduate school, work on developing time management skills and keep her motivated to pursue a STEM career.""It motivated me,"" she said. ""To be able to talk with peer and faculty mentors who are working in the same field to rely and give you advice, it definitely helped me.""


 


Student Government Association Vice President Jim Thompson has also been working to promote educational opportunities for students with disabilities.""This is all just exploratory research right now, we are just trying to introduce the concept to people at UGA, but the program we are looking at would be an inclusive, post-secondary education program that would allow students with cognitive disabilities the opportunity to come and live on campus like any other residential student and obtain a post-secondary degree,"" he said.These programs are growing with increasing frequency, Thompson said. According to Think College, a national organization developing and improving inclusive higher education options for students with intellectual disabilities, institutions across the country are implementing inclusive education programs for students with cognitive disabilities including neighboring schools such as the Georgia Institute of Technology, Kennesaw State University and Clemson University.""We all came to UGA for the unique qualities this campus has to offer, and we want to make sure that students with cognitive disabilities have the option to come here if they want to,"" Thompson said.Although he believes inclusive education programs should be the focus of disability programs at UGA, Thompson said virtual reality programs would be a useful tool for disability education.""I would never want virtual reality to serve as the compromise to an integrated programs existence on campus,"" he said. ""But I definitely think it is a good supplementary tool. It could help with cognitive or physical disabilities as there are many factors that would impact a students ability to attend a class.""A virtual reality program like BreakThru, designed to be a extra tool for mentoring outside the traditional classroom or online learning programs, provides students with disabilites a choice, Gregg said.""If they want to be face-to-face or if they want to be online, they have that choice,"" she said. ""The BreakThru program provides them access and choices.""

6-Feb-15,Female comics defy old norms,"In comedy, there is one universal truth: funny is funny. For female comics, the truth is a bit more complicated, and professional acceptance can come slowly.However, as comedic actresses usch as Amy Poehler and Tina Fey challenge norms and shows such as “Broad City” find success, change can be seen in comedy.“There are definitely some people, usually guys, out there who will bend over backwards trying to convince anyone listening that men are just innately funnier than women because [of] cavemen hunter-gatherers hunting wooly mammoths [or] something else that has nothing to do with comedy,” local comic Caroline Schmitt said. “Those people, usually guys, should relax and watch some ‘Parks and Rec’ like the rest of us.”


 


Schmitt feels that personal experience, not gender difference, should be the focus of comedy. Schmitt said a good rule of thumb is that “any experience unique to a given woman is going to be funniest coming from her, and the same for a given man.”In comedy around Athens, the overindulgence of certain topics is a problem, especially when it comes to new talent.“You’ll see a man joke about date-raping women or do jokes that hint at pedophilia or some other disgusting aggressive practice. Once they realize no one is laughing, especially the female host of the show, they stop.” said Sahima Godkhindi, a second year and host of her own show, “Wallflowers Comedy.”Female comics often find social standards working their way into comedy.“No matter what you do, you’re still viewed as a woman. There’s a constantpressure to look good, act appropriately and be a woman all while trying to execute the perfect d*** joke,” said Elizabeth Capers, a third year member of Improv Athens and Lady Parts.During a comedy show, the first laughs heard from women are often whenever a female comic takes the stage.“Women write jokes that can make everyone laugh, and they can also write jokes that make women laugh. Not too many female audience members are going to relate to jokes that start off, ‘So a bunch of my bros and I were being misogynistic at Toppers the other day,’” Godkhindi said.As all sorts of comics take the stage, acceptance is growing in comedy.


 


“Marginalized groups have taken comedy out of the hands of a few guys to women, people of color, the LGBTQA community and the best part is that comedy is so universal that you can see these trends emerging all over the world,” Godkhindi said.","Maria Lewczyk

6-Feb-15,Lady Dogs fall to No. 1 South Carolina on abysmal shooting night,"The No. 22 Lady Dogs (17-6, 5-5 SEC) lost on their home court 58-35 Thursday to the No. 1 South Carolina Gamecocks (22-0, 10-0). While there is some pride in holding South Carolina to its second-lowest total of the season, not much else positive can be taken out of the game for Georgia.“If you don’t screen, you don’t cut, you don’t pass, if you’re timing is off, you’re not going to score a lot of points against a good basketball team,” Georgia head coach Andy Landers said.On a night when Georgia managed to only cash in on 21 percent of its field goals, freshman guard Haley Clark saw her opportunities increase.


 


“[Clark] was on the floor more than anybody on our team, was after every rebound, which is something that we stressed,” Landers said.Clark finished with eight points, four rebounds and more minutes than starting point guard junior Marjorie Butler. No player scored in double digits for Georgia.Freshman forward Mackenzie Engram joined Clark to lead the team in scoring with eight points. The fact that Engram tied for the team lead in scoring while shooting 3-of-15 from the field shows just how much of a struggle it was offensively for Georgia.“We got open looks,” Engram said. “We just didn’t knock them down.”Besides the poor offensive night, foul trouble also plagued Georgia throughout the game. Butler picked up two fouls early and finished the game with four. Junior Merritt Hempe finished with four fouls and sophomore forward Halle Washington fouled out of the game with five fouls.The only player on the roster who didn’t pick up a foul was junior guard Tiaria Griffin.“It seems like we are in foul trouble every game,” Griffin said, “so I don’t really know how we can get it under control.”As disappointing as the night was for Georgia, the team isn’t going to sulk over this game too long. South Carolina has been dominating teams all season. And although offense has been inconsistent for Georgia all season, the team is still optimistic it will find its rhythm.


 


“Once we settle down and execute offensive plays,” Griffin said, “we’ll be fine.”Georgia’s struggles may have been attributed to its lack of offensive weapons. The team is still finding an offensive identity after the loss of junior guard Shacobia Barbee to a season-ending injury. Senior guard Erika Ford, Barbee’s replacement in the starting lineup, failed to score a single point in 27 minutes on the court against South Carolina.In addition, senior starting forward Krista Donald was suspended before the game for a violation of team rules. This thrust Engram into the starting lineup and thinned out the bench even further.South Carolina came into the game beating Southeastern Conference teams by an average of 23 points, and that was exactly Georgia’s margin of defeat. While the loss signifies a giant missed opportunity, Landers said he will take this game to the film room and make a teaching moment out of it like he always does.“Hopefully we can learn a lesson from it,” Landers said.

8-Feb-15,"In the Headlines: Brian Williams goes off the air, Measles outbreak spreads","The Red & Black has been a leader of University of Georgia news since its founding in 1893, but a lot goes on in the world beyond the Arch. From South Carolina to Syria, here is a brief roundup of what international stories made headlines this week.1. Harper LeeUnpublished sequel: The author of the Pulitzer Prize-winning novel “To Kill a Mockingbird” announced Tuesday that she will publish a second book this summer. Lee wrote “Go Set a Watchman” — which focuses on Scout’s return to Maycomb, Alabama, as an adult — before publishing “To Kill a Mockingbird,” but her editor told her to revise the story from the point of view of Scout as a child. The publishing company Harper plans to release 2 million copies of the previously unknown book in July.


 


2. Brian WilliamsNews anchor recants story: The NBC journalist “temporarily” took himself off the air Saturday after apologizing for falsifying a story about his involvement in Iraq. On Thursday, Williams recanted his claim that he was on a helicopter that was shot down during the 2003 invasion of Iraq, saying rather that he was the following aircraft and the discrepancy was due to the “fog of memory.” The apology came after several veterans who were on the helicopter doubted Williams’ involvement in the crash, and many now question whether his nightly newscast will go on after NBC conducts a fact-checking investigation.3. MeaslesOutbreak spreads: Since the Disneyland outbreak of Measles in January, there have been 155 cases of the highly contagious disease in 16 different states, sparking debate about getting vaccinated in the U.S. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2014 was a record year for the Measles, with 644 cases reported in 27 states — the highest number since the disease was eliminated from the U.S. in 2000. Despite vocal anti-vaccine advocates who claim the prevention methods widely cause adverse health effects, health officials say the Measles vaccine is one of the safest out there.4. ISISAmerican taken hostage: The Islamic State and Iraq and Syria (ISIS) reported an American woman was killed Friday after Jordanian planes attacked a building in Syria where the extremist group was holding her captive. Although her death has not been confirmed, Mueller’s family members said their daughter has been held captive in Syria since 2013, where she was doing humanitarian work through Doctors Without Borders. Jordan joined the fight against ISIS Thursday after the militant group burned one of the nation’s pilots to death. 5. USC shootingProfessor dead: University of South Carolina professor Raja A. Fayad was shot and killed Thursday during an apparent murder-suicide. The shooting occurred on the fourth floor of the Arnold Public Health Research Center at USC’s Columbia, South Carolina, campus and —although the identity of the gunman has not been disclosed — the coroner said the two had “a history together.” Fayad, 45, was a graduate director and head of the division of applied physiology at USC’s Arnold School of Public Health.

12-Feb-15,Transfer linebacker Jake Ganus preparing to take advantage of his one opportunity to play SEC football,"After one week of climbing uphill both ways on Georgia’s campus, Jake Ganus arrived at one conclusion – he desperately needed a scooter.And, barring postseason play, he’ll spend nine months, two weeks and two days driving his scooter up a steep Lumpkin Street before taking a sharp left on Pinecrest Drive and arriving at Butts-Mehre Heritage Hall for the practice-and-interview routine.Then his eligibility runs out.


 


Luckily for Ganus, a football field is 100 yards of flat ground.“I’m not the biggest, strongest, fastest guy,” Ganus said. “You don’t really look at me on paper and you’re like ‘Whoa.’ You’re just kind of like ‘Oh, OK.’ But when I get out there on the field, I find a way to make a play.”Ganus spent his December fielding recruiting calls as the lone 20-year-old among high-schoolers touring colleges on official visits.“Stepping back and looking at it, it’s kind of like, that’s scary,” Ganus said. “OK, I need to be a little urgent. You can’t say ‘OK, next year.’ Or ‘OK, next week or tomorrow I’ll do extra weights.’”By now, most people familiar with Georgia’s signing day prospects know that he transferred to Georgia in the wake of University of Alabama at Birmingham’s football program shutting down. The learned fan or coach can recite his stats by heart.Ganus was UAB’s leading tackler his junior year with 70 and his sophomore year with 93, he had 11 tackles and a sack last season against Arkansas and he revived Chelsea High School’s football program, trying his hand at safety, linebacker, running back and quarterback.His dad, Greg Ganus, mentioned he received numerous offers after UAB’s program collapsed.Ganus is often interwoven into the “Who will replace the inside linebacking corps of Amarlo Herrera and Ramik Wilson?” shuffle, and is one of three inside linebackers in Georgia’s No. 10 recruiting class, according to 247Sports.


 


But it wasn’t always this way. Having moved to Alabama from Alpharetta before ninth grade, Ganus’ performance did not open doors to the next level of play. After bigger offers never came, Ganus accepted the first Division I scholarship he was offered by UAB, he said.Ganus' coach at Chelsea, Wade Waldrop, can still recite how putting the small-town legend Ganus at quarterback brought something good out of a 2-8 season, as Chelsea reached the playoffs the next two years.Waldrop also mentioned how Ganus has NFL aspirations and could potentially use this year at Georgia as a stepping stone.“I think being at Georgia, playing with that competition, getting that level of coaching, being around that level of athlete, it’s going to help him,” Waldrop said.After three years at UAB, Ganus found himself in the opposite end of the spectrum as college coaches sought him out. As his limelight suddenly extended past the borders of Chelsea, Alabama, population 11,277, Ganus was caught off-guard.“The weirdest part was, I actually felt like a lot of people wanted me,” Ganus says. “That was different. Because, like in high school, I was the one that called the coaches every day and was like ‘Hey, it’s Jake. Hey, did you watch my film?’ But this time, I had coaches flying in to see me at Birmingham.”A senior, but new to life as a Bulldog, Ganus has already adopted the weekday uniform of head-to-toe sweatpants and red and white Nike sneakers. He was explaining to The Red & Black that he registered for classes the Sunday night before the semester began on Monday when he was suddenly interrupted.Sports information director Leland Barrow peeked his head around the corner. Upon learning a photo session was impending, he quickly tossed a red Georgia polo shirt Ganus’ way.


TNCMS.AdManager.render({region: 'fixed-big-ad-bottom-asset', slot: 1, fold: ""below""});


“In case you want to change, here’s a 2X.”“Yeah, that’s fine.”Ganus spent three years building relationships and setting and meeting goals at UAB. Despite two losing seasons, the Blazers won six games last year. So, he’s not quite starting from the ground up.Waldrop may be Ganus’ biggest supporter, championing his former player’s work ethic, having seen it on a daily basis for four-straight years.“I would be willing to put my reputation on the line,” Waldrop said. “I would say that Jake Ganus is probably one of the hardest-working kids in all of college football.”Listed at 6-foot-2 and 225 pounds, although his dad will tell you he has put on weight and now weighs 229, Ganus began playing tackle football when he was about one-fourth that size.“I was the tiny kid,” Ganus said, smiling and raising his hard about a yard off the ground to indicate his height. “I’ve got a picture of me, and I was playing with the 7- and 8-year-olds, and as a 4-year-old I was the smallest kid out there. But I just loved it.”It wasn’t until Ganus had grown a few feet that his dad saw him having a legitimate future in the sport.

“When he as a sophomore in high school, he was an outside linebacker,” Greg Ganus said. “Starting quarterback went down, second string quarterback went down, so they looked at Jake. You know, he stood up so quick, that’s when I knew.”Now sticking to defense, Ganus’ favorite part of the game is third down.It’s rather telling of both his personality and predicament.“The crowd knows what third down is,” Ganus says. “And how you’re just one play away from getting off the field. Everyone gets on their feet, and I’m pumping my hands, you know, getting the crowd up, and it just gets so loud. I just get this feeling on third down.”Ganus pointed to his gut, like there’s a visceral reaction he experiences when thinking about performing well when it matters most.“I want the responsibility of the win or the loss,” Ganus said.Ganus will spend one year walking uphill both ways at Georgia.

15-Feb-15,Georgia baseball sweeps Eastern Illinois with 11-1 victory Sunday,"The Georgia pitching staff didn’t need many runs Sunday, but the offense drove in 11 anyway.Behind a six-run fifth-inning rally and a combined eight shutout innings by three Georgia pitchers, the Bulldogs (3-0) topped Eastern Illinois (0-3) 11-1 to complete the series sweep.“We took care of what we needed to take care of which is something we didn’t always do last year,” sophomore Stephen Wrenn said. “If you look at it, we had no errors all weekend, we made our routine plays, we got hits when we were supposed to get hits.”


 


The offense as a whole performed well for the third straight game, going 14-for-36 with five extra base hits. However, it was the nine-, one-, two- and three-hole hitters that did the most damage.Junior Nick King, who came into the game as the only Georgia player batting below .300 for the series, scored the game’s second run and started the fifth inning with a single and came around to score from first after he earned Wrenn a base hit on a perfectly executed hit-and-run. King finished the game 2-for-2 with two runs and a walk before being taken out in the seventh for a pinch hitter.“Nick King is very fun to play behind,” Wrenn said. “Throws the defense kind of in a spiral when they get bunted on and the pitcher’s running off the mound then he’s got to come back and throw me some strikes so it really helps me.”The following three batters — Wrenn, Skyler Weber and Mike Bell — combined to go 5-for-12 with five of the team’s nine RBI and four runs scored.“They’re the tone setters,” Georgia head coach Scott Stricklin said. “Stephen Wrenn did it leading off the game with a triple. Skyler Weber’s a very dynamic guy in that two-hole. He can run, he can bunt and has some power too. Michael Bell’s not your prototypical three-hole hitter because he can run and he can bunt.”While the top of the order was catalyzing the big inning, starting pitcher David Sosebee quietly waited his turn to get on the mound in the midst of a solid performance.“It is fun, but after a few [runs] you get kind of cold,” Sosebee said. “You get back out there, get a little antsy.”Sosebee finished the day after pitching six scoreless innings of three-hit baseball with five strikeouts and no walks.


 


“Command of the strike zone, a lot of strikes; he was able to mix in his breaking ball, throw his change up,” Stricklin said. “You feel a lot of confidence when he’s on the mound just because he commands everything that he does.”","Cody Pace

17-Feb-15,'Better Call Saul' demonstrates two sides of Saul Goodman,"A few years ago, the name Bob Odenkirk would have immediately been thrown into the broad category of “comedian.” Most famous for his '90s sketch show “Mr. Show With Bob and David” before riding “Breaking Bad” fame to the top, Odenkirk’s name can finally be placed confidently atop “drama"" pile.The actor was in top form as the titular character in last night’s episode of “Better Call Saul.” Playing the good guy and the bad guy, the desperate and the confident, Odenkirk lead the new series through yet another strong episode.The lead actor’s abilities were shown immediately in the form of a flashback scene in which he pathetically pleas to his brother after having committed some sort of crime. Once the episode shot back to the present though, we had the same old Saul Goodman back again.


 


For the second time in row, an episode was named after a Hispanic gangster who causes trouble for still not yet criminal lawyer Saul Goodman.Nacho, Tuco’s still scary but much saner partner in crime whose name lends itself to the episode’s title, is the main cause of Goodman’s problems this week. In continuation with last week’s plot, Goodman acts on Nacho’s proposal and tries to find the location of the county’s stolen 1.6 million dollars.However, quickly realizing what he’s done, Saul surprisingly begins to take on the role of a hero for the majority of the episode. As the show’s main character struggled to right his wrong before the gangster had him killed, it became easy to see how Goodman will quickly tire of doing the right thing.The notoriously shady character has been dipping his toes into the dark side just enough, temptingly easing audiences toward his moral decline, and it’s just so fun to watch.Seeing Goodman try to do right in two beautifully parallel pay phone scenes showed his remorse for what he had done, while making it easy to see how his transformation is beginning.One of the most important things that the episode showed us was the team up of Saul and Mike (played by Jonathon Banks) that “Breaking Bad” fans had been waiting for. Mike coming to Goodman’s aid at the end of the episode was the resolution to the three episode security guard buildup that we needed.Despite this important moment, the episode’s best scene was actually its last. As Saul drudged through the desert to the tune Elvis Presley’s “Find Out What’s Happening,” the series reached its artistic peak so far.The scene was gorgeous, and concluded with Goodman repeating the same line that he had so ironically greeted his brother with in the opening flashback. The episode faded out once again with a cliffhanger as the missing fortune fell slowly out of a duffle bag and onto the ground.

17-Feb-15,"Four Athens further develops coding classes, after school camp","With technology’s dominance in society, American culture demands technologically-literate individuals in all parts of the workforce.Four Athens, a technology incubator company supporting Athens startups, aims to help individuals become fluent with new technologies and competitive in the job market.The company has set its sights on educating the youth of the nation, specifically middle school students.


 


“The underlying issue is this is where so many jobs are going … software is really eating the world,” said Jim Flannery, project director of Four Athens. “If we can empower the citizens to learn to code, we can be much more competitive.”The company has begun to work with 10 students from Clarke Middle School to teach them the basics of coding.Students collaborate with a Four Athens instructor and a volunteer programming expert through lectures, worksheets and hands-on exercises to learn languages such as JavaScript, HTML5 and CSS.The program, known as Code Camp, takes place twice a week for eight weeks. The end goal is for these middle school students to code their own game of Pong.More importantly, Four Athens wants these students to become major contenders in the job market.“[Coding] is behind everything they do now … there’s so many opportunities for careers out there in that area,” said Shawn Hinger, media specialist at Clarke Middle School.Clarke Middle School is known for its technological presence. The school provides personal learning devices for all of its students, including laptops such as Chromebooks, which they carry between classes and can take home.The school owns a 3D printer, nearly 180 iPads, hosts coding classes during its extended learning time and hopes to form a robotics team. The school also owns Sphero robots, programmable balls which can be controlled by smartphones, and has participated in code.org’s Hour of Code, a national movement to expose students to computer science.


 


“I feel like every student should have an exposure to things like coding and all of the technology pieces that go into what creates the technology, at least to see if they’d be interested in it,” Hinger said.Code camps are soon to spread to other Athens-Clarke and Oconee county schools such as St. Joseph Catholic Parish School, Hilsman Middle School and Oconee County High School due to high demand for the program.While the University of Georgia will not host Four Athens’ code camps, the company does provide adult code classes similar to them.The 12-week class teaches participants how to use the open-source web framework Ruby on Rails, which is used by major websites such as Twitter, Groupon and Hulu.Flannery said one participant was hired to a job a few weeks after completing this course.“The ultimate goal for the adult classes is to really empower these students to know enough that they can get hired coming out of the program,” Flannery said.Four Athens’ programs support a larger discussion about the false perception of technology and coding as a skill only a select few people possess.Some consider this generation of UGA students lucky because they were born as digital natives, but others argue this generation should not be considered digital natives at all.


TNCMS.AdManager.render({region: 'fixed-big-ad-bottom-asset', slot: 1, fold: ""below""});


This argument is encompassed in a TED talk by Mitchel Resnick, developer of a programming language called Scratch, which Four Athens teaches in its kids coding class.Resnick compared learning technology to learning how to read and write a language. The argument is logical: children learn to read and write the English language the same way developers learn to read and write with technologies and coding languages.Anyone can do it, but it requires time and experience — so Resnick argues this generation understands how to read, but not write with new technologies.Individuals understand and interact — they read — with the user-side of technology each day by scrolling through Twitter feeds, matching three candies in Candy Crush or creating a PowerPoint presentation.However, some fail to see the developer-side of technology — how to write — because they believe the concept is difficult. When a friend posts on Twitter, what process does that post follow to reach your phone’s screen? What code in the game ""Pong"" causes the ball to know it is bouncing off your paddle?By overcoming the fear of coding as a complex skill and educating the public about the building blocks of what runs our technology, the possibilities are endless.“If we can start in the middle schools today, then in 10 years when these kids are graduating — and we’ve been teaching every year — I think you’ve got a huge population of highly educated people that can compete in the workforce,” Flannery said.","Joe Reisigl

17-Feb-15,University resumes regular schedule with caution,"As the weather warms up, Athens-Clarke County and the University of Georgia slowly return to their normal schedules following an overnight freeze that iced the roads and cut out power in multiple locations throughout the area.A winter weather advisory sent out by the Athens-Clarke County police department mentioned multiple power outages affecting traffic lights, asking drivers to treat the intersections without lights as four-way stops.One intersection without power is at South Milledge Avenue and West Rutherford Street, where a fallen tree branch snagged a power line, shorting out power to the street lights. While the tree limbs continue to lay there and power remains out at the intersections, crews have come by to set up temporary stop signs in order to keep the flow of traffic moving.


 


According to Holly Crawford, a Georgia Power media relations representative, the company reports about 5,100 customers in the Athens-Clarke County area without power. About 3,500 crew members have been out all night, focusing on the area hardest hit first, specifically northeast Georgia. Georgia Power’s sister company, Alabama Power, has also been called in to assist in the repairs.Crawford said overhead power lines are most vulnerable in winter weather, and the crews are putting a priority on them. The company does not have a prediction as to when all power will be restored.The weather advisory also noted several instances of trees and tree limbs blocking roadways, which Georgia DOT crews have been working to clear. And while no instances of black ice have been reported, police still ask drivers to remain cautious while driving and only drive if absolutely necessary. If it is not, police request people wait until the temperature rises before driving on the roads.The University of Georgia delayed classes until 10 a.m., and then later until 12:30 p.m. due to the weather. According to University police chief Jimmy Williamson, the decision to delay, made collectively by a number of top-level officials at the University, was for the safety of those commuting to the campus.“Based on conditions in this area and surrounding areas, we felt it was in the best interest of those who were having to commute into work or commute into classes,” he said.Williamson said police are not seeing any issues on campus. Roads and sidewalks are open, power is operating across the campus and there is very little tree damage. He said police are not seeing a higher number of services calls due to the fact that few people are out and about on campus.“The typical things we see on a normal business day, we’re not seeing them because no one has really come in to campus yet,” he said. “There’s just a handful of people coming in.”",Nate Harris @grtgbln,uganews,https://www.redandblack.com/uganews/university-resumes-regular-schedule-with-caution/article_ea19ac3a-b6c8-11e4-992f-a7db742850fa.html
18-Feb-15,5 classic R&B; and hip-hop albums you should listen to,"In honor of the recent iTunes sale on top and classic R&B and hip-hop albums that all but bankrupt myself and many of my fellow music lovers, I have put together a personal list of 5 albums in those genres you should listen to right now. So put “Uptown Funk” on pause for a moment and power up Spotify to listen to these tracks.1. “What’s Going On,” Marvin Gaye (1971)Considered by many to be Gaye’s master work, it is one of the most awarded R&B albums of all time. It addresses social and political concerns with a mixture of soul, R&B and rock that sounds as good today as it did 40 years ago. Unlike many seminal albums of a genre, “What’s Going On” has not lost its quality to the many imitations that have followed.


 


2. “The Anthology,” A Tribe Called Quest (1999)The definitive summary of 9 years of jazz-influenced hip-hop, “The Anthology” showcases the wit and expert meter of ATCQ. The group straddled the line between the innocent, goofy hip-hop of the ’80s and the dark and serious gangsta rap of the late ’90s and early 2000s. This is evident in their combination of lighter lyrics and deadly serious composition that still sounds good in the era of Kendrick Lamar and Kanye West.3. “Illmatic,” Nas (1994)One of the most highly acclaimed rap albums ever, this sets the bar for storytelling in music. Nas creates a provocative picture of life in the Queensbridge projects and accompanies it with the philosophizing of a true rags-to-riches story. Naturally, Nas executes this with peerless flow and production.4. “Voodoo,” D’Angelo (2000)A rich soul album inspired by the likes of Questlove, Common and Erykah Badu that takes its time playing with the deep grooves, shimmering horns and crackling basslines that swirl around D’Angelo’s voice. If you listen to one soul album, make it “Voodoo.”5. “Undun,” The Roots (2011)The concept behind this album is that a man named Redford tells us the story of his life in reverse order, beginning with a heart monitor flatlining and ending with his birth. The deep theme of tragedy is almost hidden behind music that combines the elements of hip-hop, soul, rock and classical. Lastly, this is considered by many to be the most underrated rap album of the 21st century.


 


These are personal favorites, albums that have no small level of critical acclaim as well as popular approval — enjoy.",Ian Woods,views,https://www.redandblack.com/views/classic-r-b-and-hip-hop-albums-you-should-listen/article_5bc9c72e-b724-11e4-90de-8be953f63f71.html
28-Feb-15,Junior pitcher Ryan Lawlor embracing bump down to No. 2 starter,"For some, the demotion from No. 1 starter to a No. 2 might cause a shake in confidence, a question in ability or even a decline in skill.As a player who has been both promoted and demoted between those roles, Ryan Lawlor isn't affected by the change.Last season, Georgia baseball’s Opening Day starter, Sean McLaughlin, fell early to injury causing the then-sophomore left-hander Lawlor to step up on Friday nights in Southeastern Conference play.


 


“Being in that position, it’s a huge role,” Lawlor said. “I wanted to be able to start the team off with a win.”The southpaw finished the season leading the Bulldogs in innings pitched with 81, starts with 14 and complete games with three. Lawlor also helped the 2014 Georgia squad to the Southeastern Conference tournament for the first time since 2012.As a transfer from Middle Georgia State College, Lawlor’s sophomore season marked his first as a Bulldog. He finished 4-6 on the year with a 4.22 earned run average.This season, Lawlor’s start was pushed to Saturdays to make way for sophomore Robert Tyler. In the fall, head coach Scott Stricklin sat down with his pitchers individually to inform them of their stake in the rotation.“We told Ryan we were planning on moving Robert to Friday,” Stricklin said. “He chuckled and said, ‘Well, of course,’ so he knew it.”Tyler entered the season ranked the No. 1 sophomore prospect by Perfect Game USA and was also placed on a watch list for USA Baseball Golden Spikes Award, given to the top amateur baseball player in the country.The switch turned Lawlor into the No. 2 starter on paper, but he has continued to impress early on this season.Lawlor has started 2015 with a 2-0 record, 2.25 ERA and 12 innings pitched. Lawlor's record and innings pitched were team highs through the first two series of the season and his ERA ranked second among Bulldogs.


 


The Savannah native recorded a career-high 10 strikeouts in Georgia’s victory over the No. 11 Florida State Seminoles on Feb. 21.“With another year under my belt, things are a little different,” Lawlor said. “I like it a little bit more just because I can scout the hitters.”Stricklin said Lawlor has been commanding his fastball well. Lawlor hasn’t been throwing a lot of breaking balls or change-ups. Instead, he has challenged hitters with fastballs and being aggressive in the strike zone. Stricklin said Lawlor’s consistency with fastball command is key.Lawlor has allowed just three runs, eight hits and three walks this season. His .195 opposing batting average rivals any Friday night pitcher in the league.With his strong outing against FSU, Lawlor earned himself an in-game interview on the first-ever SEC Network college baseball telecast. Aside from a few distractions, Lawlor was as smooth as he’s been on the mound this season.“It was pretty interesting,” Lawlor said. “But I started to get hit by fruit snacks and peanuts so that’s about the only thing that might have interrupted me a little bit, but other than that it went well.”","Sammy O'Brien

4-Mar-15,Georgia baseball defeats Georgia State 4-2,"A strong mid-week pitching performance from senior Jared Walsh aided the Georgia baseball team in its 4-2 victory over in-state rival Georgia State Wednesday night.Walsh went a career-high 6.1 innings, allowing no runs, five hits and one walk. He struck out four Panther batters in his first start of this season.The Bulldogs (8-4) defeated Georgia State (7-5) on a warm, 75-degree night at Foley Field for their second win of the week, after dropping three at Georgia Southern over the weekend.


 


“We just wanted to get back on a win-streak,” Walsh said. “Hopefully we can take care of business against Longwood this weekend and see what happens going into SEC play the next weekend.”The offense trickled in slowly after stranding four Bulldog runners throughout the first three innings. A pair of doubles gave Georgia a slim, one-run lead in the fourth inning, one from junior Zack Bowers and the other by sophomore Michael Bell.The three-run sixth inning helped to secure the win. Bowers led off the inning with his fourth home run of the season, second in the last two days. The offense continued to roll in the sixth with RBI from senior Brandon Stephens and sophomore Stephen Wrenn, increasing the Bulldog lead to 4-1.Junior Mike Mancuso entered in the seventh inning as relief for Walsh. He struck out the first batter he faced, gave up a solo home run to the next Panther batter and forced the final batter to fly out.Senior Zach Waters made his Georgia Bulldog debut in the eighth inning, tossing a perfect 1-2-3 inning. The East Tennessee State transfer returned for the ninth recording two outs before allowing an RBI triple. Senior Jared Check finished the game with a one-out save.“For [Waters] to do that in a pressure situation, to come in there and throw a bunch of strikes, is really encouraging,” Stricklin said. “It made everyone in the dugout feel about better about where we are.”The Bulldogs return to action this weekend as Georgia hosts Longwood at Foley Field Friday through Sunday.","Sammy O'Brien

6-Mar-15,"Defense lets Georgia baseball down, teams drops first game to Longwood 7-3","For the team ranked fourth nationally in fielding percentage, some key defensive mistakes in the sixth inning proved costly for the Georgia baseball team.Hosting Longwood, Georgia allowed all seven of Longwood’s runs to arrive in the top of the sixth with two outs and junior Ryan Lawlor on the mound. A high throw from shortstop Nick King, a passed ball and an error by second baseman Michael Bell led to Georgia’s eventual defeat.Georgia (8-5) fell to the Lancers (5-6) 7-3 on Friday night in the first game of a three-game weekend series. Ryan Lawlor (2-2) received the loss as Longwood’s senior starter Aaron Myers (2-2) earned the win with 7.1 innings pitched and 114 pitches thrown.


 


“They had life and we didn’t,” Georgia head coach Scott Stricklin said. “We got exactly what we deserved which was a loss on a Friday night on our home field.”Until the sixth inning, the game remained locked in a pitcher’s duel. Through five, Georgia recorded four hits, while the Lancers put up two.In the sixth inning, one of the best defenses in the nation made some crucial mistakes. Lawlor recorded the first two outs in order. He struggled to end the inning, though, by following with the outs with a walk and two singles.On a ground ball to shortstop that could have ended the inning, King threw a high toss to first, allowing the Lancer batter to reach safely, as well as putting Longwood on the scoreboard.After another single and a passed ball, the bases were once again loaded - still with two outs. A ground ball to Bell was fumbled and two more runners touched home plate. By the end of the inning, the Bulldogs had fallen into a seven-run hole.“We played with no spirit, no life,” Stricklin said. “The first six innings, we slept walked through it. It was painful to watch.”The Bulldog offense tried to muster a comeback towards the end of the game. Junior Daniel Nichols delivered a solo home run to deep right-center field in the seventh inning putting Georgia on the scoreboard. Junior Zack Bowers led off the eighth with a double, followed by three consecutive walks. The Bulldogs managed to cut the lead down, 7-3.Georgia finished the night with three runs as the Bulldog offense continued to struggle. The Bulldogs went 0-for-12 with runners in scoring position and stranded 11 runners on the bases.


 


“Bottom line is, we didn’t put any at-bats together,” Stricklin said. “They put the ball in play and when we put it in play we put it in the air.”The Bulldogs face Longwood Saturday, March 7 at Foley Field for game two of the weekend series. Junior pitcher Sean McLaughlin will receive the start as the regular weekend rotation remains depleted because Friday night starter Robert Tyler is out with an arm injury and Sunday starter David Sosebee is ill.","Sammy O'Brien

14-Mar-15,"LACSI receives $1.9 million grant to further education, public service","The Latin American and Caribbean Studies Institute, an on campus organization geared toward educational awareness and public service projects, recently received a grant from the U.S. Department of Education for $1.9 million.LACSI has opted to funnel $1 million of the grant money into two Foreign Language and Area Studies Fellowships: The Portuguese Flagship Program and the Quechua Language Program.Richard Gordon, the Institute’s director, said based on the size of the University of Georgia community, the resources available at the University, and the local Hispanic population in Athens, there should be a larger program to serve the UGA community.


 


“I’ve always noticed that there is a tremendous potential and interest for Latin American Studies,” Gordon said.LACSI is an on-campus organization which seeks to promote education and service projects related to the cultures and languages of central and South America, he said.“We need to understand our neighbors,” said Steven Lownes, LACSI’s assistant director, regarding the necessity for a greater awareness of the Latin American and Caribbean cultures.FLAS Fellowships are immersion programs where funds are distributed from the federal government to higher learning institutions across the country. The fellowships aim to equip students with the resources to pursue learning a language at a high level of proficiency. Participants in these programs receive money for tuition and a stipend to cover living expenses once abroad.At UGA, the Portuguese Flagship Program is a year-long program which offers students a chance to study in Brazil or Portugal for an entire year. Half of the year will be spent taking two classes at a university while the latter six months is spent doing an internship. The Quechua Language Program sends students to Peru, Ecuador or Peru.“Our goal is to create the most rigorous and efficient immersion program for our students,” Gordon said.With the increase in funding, LACSI projects that the enrollment into these program will increase and the tuition and living stipend will be higher, encouraging students to go on to pursue proficiency.“I think it’s great,” said Jonathan Dupre, a freshman economics and international business major from Griffin. Dupre, a member of the Portuguese Flagship Program, will travel to Brazil to participate in the program in January 2017.


 


“Portuguese is a great language to learn and any help to learn it would be great,” he said.Joey Stanley, a first-year Ph.D. student pursuing Linguistics, is in the second semester Quechua class offered at UGA. The FLAS Fellowship for Quechua is not yet as established as the one for Portuguese, but LACSI has begun to search for a native teacher of Quechua in an effort to strengthen its curricular presence at UGA.",Dietrich Fanz @redandblack,uganews,https://www.redandblack.com/uganews/lacsi-receives-million-grant-to-further-education-public-service/article_39202a84-c9fc-11e4-8699-4b86d4b3a1af.html
15-Mar-15,Poor pitching and unmotivated batting results in Georgia baseball being swept in conference opener,"Georgia baseball (12-8, 0-3 Southeastern Conference) was swept in the first weekend of SEC play by Missouri (15-4, 3-0) in less than ideal fashion.The Bulldog offense scrapped together five runs in three games, while Georgia pitching gave up 19 runs over the weekend.Georgia pitching, already a bit depleted without Friday night starter Robert Tyler, took another hit Sunday when junior David Sosebee left the game mid-batter in a 3-0 count after allowing a two-out, two-run double in the top of the third inning.


 


“He just didn’t feel right,” head coach Scott Stricklin said. “His legs locked up on him again and he started fidgeting in the third inning and we noticed it.”Sosebee was listed as ill and missed his last start. Stricklin said Sosebee wanted to stay in the game because he’s a competitive guy, but the staff noticed something was wrong so he was pulled.Georgia fell to the Tigers, 6-0, with Missouri’s starting pitcher Peter Fairbanks tossing seven shutout innings, giving up one hit and striking out six Bulldog batters.Senior redshirt pitcher Zach Waters entered to relieve Sosebee. The sidearm pitcher allowed three singles and three earned runs in 0.2 innings of work.The relief pitching settled in with redshirt senior Taylor Hicks going 2.2 shutout innings and senior Jared Walsh threw three innings giving up one unearned run.However, the Georgia offense never caught up with the strong performance from Fairbanks.“He out-competed us,” Stricklin said. “He had good stuff. He out competed our hitters just like just about everyone of their pitchers did to our hitters all weekend.”The Bulldogs play one mid-week game at Mercer on Tuesday before traveling to Knoxville, Tennessee, for a weekend series against the Volunteers.

18-Mar-15,"Georgia baseball gives up 16 runs, falls to Mercer","Shaky pitching and eight Bulldog pitchers combined for Georgia’s fourth straight loss.The Bulldogs (12-9) fell to the Mercer Bears (12-11) at Claude Smith Field Tuesday night. Mercer tacked on 11 runs throughout the first three innings and eventually went on to win 16-4 in the mid-week match-up.“Mercer was locked in all day long,” said head coach Scott Stricklin. “They made some great plays and turned three double plays, and we played very poorly.”


 


Freshman left-hander Ryan Avidano got the nod and gave up four in the first inning, all with two outs. Three of Mercer’s runs came off a Charlie Madden three-run home run. Avidano allowed two more runs before his night was done in the following inning. Avidano fell to 2-1 on the season and tossed 1.1 innings allowing four hits, six runs and a walk.In the second inning, sophomore Drew Moody entered for early relief and gave up five more runs. Moody pitched 0.2 innings with five hits, five runs and a walk.Freshman Bo Tucker and senior Taylor Hicks allowed a run each over the next few innings. Sophomore Austin Wallace and freshman Blake Hamilton followed with a pair of scoreless innings. Sophomore Connor Jones allowed three runs in the eighth inning and junior Mike Mancuso rounded out the eighth spot with a scoreless 0.2 innings pitched.Senior catcher Brandon Stephens (4-for-4, 3 RBI) provided most of the Bulldog offense. In the second inning, Stephens reached on a single and eventually scored because of a throwing error.In the ninth inning, with two outs and two on base, Stephens notched his second career home run, making the score 16-4, Mercer.“Our captains, Brandon Stephens and Jared Walsh, I’m proud of those two seniors,” Stricklin said. “They fought all game long in a tough situation.”Stephens and Walsh were the only two Bulldogs to play the game in its entirety.Georgia returns to conference play this weekend when the Bulldogs travel to Knoxville, Tenn. (9-8, 1-2) to begin a weekend series against the Volunteers, before facing Mercer again next Tuesday in Athens.


 


“The bottom line is you have to compete every time you play,” Stricklin said. “We’ve got some guys that are not playing with a lot of confidence. We’ve got two days of practice to get ready for Tennessee.”","Sammy O'Brien

22-Mar-15,Georgia baseball completes sweep of Tennessee,"Georgia (15-9, 3-3) produced enough offense to complete a sweep of the Tennessee Volunteers on Sunday.In a 10-4 victory, the Bulldogs combined for 10 hits, eight RBI and three double plays. Sophomore centerfielder and leadoff hitter Stephen Wrenn, who has reached base in every game this season, opened with his third home run of the year.In the second inning, junior first baseman Daniel Nichols hit another home run to give Georgia a 2-0 advantage. With a little help from two errors by Tennessee, Georgia scored four runs in the third inning, ending with a two-run single by Nichols to put Georgia up 6-0. Nichols hit 2-for-4 with three RBI.


 


Tennessee’s (9-11, 1-5) Nathaniel Maggio had an RBI in the fourth inning and an RBI double by Christin Stewart plated A.J. Simcox to make it 6-2 in the sixth. Then, in the seventh inning, Jared Walsh scored on a wild pitch to extend Georgia’s lead to 7-2. With two RBI by Wrenn and right fielder Skyler Weber and a solo home run by Walsh, Georgia added three more runs – Volunteer Andrew Lee added an RBI single.In 7.2 innings, pitcher Sean McLaughlin allowed seven hits and three earned runs, striking out two.""I'm really proud of the team in how they responded this weekend and followed up our Friday win with another Saturday and finished it off today,"" Georgia head coach Scott Stricklin said. ""It's funny after Sean [McLaughlin] came out there in the eighth, he came up to me and said that was the worst game he's ever pitched, but he was still able to get us to that point and the defense behind him played exceptional. I thought Daniel Nichols had a key at bat for us with the two-run single to get us a big lead. We battled and now we'll get ready for Mercer on Tuesday.”","Sarah K. Spencer

22-Mar-15,The best athlete at UGA bracket: Round 2 results and the semifinals unveiled,"The Best Athlete at UGA bracket has managed to do something a lot of enemy defenses couldn’t do in 2014: bring down Nick Chubb.With just four competitors remaining in the bracket, there are few things to be learned about the trends in the voting. First, versatility seems to be rewarded. Athletes who can do a lot are moving on while athletes who are specialists by and large have been eliminated. Secondly, let’s give it up for Georgia’s women’s track and field team. The upstart program has survived quite well in this bracket, but we’ll get more to that later. But finally, the last lesson to be learned before the semifinals begin is a complex one in the realm of experience versus ability.On the women’s side of the bracket, experience has been scoffed at, with a sophomore and a freshman squeaking their way into the Final Four. On the men’s side however, a senior and a junior made their way into the finals on the merits of overwhelming fan support.


 


So without further ado, let’s get on to the voting. As with last time, I will begin with the biggest blowout and work my way down to the closest matchup. Remember, the value next to “score” is a number between zero and one, the closer to one being better.Matchup: No. 2 Robert Tyler versus No. 3 Nicolas FinkWinner: FinkScore: .757This one wasn’t even close. The senior swimmer annihilated the top sophomore baseball prospect in America with more than 70 percent of the fan vote and 80 percent of the staff vote. One of the newest writers on staff, Cannon Lee, has moved on to the final men’s round while The Red & Black’s second-most experienced staff writer Cody Pace has been eliminated.Matchup: No. 6 Shacobia Barbee versus No. 7 Keturah OrjiWinner: OrjiScore: .587


 


From here, things get a lot more competitive. For one, Barbee, the women’s basketball star cut down before she had a chance to finish the season this year, won the staff vote, albeit by a slim margin. But the track and field community came out in waves to vote for Orji, who won an incredible 73 percent of the fan vote, the largest margin of victory in the second round. This marks the end of the run for staff favorite and opinions ace Justin “Hot Takes” Hubbard, who has now been eliminated twice in this bracket.Matchup: No. 1 Kendell Williams versus No. 4 Lauren HerringWinner: WilliamsScore: .555Though the bracket’s No. 1 overall seed did win both her fan vote and her staff vote, this one was still closer than that of the matchup between Orji and Barbee due to the relative toss-up nature of the pairing. Yes, Williams won the staff vote. But only by three votes. And yes, Williams won the fan vote. But only by two votes. Herring’s supporters and the tennis community at large showed out; there was only one person in the entire round to receive more votes than Herring. However, that one person was Williams, setting the stage for a heptathlon versus pentathlon showdown in the Final Four.Matchup: No. 1 Lee McCoy versus No. 4 Nick ChubbWinner: McCoyScore: .512


TNCMS.AdManager.render({region: 'fixed-big-ad-bottom-asset', slot: 1, fold: ""below""});


I’ll put this in perspective for you: The lowest score an athlete can earn and still be crowned champion in this bracket is .501. Georgia’s best golfer edged by the star of the football team by one of the slimmest margins imaginable. While Chubb did win the staff vote, the fan vote surprisingly came out in support of the Georgia golf team. That being said, had simply three more votes gone Chubb’s way, the tailback would have once again found the smallest hole and pushed the football team into a goal-to-go situation. However, apparently assistant sports editor Connor Riley’s Vin Diesel versus Liam Neeson argument was enough to sway support on his side. I, for one, can’t wait to see what action star Nic Fink is.","Nick Suss

27-Mar-15,'It Follows' charges into horror as an instant classic,"David Robert Mitchell made his sophomore debut with his new film “It Follows” after his release of “The Myth of the American Sleepover.” This film is a interesting look into sex and youth in an original, beautifully shot feature that is sure to leave your skin crawling.The film follows Jay, portrayed fantastically by Maika Monroe, as she is infected with a disease seemingly supernatural in its roots. The director executes every shot in this film perfectly, using wide-angle shots as a tool in creating this unnerving sense of chills as the 110 minute running time plays out.This is the first horror film released in years that has used anticipation on top of expecting the unexpected to leave you seriously uncomfortable throughout. Mitchell and Monroe didn’t do into it alone though, as it feels like every single person that worked on this film put their all into it. And it hasn’t been since “Drive” that there has been as powerful as a score as the one delivered by Disasterpeace in this film. 


 


Do not think this will be one of those films where you are going to see blood and guts splattered all over the screen. There is a psychological terror existing throughout the entire duration of the film created with the use of motifs, score and camera-work.Mitchell has just given horror fans and film fans alike an experience that draws on the classics, focuses on the contemporary and scares in a way that one wouldn’t think to be scary. Everything about this film was perfect when it comes to genre cinema.“It Follows” will stick with you for days as it’s smart dialogue and perfectly-choreographed 360 degree movements of the camera keep you questioning every little thing you see on the screen. I have watched horror films ever since I was young, and this one is easily going to go down as one of the best horror films ever made.David Robert Mitchell has proven that the contemporary horror film isn’t just about jump-scares, excessive gore and a bunch of ignorant teenagers. I cannot wait to see what else he has in store for the world of cinema.","Jorden Wade

29-Mar-15,"In The Headlines: Germanwings jetliner crashes, Indiana 'religious freedom' bill becomes law","The Red & Black has been a leader of University of Georgia news since its founding in 1893, but a lot goes on in the world beyond the Arch. From Germany to Indiana, here is a brief roundup of what international stories made headlines this week.1. GermanwingsPlane crash: A Germanwings jetliner carrying 150 people crashed Tuesday morning on a flight from Barcelona to Düsseldorf, Germany. Authorities said co-pilot Andreas Lubitz, 27, intentionally caused the crash while the commanding pilot was locked out of the cockpit. Lubitz set the autopilot to take the plane down to 96 feet, but it struck a mountainside in the French Alps before it got that low. The motive for Lubitz’ actions is still not completely certain, but reports have come out he had a mental illness he kept hidden from his employer; several doctors notes were found in his home, each declaring he was not fit to work. The incident is still under investigation.


 


2. Indiana law“Religious freedom” bill: Indiana Gov. Mike Pence signed the highly controversial Religious Freedom Restoration Act Thursday, making it law in Indiana and prompting criticism from around the country. The bill, according to Pence, is intended to protect the freedom of religion for people in all faiths in Indiana by prohibiting any government entity from “substantially burdening” a person’s religion unless there is a compelling government interest. While Pence argues the law is not intended to be discriminatory, the act has been criticized as a way to legally discriminate against the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender (LGBT) community. Indiana is now the 20th state in the country to have legalized a similar law.3. ObamacareAnniversary: The Affordable Care Act, known as Obamacare, celebrated its fifth anniversary Wednesday. The First Family at the White House celebrated the date. President Barack Obama credits Obamacare with saving money and ensuring approximately 16 million Americans. However, there is still a significant amount of criticism regarding the act, and the Democratic Party suffered losses at the midterm election.4. ExecutionThree executed in China: Three men were executed in China Tuesday for their role in a knifing attack at a train station last year that resulted in the deaths of 31 people and injured 141. Police shot four other assailants to death at the time of the attack. Three surviving men, Iskander Ehet, Turgun Tohtunyaz and Hasayn Muhammad are believed to be separatists from the western Xinjiang region, according to the Chinese government, and were sentenced to death in September. Patigul Tohti, a female assailant, is serving a life sentence. Members of the Muslim Uighur ethnic group, to which the assailants are believed to be a part, are arguing the attackers did not receive a fair trial and that the Chinese government is using the executions as a political statement.5. New York CityEast Village explosion: At least two people were still missing Friday in New York City following an explosion in the East Village on Thursday. The explosion quickly turned into a fire that ignited four buildings neighboring the original site. Police sifted through the rubble but have yet to find Nicholas Figueroa or Moises Ismael Locón Yak, 27, both presumed missing. The preliminary investigation determined the explosion appears to be related to gas. The owner of a sushi restaurant on the first level of the building reported the smell of gas to the building owner just 15 minutes after inspectors left the building — though they reportedly found no safety issues, they made recommendations. The building’s contractor was investigating the potential leak when the explosion occurred. Gas in the area has been shut off while the rubble continues to be cleared away.

29-Mar-15,Baseball takes first two games versus No. 7 South Carolina,"After needing 11 innings and 24 hours to take game one, Georgia opted to go just nine innings to sweep Saturday’s unusual double-header over No. 7 South Carolina.Originally scheduled for Friday afternoon, the first game had to be resumed on Saturday after heavy rain fell as the ninth inning of a tie game began. Georgia (18-10, 5-3 Southeastern Conference) had a steady stream of hits in the 6-5 win before the delay with eight but struggled in the first couple innings against the Gamecocks (18-9, 4-4 SEC) after play resumed. Small-ball ultimately won the game for the Bulldogs, after Trevor Kieboom’s sacrifice bunt put freshman Keegan McGovern in scoring position for Mike Bell to knock in with an RBI single.While it has been offense that has plagued Georgia at times this season, it was the pitching that made that game so close. First-game starter Jared Walsh walked nine batters, resulting in four runs in 5.2 innings despite allowing just four hits.


 


“We had 15 walks in the first game; I’ve never seen that and we still won,” Georgia head coach Scott Stricklin said.The pitching was much improved in the game two 4-3 win with junior Ryan Lawlor on the mound. Lawlor went four innings and allowed just one unearned run on five hits and also tallied five strikeouts.The Georgia offense gave Lawlor all the run support he needed early with two runs in each of the first two innings. Combined, the top four spots in the order — sophomore Stephen Wrenn, sophomore Skyler Weber, junior Zack Bowers and Walsh — combined for four of the team’s seven hits, three runs and three RBI.“Overall, it was a gutty performance by everybody, and we scratched a few runs across all day,” Stricklin said. “As a coach, you hope for a bigger cushion, but the guys came through in both games. I thought it was important to get an early lead in the second game and that took the crowd out of it.”The two victories mark the first time that the Bulldogs took a series from a top-10 team since 2006. Georgia will go for the sweep Sunday at 1:35 p.m.","Cody Pace

31-Mar-15,Breakdown: Summing up the Gym Dogs' chances in regionals,"The Georgia gymnastics team has a tough task waiting for it in Berkeley, California.For the first time this season, the opponents out on the competition floor and the outcome of the meet matter.Only the top two teams from each regional competition move on to the national championships two weeks later. So the Gym Dogs have to be on if they want to join the other 11 teams fighting for the trophy in Texas.


 


Like the Southeastern Conference championship, regionals will feature four judges on each event, so the scores will be tight. However, unlike the conference meet it won’t be on a podium, lessening the intimidation factor of competing four feet in the air.The meet will also be longer with six rotations instead of four. Because there are six teams competing, two byes — or rotations where the team sits and waits — are inserted to even things out. Byes can be hard on the team because it has to go cold for about 20 minutes before jumping immediately back into gymnastics.“We have to learn how to shut it off and then bring it right back on,” junior Brittany Rogers said. “Last year we did a lot of practice in the gym with that and it worked.”But these aren’t the things that will make the competition hard for Georgia. The other five teams will also face these challenges.It’s the other teams that could make things interesting.The Gym Dogs come in as the No. 2 seed, and Utah is top-ranked in the regional. Boise State is the three seed, followed by host California, Utah State and BYU.Just two weeks ago, the Gym Dogs faced off with Utah at home for senior night. Although the Utes came in the higher-ranked team, Georgia upset them and ended their bid for an undefeated season.“We’ve obviously shown them up before,” junior Mary Beth Box said. “I feel confident we can do it again.”


 


While Utah has the higher potential score if all gymnasts hit, it has faced a setback recently. At the Pacific-12 championship, the team lost standout senior Tory Wilson on the last event.Wilson ruptured her Achilles tendon and suffered a Lisfranc fracture in her other foot, according to Utah Gymnastics. Just three rotations before, Wilson scored a perfect 10 on vault and was on her way to potentially winning the all-around crown.The Gym Dogs have been two different teams in 2015. They have shown they can compete with the best of them when they beat Utah. However, they also showed some major weaknesses when they only managed a 194 at Denver in the early weeks of the season and fell apart on beam at SECs.If Georgia has another beam rotation like in Duluth, Georgia, there will be little chance of making its fifth-consecutive NCAA appearance. On the flip side, if the Gym Dogs hit like they’re capable of, they can go ahead and book their tickets to Texas.Both Boise State and Cal are potential upset threats.Boise State has yet to hit the 197 mark this season but has four scores close to the mark, two of which are away. The Broncos, coming off a Mountain Rim Gymnastics Championship conference win, also have a couple of stars on the squad in Ciera Perkins and Kelsey Morris.But the Broncos don’t have as big of an upset potential as another team competing.California is not only the host team but also has a higher home average in 2015 than both Georgia and Boise State have away averages.

Home not only brings comfort but a bit of a home-scoring advantage often seen in collegiate gymnastics. They’ll have the support of the crowd and no hotel rooms or unfamiliar surroundings or equipment to deal with.However, the Gym Dogs have a source of comfort themselves. Georgia head coach Danna Durante was head coach at Cal for a year before taking the job in Athens. So she’ll be able to inform the team about the intricacies of the arena.“It’s bright, the equipment is good; it’s juts a nice size,” Durante said. “The fans are right there, the energy is high; it’s just a great environment.”And the Bears continue to improve with the help of Pac-12 Freshman of the Year Toni-Ann Williams. Williams not only has two 10s on vault and two near-perfect 9.975s on floor, she is also a strong all-arounder with a season-high of 39.625. And not to mention she competed at the conference championships while having mini-seizures. Williams also has a high scoring potential on bars with a high of 9.95 in 2015.Cal as a whole, though, struggles on beam. In reality, the competition for all the teams will come down to who hits beam the best or even just who stays on throughout the entire lineup.But the Gym Dogs have a determination in them after the mishap at SECs. As far as they’re concerned, falling from the beam won’t happen again.So there are two scenarios. If the Gym Dogs hit it’ll be more of a battle between first and second and between third and fourth. If the Gym Dogs slip up and lose focus, it could be a battle for the last qualifying spot.","Elizabeth Grimsley

3-Apr-15,The Affordable Care Act: Five Years Later,"Last month marked the fifth year anniversary of the signing of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, also known as ObamaCare, which was ratified to give Americans access to affordable healthcare and reduce government healthcare spending. In 2010, 49.9 million Americans lacked health insurance, and 17 percent of the United States’ GDP was spent on healthcare.To see how the ACA has changed healthcare in the United States in the five years since, The Red & Black spoke with Phaedra Corso, a UGA Foundation Professor of Human Health, who said that though the numbers aren’t quite what legislators envisioned, the ACA is improving the affordability of American healthcare.Number of uninsured, amount spent on healthcare declined


 


Corso said that the number of people uninsured in the US and the amount spent on healthcare has likely declined since the ACA was enacted.“If the goal is to get more people insured in this country, then the ACA has been a good thing,” Corso said. “We have more ways for people to find affordable health care, which is the goal. But for states such as Georgia where we haven’t had the Medicaid expansion, its a little bit tougher.”Because Medicaid expansion, which is optional, did not occur in Georgia, Corso said there will be a smaller decrease in the amount of uninsured state residents compared to the rest of the US. For the states who chose to expand Medicaid, it now covers lower-income people without children.“Also, for the people who had previously existing conditions before and couldn’t find health coverage now can, and that’s good,” Corso said.But the number of uninsured is not the number we should be focusing on, said Corso.“The most important thing we should be asking is “Are health care costs going down because of the ACA?”I don’t know the answer to that, but there is some evidence that health care costs are not rising as fast as they were before,” Corso said.Young people benefited more than other groupsCorso said the ACA decreased the number of uninsured by changing who could be considered a dependent.


 


Under the law, children can stay on their parent’s health insurance plan until they are 26, whereas previous measures have limited the age to 19.A study by the National Bureau of Economic Research found that improvement in health since the ACA was enacted has been concentrated among college graduates. College graduates were more likely to have health insurance than non college graduates, as 88 percent of college graduates were covered, and 64 percent of non college graduates were covered.The study also suggested that in the age group of 23 to 25, individuals were more likely to have a primary health care provider and were less likely to not see a physician when sick because of the cost than before the ACA.Closer to universal healthcare, but not there yetMany argue that the ACA has not provided the universal system of healthcare that other countries have. But Corso said that the ACA was never designed to do that.“Its moving us in that direction because it's providing more options for people to get health insurance, but we still have a long way to go,” Corso said. “It was an incremental change to the current system we have.”The ACA provided a number of provisions to decrease the numbers of uninsured and the amount of money spent on healthcare, and more options was one of the provisions.“This provides for exchanges, state-based or federal-based, where people can go in and purchase health insurance in a marketplace,” Corso said. “Before the ACA, it might not have been easy for the average person to purchase health insurance. They could always go to a health insurance broker, but it was not an easy market to navigate. These exchanges are set up to be transparent, so that there is regulation so health insurance meets certain criteria, and the government also provides subsidies to poor people so that they can purchase health insurance on the market.”


TNCMS.AdManager.render({region: 'fixed-big-ad-bottom-asset', slot: 1, fold: ""below""});


What we have learnedPublic opinion of the ACA has been sharply divided from the beginning, but those numbers may be wavering as people become used to the idea and begin to see changes in the healthcare system.According to a recent Kaiser Family Foundation poll, the gap between favorable and unfavorable views of the ACA has become more narrow over the past two years — 41 percent of people say they have a favorable view of the ACA and 43 percent say they have an unfavorable view.Corso suspects that regular citizens have become used to the idea of the ACA, more so than they were when it first passed.“There are still a lot of people who are very unhappy with the ACA, and you see that with people who announce their candidacy for president, and for those who ran in 2014 elections, that people ran on platforms that they would do everything in their power to repeal the ACA,” Corso said. “I think there is still a lot of people who think it is doing harm rather than positive and want to get rid of it.”But Corso said there are other people who think the ACA has done exactly what it was supposed to do by providing access to many more people than before, and helped with rising healthcare costs.What comes nextWith the 2016 presidential elections looming, the healthcare situation in the U.S. seems even more precarious.

According to a Keiser Family Foundation poll, 74 percent of Republicans have an unfavorable opinion of the ACA, 65 percent of Democrats have a favorable opinion, and independents are divided with 37 favorable and 47 unfavorable.Congressmen that rejected the ACA from the beginning may get their chance to overhaul the healthcare system in America- but Corso said it will be difficult to fully overturn the ACA.“If the next president is a republican, I can see an overhaul being attempted,” Corso said. “If you have a democratic or republican majority in the house, senate, and the white house, it will potentially have an impact on the ACA. Let’s say there is a majority republican in all three, the question becomes if they will repeal the whole thing as is, or if they will just repeal pieces of it. Sometimes when you give benefits to people, its hard to take those away.”Alternative plans to the ACA don’t seem to be on the field just yet.“Immediately after the law was passed there some congressmen that proposed alternative plans, I know Paul Brown here in GA proposed an alternative plan at one point, but how serious those plans are I don’t know,” Corso said. “For the politicians who are saying they want to repeal the ACA, I haven’t seen any viable alternatives presented.”Corso said that because there is such a sharp divide in the US about politics that the ACA gets wrapped up in it, making it difficult to find a plan that the majority of Americans agree with.“Even if you’re an American that doesn’t agree with the ACA, I think it will be hard to find a viable alternative that has popular support,” Corso said.",Allie Dean @aedean8,uganews,https://www.redandblack.com/uganews/the-affordable-care-act-five-years-later/article_cd0fa36c-da07-11e4-85c4-0bc87f35f984.html
30-Apr-15,Todd Gurley to the Rams with No. 10 pick in the NFL Draft,"After waiting almost three years to hear a running back's name get called in the first round. Todd Gurley only had to wait 10 picks to here his name from Roger Goodell's mouth.Gurley, who is Georgia's second all-time leading rusher, is the first running back since David Wilson in the 2012 draft to be picked in the first round of the NFL Draft. Gurley finished his junior season with 911 yards and nine touchdowns in only six games. Gurley missed seven games, four due to a suspension from the NCAA due to Gurley selling his autograph and three more after he tore his ACL against Auburn. 


 


Gurley is the first Georgia running back to go in the first round since Knowshon Moreno was drafted 12th by the Denver Broncos in the 2009 NFL Draft. Gurley is also the highest drafted Bulldog since Matt Stafford was picked first overall in the 2009 draft.","Connor Riley

8-May-15,Georiga women's tennis team ready to win its third national championship,"Anxious players wait for their team’s seed to be announced. The anxiety is paired with a side order of wings and sweet treats. But, the real treat will be winning a third NCAA Championship title.The No. 6 Georgia women’s tennis team has held court all season, with a few minor blips along the way. The group of women, led by head coach Jeff Wallace, have been a mainstay in the top-10 rankings a majority of the season.Although ranking has nothing to do with winning championships necessarily, it is a testament to the team’s hard work. It is also evidence that this young team, boasting five freshmen, should have a valid chance at going far in the tournament.


 


“Looking at our tournament play as a team, we do really well,” sophomore Caroline Brinson said. “If you take our results at indoors and then the SEC Tournament, we got to the finals in both. Hopefully we get to the final of this one and win it.”The NCAAs are being held in Waco, Texas this year after regionals. Georgia penciled the Baylor Bears into its schedule at the beginning of the dual-match season in January. The match up was not originally planned, but head coach Jeff Wallace and assistant coach Drake Bernstein believed it was a good strategy for their team.“Starting the season there was awesome because we got a good vibe of the atmosphere out there and their fans,” Brinson said. “We saw that their fans are loud. I think it will be good that we are going back there, and we will be able to use that to our advantage.”In order to get back to Waco, the team will need to get through its first and second round matches which will be held in Athens May 9-10. The Bulldogs are hosting Charleston Southern Buccaneers in their first-round match May 9 at noon. The winner of the match will advance to play the winner of No. 23 Duke and No. 38 Purdue match May 10 at 1 p.m.“We’ve got a great regional here with three other awesome teams,” Wallace said. “That’s really where all of our focus is right now. All the top 16 teams right now don’t want to look past their round of 32, their first round match. You just have to zone in on that and take care of business. That is certainly what we are going to try to do.”On the other side of Georgia’s regional sits Michigan, Miami, Kentucky and DePaul. The Bulldogs are familiar with some of the teams they may face if they make it out the regional stage.“We played Michigan earlier in the year,” the lone senior Lauren Herring said. “We got to see Duke play a fair amount, although we didn’t play them ourselves. A lot of the girls we know. Also in our bracket, looking way down the road, is Cal, a team we played in indoors too.”Georgia beat Cal in the National Indoors this year. Another California team the Bulldogs could possibly run into is UCLA. The Bulldogs beat the defending NCAA champions earlier in the season, when they played in the National Indoors as well. The two teams would not meet up until the semifinal round, if each team holds court.


 


Georgia would have to go through Cal to make it to the semifinals and UCLA would have to go through the overall No. 2 seed in the tournament and first-ranked North Carolina Tar Heels. The Tar Heels roughed up the Bulldogs in the National Indoor final.Herring is confident in Georgia’s chances of going far in the tournament.“Because our conference is really tough, we are put in tough situations, and to be able to come out of those, even when you don’t come out of them on top, just being in those situations helps you a lot down the road,” Herring said. “We’ve been in two finals now. We are really confident. We are telling ourselves, third time is the charm. I think this is really our time right now for NCAAs.”In order to prepare for regionals, the team has put their training into overdrive. The last match the team played was in the Southeastern Conference tournament final, which they lost against Vanderbilt. The Georgia players are eager to get back to their winning ways.“We’ve just been working really hard on and off the court,” Brinson said. “We’ve done a lot of running and a lot of circuits in the weight room. On the court, we’ve been keeping our rhythm by playing sets, playing matches, and doing a lot of drills.”It is Herrings’ last run of doing drills, training and playing in the NCAA as a Bulldog. But that is not what she is thinking about as the tournament approaches.“Not yet,” Herring said. “I’m pretty focused on what needs to get done. But I do think realizing that it’s your last go, you have to leave it all out there. That is the mentality I’m going into the tournament with.”Other members on the team will be playing in the tournament for the first time—five to be exact. The returning players do not want to spoil the experience for the freshmen, or put too much pressure on them.

“We want them to stay relaxed,” Brinson said. “But the closer it gets, we will talk to them a little bit more about it. Telling them to play it like it’s every other match. Don’t play it like it’s done if you lose because that’s the truth, and you have to play with that in the back of your mind so it is motivation, but at the same time you’ve got to play loose.”The team’s mindset is half the battle, performance is the other half. But these Bulldogs know they can’t get ahead of themselves.“We know we are going to have to be ready for everything that comes our way,” Brinson said. “Looking forward at the rest of the draw, we are really excited. But I think we’ve got to take it one step at a time, and we are ready to do that.”","Charlette Hall

15-May-15,Location is key for Georgia's softball regional,"Off of Highway 10, onto Milledge Avenue and into Jack Turner Stadium, Georgia softball stands exactly where it wants to be.Hosting the NCAA Athens Regional in the first round of the playoffs, the No. 14 Georgia team welcomes the University of North Carolina, Central Connecticut State and Western Kentucky in a double elimination format, a set-up that has amplified Georgia’s workload in the past.“The plan is to not do what we did last year, and not play five games, because that is obviously a lot of extra work,” senior third baseman Anna Swafford said, “so the plan is to win three and treat it like it’s single elimination.”


 


This weekend marks the 14th time a Georgia squad will appear in the Regional and the eighth at home in Athens. With the ideal location of play in place, Swafford and her teammates will comfortably stick to their normal routine in Athens. And with school out, what else can they do but focus on softball?On offense, location once again resumes center stage. To ensure that runners move to the next base and utilize a field that encourages bad hops, the Georgia batters have fixated their attention soley to run production.“We’re really focusing on working the top half of the ball and focusing less on trying to hit homeruns and get under the ball. We really want to focus on being productive and executing and making sure we find a way to get our runs in, even if it means giving up our swing a little bit,” Swafford said.They’ll also use speed, which Swafford acknowledges as a major asset of the Georgia squad, even with listed power hitters. The quick pace on the bases will provide the runs the Bulldogs will need in what Swafford calls a “do-or-die” situation as the senior faces the end of the road in her Georgia softball career.On the other side of the pavement, sitting on a pitcher’s duel with Alabama in the SEC tournament the week before, freshman Brittany Gray continues to enhance her collegiate resume. She will add on an NCAA Regional after this weekend, but for now, her post-season record is clean.“I shouldn’t say [the post-season is] more relaxing, but it clears our minds,” Gray said, “and we really just focus on what’s coming, and not what’s happened.”With a shaking head, she remarks on the “crazy” feeling in regards to the high stages she has pitched on in the past year, but she resolutely states her clear objective for this weekend.“Location,” Gray said. “We’re making sure that we’re hitting our spots out there with coach [Rick] Pauley and just calming down and competing with each other and not against each other.”

15-May-15,Georgia wins opening game of NCAA Regional 6-1,"Georgia pitcher Chelsea Wilkinson had little trouble against Central Connecticut State in the Bulldogs’ first game of the Athens Regional. The junior starter pitched a solid seven-inning game that included 10 strikeouts and five allowed hits.All she needed was a little help from the Bulldogs’ offense to walk away victorious.Georgia second baseman Alex Hugo provided Wilkinson with what she desired with a solo home run in the top of the sixth inning. The hit sparked the offense in a five-run outburst and helped match Wilkinson’s gem in a 6-1 win over Central Connecticut State.


 


“I can't say enough about my defense,” Wilkinson said. “They were making plays left and right behind me. I was just out there throwing with confidence.”Hugo’s hit to open the sixth broke up a 1-1 affair and began a big inning for the Bulldogs. Georgia took full advantage of the shaken Blue Devils pitching staff and recorded eight hits in the inning. The hits helped four runs score and created a comfortable margin for the hosting squad.“We had a clutch offense and we took advantage of the short game,” Georgia head coach Lu Harris-Champer said. “I'm really proud of the team for fighting today.”The early innings saw very little offense from either side.Central Connecticut State’s Katie Schmidt picked an excellent time for her first collegiate home run. The junior second baseman launched one of Wilkinson’s few mistakes for a solo home run in the top of the third to put the Blue Devils ahead 1-0. Although the play put the Bulldogs in a hole, Wilkinson felt no need to panic in the situation.""She took advantage of my pitch and got a good hit,” Wilkinson said. “I just had to shake it off and make my next pitch good.”The Bulldogs responded with one run in the bottom of the inning. Hugo delivered for the first time in the game with a sacrifice fly to left field, allowing center fielder Niaja Griffin to tie the game 1-1.Hugo’s later hit served as another case of the junior second baseman delivering when Georgia desperately needed her. In this case, it helped the Bulldogs break out of the funk of a low-scoring game.


 


“I think it got everybody out of the tenseness,” Hugo said. “I think we really started to have fun then.”Georgia’s big inning ruined what was a solid outing from Central Connecticut State’s Laura Messina, who entered Friday with the most shutouts in the nation with 15. Messina left the game with her ninth loss of the season after surrendering six earned runs on 13 hits.Georgia’s win on Friday means a game versus Western Kentucky at noon on Saturday. The Hilltoppers enter the matchup with a 35-12 record and are fresh off a 2-1 win over North Carolina.","Jordan D. Hill

15-May-15,Georgia picks up a commitment from 2016 defensive lineman,"With spring high school football wrapping up across the state of Georgia, one prospect made an announcement on where he will be playing his college football.Tyler Clark of Americus announced Friday night, at the conclusion of his high school’s spring game, that he is committed to playing football at the University of Georgia.Clark is a four-star defensive tackle according to 247sports.com composite rankings, as well as the No. 20 overall prospect in the state. Clark is listed at 6-foot-3 and weighs 290 pounds. He is the second defensive lineman Georgia has gotten to commit to them for the 2016 class, joining Homerville defensive end Chauncey Manac.


 


Clark is the 11th commitment for the 2016 class, and is the eighth from the state of Georgia. He is the fourth player in the class who is slated to play defense, joining Manac and defensive backs Tyrique McGhee and Malek Young. Clark’s commitment ends a month long drought for the Bulldogs, as offensive tackle Chris Barnes committed to the Bulldogs on April 11.In the 2015 class, Georgia signed eight projected defensive linemen. However one of those projected linemen, Natrez Patrick, has already moved to inside linebacker. Patrick stood out this spring according to Georgia head coach Mark Richt.","Connor Riley

16-May-15,"Georgia falls to Western Kentucky, 2-1, in 14 innings","A single swing from the bat of Western Kentucky shortstop Brooke Holloway prompted an added seven innings and two hours to the Georgia vs. Western Kentucky softball game Saturday afternoon.That swing came during a head-to-head confrontation between pitchers Chelsea Wilkinson and Miranda Kramer in the Athens Regional. Kramer ended the day with 19 strikeouts and 192 pitches, with Wilkinson at a 15 with 195 pitches.Western Kentucky’s Hannah Parker broke the string of strikeouts in the bottom of the third with a single to right field, followed by a walk from Larissa Franklin and a trip to the mound from assistant coach Rick Pauley. But the two Western Kentucky runners remained stranded with another strikeout from Wilkinson and a popped up bunt.


 


The Bulldogs changed up the scoreless story in the fourth, with Sydni Emanuel reaching base on the first hit of the game, a double to left center. And with a single to left, Alex Hugo scored S. Emanuel for the Georgia lead. Wilkinson continued to produce strikeouts in the fourth, up to ten by the bottom of the inning.After six scoreless innings and a season tying 12 strikeouts for Wilkinson, junior Brooke Holloway’s home run tied the score at one and forced the game into extra innings.Despite a base-hit line drive off of pitcher Kramer in the eighth, Georgia lead-off batter Cortni Emanuel would reach no further than first, and Western Kentucky stepped up to the plate. Positioned on the warning track with a few inches to spare before the wall, S. Emanuel caught the second out as the Bulldogs just barely moved into the ninth.In the top of the inning, Hugo walked, setting up a sacrifice bunt from Tina Iosefa. But third baseman Preslie Cruce threw the ball to second, where a sliding Hugo forced the ball out of shortstop Holloway’s hands. But she was only safe for a moment, as Western Kentucky head coach Amy Tudor’s arguments prompted an umpire conference and reversed call. Amid Georgia head coach Lu Harris-Champer’s shaking head and visual objections, Hugo was forced into the dugout and back to her position at second base for the bottom of the ninth.There, she continued to put on a show, making the second two outs to extend the standoff. The defensive game concluded with no errors and only 14 hits combined for both teams in 14 innings.By the time the Jack Turner music collection began to repeat songs from innings before, the top of the Georgia line-up came up in the 13th. Despite intentionally walking Hugo, Iosefa’s hard hit ball landed in the glove of center fielder Franklin for the third out.In the bottom of the 14th, Cruce perfectly placed a groundball between Hugo and Iosefa on the right side of the infield for a base-hit, setting up a sacrifice bunt to move Cruce to second. With a runner in scoring position, freshman Carleigh Chaumont hit the left center wall above C.Emanuel’s head to score the winning run.The 2-1 loss forces Georgia up against the winner of the University of North Carolina and Central Connecticut State face-off tonight.

Michigan’s Megan Betsa gave up another run two batters later, as Tina Iosefa took the ball over the centerfield wall for a 3-0 lead.


 


By the top of the third, the Wolverines evened up the score, only to take to lead in the fourth on a solo home run. The extended the margin with two more runs in the fifth, making the score 6-3.Georgia came back in the bottom of the inning, when Anna Swafford reached first on an error by third baseman Lindsay Montemarano. Iosefa, who was 4-4 on the night, followed up with a double to right center, allowing Naija Griffin to score Swafford on a groundout.The Bulldogs made one last effort to compete with Michigan’s seven runs in the bottom of the seventh. Sydni Emanuel led off with a base-hit, setting up Swafford’s two-run home run to cut the score to 7-6. But a final pop out to second finished the inning and Georgia’s season.The Bulldogs ended with a 44-17 record, as the 55-6 Wolverines move on as one of eight teams to earn a spot in the Women’s College World Series in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma.","Jackie Kenney

3-Jun-15,Historic landmark undergoes preservation work,"Students might have noticed the construction of one of the defining sights of the north campus of the University of Georgia. Part of the Arch was taken down on May 19 for a period of preservation work for the first time in the history of the university.Additionally, an accessibility ramp has been approved by the administration near the Broad St. bus stop. However, some believe the university could be doing more for students with disabilities.The accessibility ramp will be constructed six feet west of the Arch and lead into north campus. However, the ramp does not help students with disabilities participate in a time-honored university tradition – passing through the Arch upon graduation.


 


The Arch as it stands today is positioned closely to a set of steps leading into the campus. Students in wheelchairs, for example, do not have room to maneuver around the posts of the Arch in order to pass under it.Rose Caplan, owner of NextPage Web Design, LLC and supporter of Arch accessibility, believes moving the Arch back from Broad St. by five feet to allow equal access to disabled students is a better solution.“The Arch will still be the gateway into the university, even if it’s pushed back,” Caplan said.Caplan and recent graduate Carden Wyckoff have been working to build wider recognition of the issue. Wyckoff began a page on Facebook named Make UGA’s Arch Accessible for this purpose, and the group has been gaining likes as well as successes.The group was key in establishing a temporary platform allowing students with disabilities to walk through the Arch. However, the administration rejected proposals to move the Arch itself so that all students could pass through it.“The temporary ramp alternative a day or two after graduation is largely disrespectful to mobility impaired students as they would have to wait a day or two after graduation to participate,” Caplan said. “In addition, the other 364 days of the year that passage through the Arch is inaccessible, students, alumnae, and visitors with mobility impairments are not afforded access to the Arch in violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act.”The stance of the administration so far has been that moving the Arch back would threaten its historical significance.Constructed sometime between 1856-1858, the Arch has stood in wind, rain and even ice to welcome new students into the university and see off departing graduates. The preservation work, carried out by the Facilities Management Division and CertaPro Painters, is expected to be completed by June 15.


 


“[The Arch] is an icon, it’s beloved,” said Preservation Planner for UGA Grounds Janine Duncan. “I think it’s the most famous piece of ironwork in North Georgia; it’s just as important as any building.”The preservation process is thus being carefully carried out, with attention being paid to future-proofing the structure. The weathering of the Arch is believed to have mostly been caused by natural, environmental effects.“Heat makes things expand, and cold makes it contract,” Duncan said. “You also have biological causes, such as plants and birds, and all of this accumulates.”To accomplish the preservation, the top part of the Arch has been dismantled while the three posts remain in the stone beneath. Work on the arc and lentil is being done by CertaPro, while the posts are being refurbished in-house by the University.“CertaPro is stripping the paint from the arc and lentil through a process known as garnet blasting,” said Director of Grounds Brett Ganas. “We had to totally dismantle [a part of the Arch] and then there are pieces that will have to be refabricated.”Once the pieces are reassembled, the Arch will be reconstructed exactly where it previously stood, with a minimal improvement in accessibility options.","Patrick Adcock

4-Jun-15,Southeastern Conference first to ban athletes with sexually violent crimes from transferring to other SEC schools,"The Southeastern Conference is used to coming in first. Whether it be in national championships or recruiting rankings, the conference is used to dominating and pacing not just in football but in all sports.So last week at the SEC meetings in Destin, Florida, it was hardly a surprise that the conference would be the first to institute a new transfer rule. The surprise was that the conference would  be restricting athletes with serious misconduct from transferring.The presidents of the 14 member schools approved a proposal by Georgia to bar transfer student-athletes who have committed a serious misconduct from playing at any of the schools in the SEC. The proposal defined serious misconduct as sexual assault, domestic violence or other forms of sexual violence.  


 


The rule change would have prevented Jonathan Taylor from transferring to Alabama. Taylor, a 6-foot-4, 335 four-star defensive lineman, signed with Georgia out of high school. On July 22 of last year, Taylor was kicked off the team after being arrested on charges of aggravated assault, battery and simple battery. After spending the fall at Copiah-Lincoln Community College in Mississippi, Taylor signed with Alabama in January, while he was still set to stand trial in Athens.On March 28, Taylor was charged for domestic violence third degree assault and domestic violence third degree criminal mischief. Taylor was then dismissed by Alabama. Taylor’s accuser in the March 28 incident later recanted her statement. In April, Taylor pled not guilty to the charges in Athens.The signing and dismissal of Taylor brought down intense scrutiny on Alabama head coach Nick Saban. And given the string of domestic violence incidents that the NFL has seen in the past year, teams are now being deterred to sign players who commit these atrocious acts. New SEC commissioner Greg Sankey, along with the 14 member schools are taking the decision out of their coaches hands. The proposed rule extends to all transfers, not just those who played at one SEC school and then transferring to another. This means that former Georgia quarterback Zach Mettenberger would not have been allowed to transfer to LSU. In 2010, Mettenberger pled guilty to two misdemeanor charges of sexual battery. Mettenberger spent a year at Butler Community College before transferring to LSU. Mettenberger started for the Tigers for two years and was drafted in the sixth round of the 2014 draft. The rule does not ban players who have been charged with a violent crime. This would mean that former LSU tailback Jeremy Hill would not have been barred from competing after he pled guilty to simple battery in 2013. This was after Hill pled guilty to having carnal knowledge with an underage girl as he was a senior in high school. According to Baton Rouge police department, Hill and a friend pressured the underage female, who was 14, to preform oral sex on him and his friend in a school locker room. After Hill’s second guilty plea, Les Miles, the LSU head coach, decided to let his team decide Hill’s fate. Hill’s teammates allowed him to remain with the team, and he became a second-round pick in the 2014 NFL Draft.It also appears that the rule is limited only to the defined serious misconduct. So when a player like Shaq Jones, a former Georgia cornerback who was kicked off the team for shoplifting, can still transfer to an SEC school. 


 


It is yet to be seen if players with felonies or other crimes that do not fit in the definition of serious misconduct can transfer to SEC schools, as would have been the case if former Georgia tailback Isaiah Crowell tried to transfer back into the SEC. Crowell was arrested on a felony charge of carrying a weapon in a school zone as well as a felony charge of having an altered ID mark in 2012 and was dismissed from Georgia. He then spent the next two years at Alabama State, before going undrafted in the 2014 NFL Draft. The SEC is the first to institute a rule that affects transfers. But the more important question is did the SEC go far enough? Not every team handles arrests the same. Some wondered if Sankey could give himself Roger Goodell-type power in policing his conference. Because if given the chance, coaches have shown that they will give talented players second and third chances. And as seen by the calamity of missteps by Goodell, having one person decide punishments is not the greatest of ideas. Teams will have the ability to file a wavier to get the conference to review an individual player’s case. This new rule isn’t a final step in stopping domestic violence. Players aren’t going to think, “this could prevent me from going to another SEC school,” in the moments before they lay their hands on a woman. And as long as players have the chance to transfer to the ACC, Pac-12 and other power conferences, players will still be granted a second chance. But the rule serves as long overdue first step. And while it mean seem unnecessary to police schools from common sense, the rule is a positive step in the right direction.","Connor Riley

6-Jun-15,Just Keep Swimming: Legion Pool opens once again,"As the University of Georgia works to preserve one icon of the school, the north campus Arch, another icon is similarly living to see another day.Legion Pool opened May 21 for another summer season; and for the foreseeable future, the pool will continue to operate.The Legion Pool has stood for over 77 years, residing in close proximity to the freshman dorms of the university. Athens residents and students alike have enjoyed summer swims there for decades, and the pool has witnessed landmark events in history, such as the school’s “Integration Day” in 1966.


 


However, with the move and expansion of Bolton Dining Commons, the future of Legion Pool was in doubt. Construction plans for the area did not include the pool, prompting local swimmers to fight for its preservation.“Campus Life feels like [the pool] never really breaks even,” said Sara Baker, an Athens resident who fought to have the pool recognized for its historical importance. “Whether or not it breaks even, it’s an amenity for students.”Baker created a website and Facebook page to rally residents to support the cause.“In 2012, the administration was asking for permission to go ahead and take [the pool] down. [People] were saying that you can’t go up against the administration, you’ll always lose,” Baker said.As the word spread and people began viewing the website and Facebook page, the effort snowballed and local media began to take notice. Baker believes it was the collective voice of the people which caused the administration to realize the importance of Legion Pool.“I think it’s really notable that we had so many people that worked on it. It was little people, not big powerful people, who stood up and said no, you can’t take this down,” Baker said.Stan Jackson, director of student affairs communications and marketing initiatives at UGA, explained that Legion Pool will be protected for the foreseeable future.“We generally follow the administration’s lead, and there is no action planned for Legion Pool,” Jackson said.

Arias had said from the beginning that he never meant to hurt anyone and that it was a prank. Now the charges could be dismissed. Arias was accepted into a pretrial diversion program, which if he completes and the charges are dropped, could lead to expungement of the arrest.In addition, Arias was suspended temporarily from the university.

11-Jun-15,Public outrage will not help police brutality,"The newest video of unnecessary police brutality, which has unfortunately become common enough to be a genre of videos, is that an officer slamming a young girl against a sidewalk in Mckinney, Texas.The incident Occurred after a pool party was held to celebrate the ending of the school year at Craig Ranch,a neighborhood with a private pool. Residents of Craig Ranch were allowed to bring themselves and up to two guests to the event, but many more people showed up than were expected. Eventually, a fight broke out between two of the residents, and the police were called to control the group of now over one hundred teens at the pool.When the three police officers arrive, they immediately call for back-up, and then the incident occurs, where Officer Eric Casebolt attempts to control the unruly crowd and ends up slamming a girl to the ground and then drawing his gun on another man.


 


But Casebolt’s reaction to this chaos is not a productive one. In fact, I think it’s nearly the worst possible. I don’t see how throwing a young girl on the ground helps calm a crowd - and pulling out your pistol and aiming it definitely has the opposite effect. Casebolt’s lack of restraint would be unhelpful at any other job, but as a police officer it is not only unhelpful, but life threatening.Peter Schulte, a former McKinney officer, said this about the incident: “This is a classic example of how something can escalate out of control very quickly by the actions of the officers, not by what was going on.”The fallout from this video has led to many bringing up the issue of race. While I can’t speak for Casebolt, many members of the Craig Ranch community, black and white, have spoken up, saying that there is a lot of misinformation because of the video.Maurice Gray, a resident of Craig Ranch, said, ""It wasn't a black or white thing,” and that “People only see a seven minute clip of a thirty minute incident.”Benet Embry, another resident, is quoted in an NBC news article saying, ""I want to tell people outside this community that this is not Baltimore, this is not Ferguson, it's nothing like that…My neighbors are good neighbors. We're not racist.”The online reaction, as well as the people I’ve discussed the incident with, remind me a lot of Casebolt’s reaction in the video: people jumping to conclusions about something they saw seven minutes of is only going to fuel the controversy. While Casebolt’s actions were certainly unjustified, unnecessary and brutal, our response to them does not have to be. We can look at the situation and respond in a rational and reasonable way.This entire situation is a perfect microcosm of the epidemic of police brutality in the United States: It’s an out-of-control situation with an out-of -control response. Too often innocents are shot by or brutalized by police officers on flimsy premises. And while we, the public, do respond to these tragedies in force, we do it sporadically and without direction. We cannot gain control of these situations if we cannot control ourselves.I urge everyone to learn more about what happened before condemning the residents of Craig Ranch or Casebolt. Do they deserve condemning? Decide for yourselves, using more than just a seven minute clip. By responding with uncontrolled outrage, we are no better than Casebolt. And that only makes the situation worse.

14-Jun-15,Communication Modification,"Graduation can be daunting. Finals, job hunts, and engagements all conspire to raise our stress to hazardous levels. Another sneaky factor contributing to all of this stress is the status of our relationships, both platonic and romantic. Will we break up? Will our friendship drift off into oblivion? Not if you go through some simple communication modifications.Heading into graduation, communication with our friends and roommates may be erratic. This is the time of year where gaps in typically stable communication patterns arise. Everyone has finals stress, job anxiety and it’s easier to withdraw and get lost in the stress. If you’re an avoider, you won’t want to talk about it. And that may be okay in some circumstances, if you can “postpone some of those discussions to when you’re out of that tunnel and back into your normal self,” says Jennifer Samp, professor of communication studies. “Periods of turmoil, there’s a lot more conflicts about little picky things, things that just wouldn’t really matter when everybody’s in a calmer mode. So that’s where we see a lot of conflict peaking at the end of the semester, always.”If you’ve made it this far with passive-aggressive roommate notes, you may want to sit down and talk it out so this next part becomes easier.


 


“A lot of research calls graduation, or labels them as turning points,” says Samp. “And there are also other turning points in our lives that college students experience them too. So when they go from one dorm to another, or they have opportunities to meet other people, those are turning points as well. But, that graduation moment is a huge turning point because it’s pretty rare that people actually stay in the same area together.” This physical separation doesn’t have to translate to emotional separation too. Finding time to spend together, even if it’s only once a year because of the distance, can work wonders for keeping a relationship intact.If you’ve made it through graduation, congrats!Setting ground rules for after graduation is key. This way, everyone involved has realistic expectations about the future. “…If you’re in a long-distance relationship or in a relationship where you’re both taking on new jobs, it’s really important to sit down and lay it out: ‘here’s what I’m dealing with, how can we work on this?’” says Samp. “And then, it sounds challenging and it’s not spontaneous, but to set up appointments where you actually talk together and appreciate each others’ new lives, because it’s not as easy.”Not allowed to text on the job? Let your friends know so they don’t freak out and you’re not the one in the office whose phone is constantly (and distractingly) buzzing. Tell your boyfriend you’re not ignoring him, you’re just busy and promise to set a time to Skype later. Otherwise, they may start to think they’re the problem. “Trying to take those steps ahead of time to eliminate some of those misattributions can help,” Samp says.Take some time to figure out as much as you can and leave the rest up to spontaneous adventures as you discover your post-grad life. If you plan to keep in touch with your friends and make an effort to make your relationships work, in-person or using technology, you’ll be prepared to take on the coming times.",Diondra Powers,ampersand,https://www.redandblack.com/ampersand/communication-modification/article_695eaa80-12e6-11e5-8a24-d78a852b60e9.html
14-Jun-15,Table for One,"When summer sets in and the 35,000 students head home for the summer, Athens empties out into a laid back, quieter type of town. Packed restaurants finally have seats open for coveted Sunday brunch, and Milledge Avenue is, for once, somewhat peaceful.Take advantage of the calm and quiet to explore some of the more crowded Athens venues that fill up quickly, have lines out the door and are a hassle to visit during the school year!Mama’s Boy: This traditionally Southern restaurant is famous for its home-cooked breakfasts and brunch, but is typically crowded on the average weekend in Athens. The locally owned venue features all of the Southern style favorites with a twist, from “Pulled pork and hash” to “Salmon Cakes Benedict.” Grab some friends and indulge in an authentic, hearty breakfast without worrying about the wait!


 


The Last Resort: Unlike the name suggests, this restaurant serves up classic cuisine with a flair, taking American favorites like the beef short rib and giving them a mouth watering makeover. Slow cooking freshly caught fish with herbs and spices, with farm fresh salads on the side creates a memorable meal and fine dining experience. While during the school year it serves as the go-to restaurant to show parents, it becomes a less packed and more accessible spot that would be perfect for a date or a nice dinner with friends.Hendershot’s Coffee Shop: It’s a quirky coffee shop by day and music venue by night, serving up delicious brews on the weekdays and brunch on Sunday morning. If you’re looking for a place to study during the school year, tables are often hard to come by, but when the students are gone, Hendershot’s is the perfect place to grab a cup of coffee and read a book for the afternoon. With a patio outside and plenty of comfy couches indoors, it’s a cozy but spacious place to pass the afternoon. Throughout the summer they offer music performances at night, featuring a blend of local Athenian artists and other Southern performers. And, if you need a bite to eat, there are several local restaurants nearby from The Grit to Taqueria del Sol to explore and enjoy!

The State Botanical Gardens: These picturesque gardens are home to more than well-tended flower beds and a variety of native plant species; there are lengthy walking and running trails, an indoor greenhouse that hosts cultural events, and plenty of serene areas to get away from the city, only 5 miles away from downtown! While the gardens aren’t typically crowded, many people visit daily throughout the year. But, when the weather is at its most beautiful, pack a picnic lunch and head out to the gardens for a stroll through the forest or to meditate undisturbed in the peace and quiet.Sandy Creek Nature Center: Popular throughout the year, the nature center features not only trails and forested areas, but also a large lake for kayakers and paddle borders to spend an afternoon in the summer sun. It also has several grilling areas to make burgers after getting off the water, and beaches with volleyball courts. In the summer when the regulars clear out, the lake will be open for on-the-water activities! It’s larger than Redneck beach, with more room for boats and boards, so grab a carful of friends and head down on a spare weekend.

24-Jun-15,Charleston: We need to talk about race,"When I first encountered the headlines of the Charleston church shooting, my chest crumpled in the same way when I first heard of the deaths of Michael Brown, Eric Garner, Kalief Browder and the many more names mentioned and unmentioned. The connection between these deaths is that they are those of black men and women and that these deaths have brought up national discussions of race.Unfortunately, race is a volatile topic of discussion. The longstanding racial inequity of the United States has sparked protests but those protests have not fulfilled their purposes of addressing and combating racial inequality. We, as a whole country, refuse to discuss race relations on a necessary, long-term and profound level because 1) we would have to admit that the United States has many problems that are rooted in racial inequity and 2) we, as present day individuals, believe we are blameless for the current racial inequity and therefore do not believe we need to engage in earnest interest, discussion and action to address our history.On July 17, 2015, Dylann Roof, a 21 year-old white male, entered the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church, one of the oldest black churches and sites for civil rights organization, and sat down with 13 people participating in a bible study. After an hour, Roof stood up and began to shoot the people, leaving nine dead and one wounded.


 


While I offer my deepest condolences for the families and community of the victims, I remain contemptuous of the aftermath in how the media has painstakingly humanized Roof and how the primary motive for Roof’s act of pure terrorism flies below the radar.It is beyond obvious that Roof’s crime was racially motivated as indicated by his choice in the scene of his crime, the cruel words he uttered to the black man who questioned why he would do such a thing, and his personal history of proudly wearing and displaying white supremacist symbols.I agree with President Obama’s statement: “There’s no other advanced nation on Earth that tolerates multiple shootings on a regular basis and considers it normal. To some degree, that’s what’s happened to this country. It’s become something we expect.”It is absolutely necessary we discuss the stigma of mental illness, gun control laws, child abuse and additional factors that potentially contribute to horrific crimes.However, in crimes where the offender is a white male instead of a black male, media outlets discuss possible theories of mental illness, lax gun control and prior abuse in attempts to humanize the offender. There is an unwavering double standard for non-white people who commit crimes and white people who commit the same crimes. Those who are white have the “privilege” of having their motives examined in attempts of humanization and will have the right of a quick and fair trial.Although Roof murdered nine people, he is not the only one that needs to be held accountable: we all need to hold ourselves accountable because unless we address current social injustices intersecting with race, we will most likely see crimes like the Charleston church shooting occur again.In order to make long-lasting change, we cannot count on our political leaders and government to take initiative and must voice the changes we want to see. I hope that people are made incredibly agitated, saddened and uncomfortable by this crime because it is only through our discomfort, and perhaps disgust, that we will start to acknowledge our own reluctance in discussing race in America.- Ha Truong is a rising junior from Suwanee majoring in English and biology.

27-Jun-15,From American Idol to AthFest: Sam Burchfield presents innovative set,"Sam Burchfield goes from his American Idol to making his first daytime AthFest appearance, and his set was one of the best of the entire first day.Having a large six-piece band backing him, his sound was large, varied and infectious. His horn section specifically — featuring a trombone, trumpet and saxophone — all provided a lot of characters and soul to his music, and all three gave fantastic solos when given the opportunity. They even walked throughout the crowd playing at one point getting the crowd very involved.Fan favorite tracks like “Here Tonight” went off without a hitch, and he mixed up his more radio-friendly tracks by throwing in plenty of straight-up blues and funk tracks.  His song “Monopoly” definitely housed the biggest surprise when midway through the bluesy song, he decides to cover Outkast’s “Sorry Ms. Jackson,” with effective results.


 


That wasn’t the only time he rapped. After giving his bassist a solo, I thought I heard the bassist transition to the bass grove from The Sugarhill Gang’s hit, “Rapper’s Delight.” I was correct, as that was the energetic closer for Burchfield.This was a fantastic overall performance that showed the many different musical sides and influences of one of Athens brightest young stars.",Zach Hansen @zach_ehansen,variety,https://www.redandblack.com/variety/music/from-american-idol-to-athfest-sam-burchfield-presents-innovative-set/article_46dc4720-1d17-11e5-b267-ff6f83093843.html
28-Jun-15,of Montreal plays with reality to entertain,"What do dancing ghosts, boxing dogs and waltzing Abraham Lincolns have in common? They are all things you can expect to see join Kevin Barnes and of Montreal on stage of course.of Montreal shows have always been a means of replacing reality with the fictional and absurd and this year was no different. Athfest goers watched in bewilderment as a sun hat and poncho clad Kevin Barnes danced, jumped, and strutted across the stage as beach balls were propelled into the audience.However, behind all the antics, showmanship and downright absurdity remains a deeply inspired, clever and compositionally gifted group of musicians.


 


This year at AthFest, fans watched as of Montreal seamlessly interwove the fast, visceral post-punk of their most recent record, “Aureate Gloom,"" the Americana tinged country rock of their 2013 album, “Lousy With Sylvianbriar” as well as a decade of infectiously catchy glam rock and pop. Kevin Barnes and of Montreal flawlessly and convincingly covered more than a decade of material in an hour and a half long setlist.As Barnes jumped and screeched in his trademark falsetto in front of a loud, excited and energetic crowd of AthFest goers that had assembled to see one of Athens’ most prized music acts, he painted the picture of a man wearied by heartbreak and loss, yet will continue to dance through it all.“We’ve got to keep our little click clicking at 130 bpm. It’s not too slow. If we’ve got to burn out, let’s do it together,"" frontman and songwriter Kevin Barnes sang in his unmistakable croon.However, if of Montreal’s performance at AthFest proved anything, it’s that he is still dancing as fast as he can, and he is nowhere near burning out.",Cooper Casale @redandblack,variety,https://www.redandblack.com/variety/music/of-montreal-plays-with-reality-to-entertain/article_0422ccbe-1dc7-11e5-8d9e-ab83df1b2b61.html
28-Jun-15,AthFest Hip-Hop Showcase goes old school,"Hip-hop has never been a prominent genre of music in Athens. Athens has always gravitated towards the indie rock, art pop and country scenes, but over the last two years, AthFest has tried to showcase local rap talent.At this year’s Many Faces of Hip Hop 2.0 showcase at Ciné, one thing was made very apparent; this was going to be raw, hard-hitting, old school hip-hop down to its core. From the presentation to the beats to the stage, everything attempted to go back to the genre's roots.The first thing audiences surely noticed was the odd choice of stage setup. There was no conventional stage, no flashy lights, and no big set pieces. All that was there was a DJ table, a couple of microphones and a merchandise table.


 


This may seem a little jarring or cheap upon first glance, but this design is a throwback to the old block parties thrown in the inner cities of New York, Atlanta and Chicago during the early '80s where the genre gained underground popularity.The first hour also seemed like a bit of a tribute, as the DJ was the main focus with the emcee acting like a hype man. Sadly, this section fell pretty flat as there weren’t enough people participating in the dancing and partying until the first rapper came up.There’s a little bit of confusion as far as the bill is concerned, as the first emcee to come up and rap was Kaliko, who isn’t even on the original set list! I don’t know if the first two performers, Chief Rocka and Catch One Baldie, couldn’t make it, so Kaliko performed instead.He was the worst rapper of the night. To his credit, he did a great job getting people up on their feet and involved in the show, but with sour lines such as “fresher than a fruit/flyer than a plane,” there wasn’t much substance to his raps.One hilarious part of his set was the video that was playing in the background. It looked like a mix between a cliché rap music video and an EDM promotional video. Multiple times, the video would just cut to huge text saying, “Damn” or  “Yahatin.” Funny stuff, but I couldn’t tell if it was being self-aware or playing it straight. For Kaliko’s sake, I hope it was a form of parody.Luckily the next three rappers gave the best performances of the night. Squalle, one of the youngest rappers of the night, had a lot of energy and demanded attention. Most of his raps were brag raps, but they were better executed and featured a few solid punch lines.However, the self-titled “femcee” Chrismis absolutely stole the show. Female rappers aren’t as prominent as their male counterparts in stereotypical hip-hop culture, but she was absolutely spitting fire. Her flow was fast, abrasive and hard-hitting. She took no prisoners.Amun-Ra featuring Daniel the Prophet came out next, and they definitely made an impact as well. Amun’Ra’s dress definitely turned heads, as he carried a large staff and wore a rope and this fez-like hat. But his flow was on point, and multiple times he and Daniel rapped solo without a beat to great results. Their lyrics and beats also brought back memories of old-school political icons Public Enemy and Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five.


 


Right after that set, Blacknerd(ninjas) made a surprise appearance and gave a short performance that was just as solid as its Hull St. show earlier in the day.Honestly, the rest of the night was kind of forgettable and dragged on a bit, but no one gave awful performances and the night was still a lot of fun overall. If there is a showcase next year, fans of old school hip-hop definitely shouldn’t miss out.",Zach Hansen @zach_ehansen,variety,https://www.redandblack.com/variety/music/athfest-hip-hop-showcase-goes-old-school/article_7b762dfe-1e00-11e5-884a-5be14fe08891.html
29-Jun-15,Major expansion in Savannah imports lead to job increase for entire state,"After a 15 year-long effort the Savannah Harbor Expansion Project is underway.This project aims to deepen seven miles of the Savannah River channel from 42 feet to 47 feet, allowing larger vessels to enter the port more conveniently and more frequently.“When I think of Savannah, I think of the St. Patrick’s Day Parade, beachin’ at Tybee Island, and its historical landmarks said digital broadcast major, Hunter Roagland, a junior from Atlanta.


 


Savannah provides Georgia with priceless tourist experiences and attractions because it is the birthing ground for a lot of state and national historical events. On top of that, there is one place in Savannah that is the heartbeat of Georgia’s economic growth.With the expansion of the harbor, this will mean much more than an increase in imports in Georgia.“To me it has 3 parts of interest: environmental impact, economic impact, and legal” Kris Mcwhite, an economics professor at the University of Georgia said.Specifically this project targets the ability of Panamax ships to enter the harbor. With Panamax ships able to enter Robert Morris Senior Director of Corporate Communications at Georgia Ports Authority forecasts reduced costs for shippers, more products and fewer ships leading to lessened emissions.“This deepening is critical to ongoing success of the Port of Savannah and the Georgia Port Authority,” he said. According to a recent UGA study, Georgia’s two ports offer nearly 400,000 full time and part time jobs in the state. In basic terms, this study also found that one out of every 12 jobs in the state exists as a result of Georgia’s two ports.Locally, Athens-Clarke County has 4,180  jobs as a direct result of the Port of Savannah. In total the jobs Georgia’s ports and private docks provide makes up 8.3 percent of Georgia’s total employment.In addition to employment, Georgia’s deepwater ports significant economic impact can be measured in terms of state, local, and federal tax revenue.


 


For state and local in the fiscal year 2011 tax collections totaled more than 1 billion dollars in each sector. For the federal government, Georgia’s deepwater ports provide 4.5 billion dollars in taxes alone.While these numbers are impressive, Director of Selig Center for Economic Growth, Jeffrey M. Humphreys, explains why the Savannah Harbor Expansion Project is necessary.“The Savannah Harbor Expansion Project will provide room for growth for Georgia’s port and will overtime provide Georgia with additional jobs,"" Humphreys said. ""The challenge was not only to create additional jobs but maintain the jobs we already have.”He said that without the expansion as the shipping industry grows and uses more Panamax vessels a lot of the ships will divert to other ports. With less use of the ports, less jobs will be needed – so the goal of the expansion was more than just allowing these ships in but to help the people with existing jobs.Many ships, such as Panamax vessels are constricted by Savannah’s high and low tide which economically weighs on both the distributor and the receiver.“In order to even stay competitive or maintain the existing 369,000 full or part time jobs in the state this project is absolutely critical,"" Morris said. ""Our customers have stayed with us because our progress getting this project done. Without a deeper harbor we could not stay in business at the level we are at today.”This project received a cost benefit analysis of 5.5 to 1.0 which means for every one dollar investors spend, five and a half dollars are made in revenue, which is an increase in profit.The Georgia Ports Authority went through an intense mitigation process to ensure the safety of the environment before this project was even approved.

“Early on we created a stake-holders foundation group and so we were engaged from the very beginning with members of the community, members of the environmental community, the environmental sciences, to determine what would be the best way to mitigate the environmental impacts of the project,"" Morris said.This process created a cost of about 40 percent – 282.4 milllion dollars – of the 706 million dollar project he said.The major environmental processes in place include the incorporation of a dissolved oxygen system which will pump oxygen back into the water, a fish bypass that will allow fish to bypass construction and reach the up grounds they need, and 2,245 acres of wetlands purchased by the state authority will be added to Savannah National Wildlife.The Savannah Harbor Expansion Project is scheduled for completion in 2020.","Emily Boyer

29-Jun-15,Honeychild awkwardly changes pace,"Under the sweltering heat of Sunday afternoon, Athfest goers are typically bombarded by the metallic pounding of brass instruments, the ceaseless march of percussion, and endless guitar riffing. However, Honeychild fronted by Sara-Jean Ursrey, was a drastic change of pace.Equipped with a ukulele, guitar, the click of her high heeled shoes and layers of reverb, Ursrey wove a sparse and atmospheric texture for listerners that was unexpected if not out of place.Ursery used her ukulele to set up a counterpoint with her voice as she maneuvered over, under and through the dancing ukulele and guitar parts with her alto croon.


 


However, listeners was quickly distracted from Ursery’s jagged harmonies by the relentlessly thick reverb applied to both the ukulele and guitar. Though employed to make the music atmospheric, the songs were quickly rendered unintelligible by the reverb that reduced the sound quality of the set.In many ways Honeychild’s atmospheric music was a refreshing break from brass and rock bands around Athfest, but in the process Honeychild failed to captivate its audience.",Cooper Casale @redandblack,variety,https://www.redandblack.com/variety/honeychild-awkwardly-changes-pace/article_d461e598-1e9b-11e5-8e26-d3e0b572b6eb.html
2-Jul-15,Federal aid falls while student loan debt rises,"It will surprise almost no one to learn that funding to higher education has nationally, on average, been decreasing in recent years just as funding to almost everything else has decreased as well. This has happened on both a federal and state level and has resulted in universities struggling to find way to cut costs as well as find other ways to bridge gaps in their budget.The University of Georgia is no exception to this rule. The effects of the 2007 recession and the slow growth since are still being felt today.  Even though state budgets are now beginning to level out, the state appropriations that the university is allocated are still lower than pre-recession levels.“Things are stabilizing and FY15 was the first time in many years the institution had seen raises,” said Holley Schramski, associate vice president of University Business and Accounting Services.


 


James Shore, the senior associate vice president for finance and administration and budget director, added that the university is now able to begin hiring faculty to fill vacancies that were left open during the hiring freeze.Both Shore and Schramski mentioned that a remaining financial hindrance for the university is the continued decline in research funding. They said part of the budget reductions is attributable to decreases in available research dollars since the recession. As a research institution, a significant portion of the university’s budget relies on research funding.It is not just the recession that is responsible for this drop. The policies enacted after the close of the recession have done their part as well. The sequestration that went into effect in 2013 slashed research spending and some of those policies are still in place, though the cuts have lessened.While these policies have affected university revenue, student aid programs have not been as affected by budget cuts at the state and federal level.“Federal budget cuts did not impact federal student aid to the degree grant funding was impacted. In Georgia, appropriations are not made for student aid. However, the indirect effects of state appropriations going down could account for more coming out of the pockets of students,” Shore said.Many students in Georgia have an advantage that students in all but seven other states don’t have – the HOPE scholarship.   This is a lottery funded program and not considered state aid because taxpayer money does not contribute to the fund.  Instead, HOPE and other grants, loans, and scholarships such as Zell Miller, are all administered by the Georgia Student Finance Commission.  These programs have helped many students lessen or negate college funding woes.“Fortunately I qualified for Zell, which paid for my tuition, and I managed to keep it throughout college. I also received the Pell grant, which helped with books and fees,” said Sarah Anne Perry, a recent UGA graduate who majored in English.  “I feel very fortunate because I know if I had lived somewhere without Georgia’s financial aid options, I might have years of loan payments ahead of me.”HOPE programs have helped more than 1.4 million students in Georgia obtain a degree since it first began in 1993.  These funds are legislatively controlled and subject to legislative changes. 


 


“These programs were created by the Georgia General Assembly and are subject to annual appropriations,” said Chris Green, director of government relations at GSFC, when asked if the funding for GSFC programs had changed over the past five years.HOPE has changed many times since going into effect.  Most recently, both HOPE and Zell underwent a makeover in 2011 which eliminated funding for books, fees, and remedial classes.  Instead of paying full tuition, HOPE now covers a variable percentage of tuition while Zell awards full tuition up to $2,174 per semester.   Another major change was to cap the number of eligible semester hours at 127 attempted or completed hours.  These changes resulted in 62,504 fewer HOPE recipients statewide in that year alone.This leaves a gap in funding for students.  Many turn to student loans to cover education and living expenses.“Because my tuition is covered by HOPE and Zell, I only took out loans to pay for the university fees,” said Teylor Jo Parks, a 19-year-old student of English and sociology from Ringgold.Parks mentioned she took more loan money her first year to cover her meal plan and housing expenses.  This past year, she accepted less in loan money because she obtained a job which helped voer the expenses.Perry worked while in school and managed to avoid incurring any debt.“Financial aid was enough to cover most school expenses, but I still had to work to pay the bills. It was really hard sometimes, and I considered taking out a loan more than once, but in the end I’m glad I was able to graduate debt-free,” Perry said.The Pell Grant that helped Perry cover book expenses and university fees has seen other changes in recent years.  To make up for shortfalls, the program’s eligibility rules were modified in 2012.  This included lowering the maximum income limits for those receiving no family contributions towards their education.  The limit went from $32,000 to $23,000, immediately dropping those who were previously receiving aid but made over $23,000 a year in income.  Since Pell award amounts are on a sliding scale based on income, this also meant that 274,000 other students saw their awards lowered by an average of $715.

7-Jul-15,'True Detective' sets up enthralling season,"For the second week in a row, the opening scene of ""True Detective"" has been completely enthralling. Last week, a dark Vince Vaughn monologue trapped our attention, and this week, Collin Farrell’s supernatural encounter did the same.The juxtaposition of a live version of the song “Some Say Love” in the background with Velcoro navigating his near death dream is gripping.  In the dream, his character finally feels some shame when his father tells him “You got your father's hands,"" only to realize his hands are bruised and covered in blood. The double meaning is a pleasant device for providing more insight into Velcoro, especially after the show introduces his dad, an alcoholic and retired dirty cop.The tension in ""True Detective"" increases on a continuous rise. There is an effective scene parallel when Bezzerides’ boss wants her to expose Velcoro, and Velcoro’s boss wants Bezzerides gone. Bezzerides and Velcoro have been feuding from the start, but now we see Bezzerides and Woodrugh get into a scrap. Maybe that’s just the nature of frustrating police work.


 


Another tension occurs at the crime scene where Velcoro took two shots of pellet BB’s. The cliché tug-of-war of which department has ownership over a crime scene ensues, which something I wish the show would have been above. Inter-departmental fights can be found in every crime drama, so it’s a trite element at this point.More plot development goes down in Woodrugh’s sphere, and we learn that whatever happened in the dessert was tragic enough to haunt one of his fellow soldiers. The fact that merely mentioning the incident drives Woodrugh to insanity further amplifies the severity of the military tragedy.  Another development with Woodrugh is his random run-in with Semyon, which foreshadows that something big will transpire between those characters.  Semyon continues his wild goose chase for the mole in his group and further exerts his authority by utterly whooping the scariest-looking of his associates, strategically, in front of everybody.Another good performance is logged by Vince Vaughn with his rising loss of control. He gives us a look before the screen fades to imply the maybe his mole was in arms reach all along, the mole being his wife. Although a more covert cliffhanger, this week's ending along with other foreshadowing leads me to believe that an episode of epic proportions is on the horizon.",Wes Jones @who_wesjones |,variety,https://www.redandblack.com/variety/true-detective-sets-up-enthralling-season/article_949f4bbc-249a-11e5-bced-1b87c653e27d.html
10-Jul-15,Morehead moves into second year,"After assuming his position as president of the University of Georgia on July 1, 2013, President Jere W. Morehead now celebrates two years of service to the institution. A 1980 graduate from the UGA School of Law who returned to the institution and served in various faculty and administrative positions, Morehead was selected as president because of his passion for the institution and service to its students.When he was selected, Morehead knew that, in part, his success as president was determined by his ability to raise private funds to support the university.


 


In his first year as president, a record $126.4 million in new gifts and commitments were raised, reflecting an eight percent increase in fundraising from 2014.“I think setting records in fundraising for the institution for two consecutive years is most important in my role because it makes everything else happen at the institution,” Morehead said. Funds are 10 percent ahead of last year’s record, lining up UGA for another strong year of fundraising, he said.  “President Morehead has positively impacted the university, especially in fundraising, which is perhaps a president’s most important responsibility given the decline in public funding,” said Peter Smagorinsky, research professor of English education in the College of Education.“Strengthening the faculty is very important because great faculty recruit great students,” Morehead said.Morehead launched both an interdisciplinary hiring initiative and a research faculty-hiring initiative and has implemented merit-based raises for faculty for the first time since 2009.The University has welcomed three Georgia Alliance Eminent Scholars and added more than 20 endowed faculty positions over the past two years, Morehead said.“After being in office for only three months, I can truly say that I am excited to be working with President Morehead over the next year,” said Johnelle Simpson, president of the Student Government Association. “He and his administration are undeniably student focused and want to make sure that our experience, as well as education, are the best that UGA can offer.”


 


Andrew Herod, a distinguished professor in the department of geology, appreciates the president for addressing teacher concerns as well.“He has lobbied hard for pay increases for faculty and staff and has used some of UGA’s internal funding to support those,” Herod said. “These are well appreciated after several years of no pay raises and have been an important morale booster.” The incoming freshman classes have been record breaking in terms of academic quality, and the six-year graduation rate rose to 84.6 percent from 83.2 percent in 2013.“Students are what this institution at its core is all about,” Morehead said. “When I think about what I enjoy most it is seeing our students succeed.”A new undergraduate research assistantship program and experiential learning program have been launched during Morehead’s presidency. Morehead considered the Experiential Learning Initiative a key success of his presidency thus far. “The provost, the deans and I worked very hard with many faculty leaders on campus to move that proposal forward to get it passed at the end of the spring,” Morehead said. “Then we could spend this next year working on the details of implementing the proposal.”“I continue to be impressed with President Morehead and his vision for the university,” said Julie Luft, athletic association professor of science education in the College of Education. 


TNCMS.AdManager.render({region: 'fixed-big-ad-bottom-asset', slot: 1, fold: ""below""});


“We are going to continue to do things that will show our commitment to putting our students first,” Morehead said. “For me, one of the things that we are really focused upon is continuing to build our endowment for our need-based and merit scholarships for our students.”Continuing construction of a world-class learning environment, such as the renovations to the Terry College of Business and addition of a Science Learning Center, promotion of diversity on campus and increasing dedication to UGA’s land-grant mission to assist the state of Georgia in job creation and economic development are all initiatives that will also continue to be important to the president of the institution. As president of UGA, Morehead said that he hopes students and faculty view him as accessible and as someone who cares about the institution. He will be teaching a Freshman Odyssey class in the fall.","Lindsey Conway

13-Jul-15,Engineering Sound,"Athens is known for its music scene, but what would the musicians sound like if there was no one to run their show? Someone is always sitting in front of a board controlling all the sound: from instruments to vocals.There’s more to music than what you hear right away and the guys and girls who know it best are the sound engineers at some of the local venues in Athens.“Sound mixing is whatever you want it to be,” says Gene Woolfolk from the Caledonia Lounge. “Someone needs to make bands louder so the audience can hear them as intended.”


 


Not only do they control the volume so crowds can hear, they work with the levels of each individual part of the sound. They change the way the band members are heard so the audience gets the best possible experience.Last year AthFest had some major technical difficulties with the set of Reptar and there were rumors of bad sound at other venues as well.“So many things go wrong. It’s a two way street. From an audience’s perspective, if something goes wrong on the band’s end, it’s the engineer’s fault,” Woolfolk said. “If something goes wrong on the engineer’s end, it’s engineer’s fault. Name the problem: let’s fix it.”Woolfolk was right, usually bad sound isn’t anything the band has done.It’s a combination of things on the end of the sound engineer. If even the slightest thing gets mixed up or bumped up too high or down too low, the whole thing can be thrown off. The best sound engineers are the ones who can fix it without causing any other major issues.With big events like AthFest and all the other shows that are consistently being played Athens is a good place for these sound mixers to be.“Big events mean more work and everyone loves work,” Woolfolk said.He also talked about the performances and how sometimes the job can be interesting while other times it can be boring though at the end of the day, Woolfolk said, it was cool but not to quit your day job.",Nicolle Sartain,ampersand,https://www.redandblack.com/ampersand/engineering-sound/article_0b7ce748-295b-11e5-9cc5-df57310076d4.html
13-Jul-15,SEC Media Days: Don't forget about Vanderbilt's Ralph Webb,"HOOVER, Ala. -- The Southeastern Conference was mesmerized by a pair of freshmen running backs last season. Georgia’s Nick Chubb stepped up in Todd Gurley’s absence and recorded more than 1,500 rushing yards. LSU’s Leonard Fournette proved the hype surrounding him was real, taking 187 carries for 1,034 yards and 10 touchdowns.Even though these two tailbacks garnered most of the attention, they weren’t the only talented SEC newbies in 2014. Among those overlooked was Vanderbilt Commodores running back Ralph Webb, who has his attention set on even more success.Webb had a solid season in what was a forgettable year for the Commodores. After Jerron Seymour missed the season opener against Temple, Webb took advantage of the situation and did not relinquish the lead role. He ended the season with a team-high 907 rushing yards along with 4.3 yards per carry and four touchdowns.


 


Webb doesn’t bother comparing himself to Chubb, Fournette or any other player. He’s more focused on getting better and making a dent in Vanderbilt’s record books.""I just look forward to being the best running back that I can be,” Webb said. “I think there's always room for improvement. I want to be the best to ever do it, in college and the National Football League. I want to be the best player to ever come out of Vanderbilt and be legendary.""The numbers show that he’s off to a solid start. Webb finished 2014 ranked 12th in rushing yards among freshmen, beating out players like Tennessee’s Jalen Hurd. He proved himself durable as well and finished the season with 212 carries, third among SEC running backs. This consistency will be required for Webb to meet his lofty goals.His success did not go unnoticed by Vanderbilt head coach Derek Mason, who saw Webb shine on offense last season.“There are special players all across the country, and I believe Ralph Webb is a special player for our team,” Mason said. “I believe Ralph is going to be better than he was a year ago. Ralph will show us how good he's going to be when we have a chance to line up and play between the white lines.”Webb still has plenty of room for improvement. In order to reach the level of what Mason called “a three-dimensional back”, he has to improve his pass-blocking ability. Webb is the first to admit it is a weak point, but his acknowledgment is the first step to better results. He will also have to improve his receiving; he managed just 10 catches for 30 yards one year ago. While it may have been a product of departed offensive coordinator Karl Dorrell’s offensive scheme, it will nevertheless need work in the upcoming years.The Commodores will need players to step up if they want to compete in 2015 and Webb needs to be one of them. He has already done so from a leadership role, putting aside his own comfortability to voice what needs to be said for the team. If he can couple that with even more success from the backfield, Vanderbilt may be a surprise contender this fall.""It's great to have a running back like Ralph Webb,"" senior center Spencer Pulley said. “I've blocked for some great running backs through the years, some that played in the NFL. Ralph is the kind of guy that you want on your team. He's got the talent to be a great running back.""

14-Jul-15,SEC Media Days: Mississippi State made the leap. What comes next?,"HOOVER, Ala. -- Last season Mississippi State made the “leap”, or the rise from being just a good team to being a great one.Now comes the question of can the Bulldogs replicate their results. Or was last season’s 10-win success a blip?While the Bulldogs do suffer some personnel losses, the most-important piece from last season’s success returns in the form of quarterback Dak Prescott. The senior returned to school after his junior year saw him pass for 3,449 yards and rush for 986.


 


The biggest reason for Prescott’s return was to alleviate the pain of losing three of the last four games of the season, and turning back into the Mississippi State of old.“I just wasn’t too fond of the way I finished,” Prescott said. “Losing three of the last four left a sour taste in my mouth and I just didn’t want to leave my teammates or the great people of Starkville like that.”So long as Prescott stays healthy, Mississippi State should at least be a challenger to win the West division of the Southeastern Conference. As for the long term health of the Mississippi State program, head coach Dan Mullen thinks that it is at a point where it can be a consistent program every year.The key for him and his players will come in the form of avoiding those significant dips in performance that plague many SEC teams.""What you have to do is manage the season, manage the program as a whole, to maintain where, if you can win eight or nine games every single year, you have the chance to have those special years to get up to 12, 13, 14 wins,” Mullen said. “So if we can keep our program -- I think we're averaging eight wins a year over the last five years, a little more than that -- it's going to put you in a position to have those special years to make championship runs.”With a 10-win season fresh in the rearview mirror, some would expect Mississippi State to carry around some more respect. But many think that the Bulldogs will have one of those dips, and fall into the doldrums of the SEC.Mullen, who wore a pair of Yeezy Boosts-- or the Kanye West’s shoes-- to his press conference, is just looking to find the happy medium where the Bulldogs matter, so that they can make a leap every few years. Because it is almost impossible to contend for a national championship every season, according to Mullen.“When you look at how tough that league is, I think you're going to be hard pressed for anybody to compete every single year for a championship,” Mullen said.


 


Senior cornerback Taveze Calhoun says that one good season won’t change the mind of many of the Bulldogs’ skeptics. And he also isn’t quite sure what his team has to do to earn more respect.So in the mean time, the Bulldogs are just going to use the doubt as fuel, so they can propel themselves to the top of the SEC.“I don’t really know,” Calhoun said. ""We are just going to control things that we can control. We just have to try and be the best team we can be and be the best players we can be.”","Connor Riley

15-Jul-15,SEC Media Days: Kentucky and the quest for bowl eligibility,"HOOVER, Ala. -- The Kentucky Wildcats started last season with a 5-1 record and appeared destined to go to a bowl game for the first time since 2010. However, the team struggled down the stretch and lost their final six games. It was a disappointing end to a promising year, but Wildcats head coach Mark Stoops believes he has pinpointed what went wrong.“I really liked the way we played in the first six games,” Stoops said. “We have to learn now to be able to sustain that. We have to change some things in our development in the second part of the season in the way we train them and the way we practice, and we have to continue to breed that confidence.”Part of the hope for Kentucky lies in the drive of its players. Several Wildcats took it upon themselves to work together outside of mandatory workouts and practices, which created a ripple effect that drew in more players. The result is weight-room gatherings that mirror a team scrimmage.


 


“Everyone is working extremely hard,” senior defensive tackle Melvin Lewis said. “If you come after a workout session, you would think we're having practice out there by how many people are out there putting in the extra work. All of that is going to pay off.""The missed bowl appearance last season showed Stoops has made progress at Kentucky, but getting there in 2015 will be difficult.The Wildcats have changed offensive coordinators; Shannon Dawson comes in from West Virginia to replace new Troy head coach Neal Brown. The schedule does Kentucky no favors, as they play eight bowl bowl-eligible teams from one year ago. There remains uncertainty at quarterback between junior Patrick Towles and redshirt freshman Drew Barker, and the defense has shifted from a 4-3 scheme to a 3-4.A new defensive strategy isn’t even the biggest issue for the Wildcats. The team lost its two best pass-rushers from 2014 in Za’Darius Smith and Bud Dupree, who both graduated last year and are now in the NFL. Smith and Dupree combined for 12.0 sacks and 135 tackles for Kentucky, leaving a huge void for the current squad. If the Wildcats are going to pressure quarterbacks again, it will be with help from players like Lewis.Lewis acknowledges what Smith and Dupree brought each game but understands it’s up to himself and his fellow defensive players to step up to the task.“We just have to continue to bring the other guys along,” Lewis said. “For us older guys, we have to keep fine-tuning our technique. You can't replace those guys, but we'll be able to fill their spots.”Even if the Wildcats fail to reach a bowl game, the players indicate the program is moving in the right direction. Senior safety A.J. Stamps and senior offensive tackle Jordan Swindle stated the team chemistry was much better this year, displayed by the team’s voluntary workout habits. Swindle also pointed towards the improved speed both in the veterans and some of Stoops’ underclassmen. No one will hand the team six victories, but it has never been that way for Kentucky.Swindle is proud of the work of this group of players and feels like Stoops and the Wildcats are on the verge of something worthwhile.


 


""We're changing the team culture,"" Swindle said. ""Our chemistry has gotten a lot better and we're getting the point where everybody is buying in and everybody is going the extra mile. When you have that, I think that's the recipe for a successful team.""","Jordan D. Hill

15-Jul-15,Faculty and students reflect on the effect of marijuana policy on 2016 presidential election,"John F. Kennedy had Marilyn. Bill Clinton had Monica. Will the next president have Mary Jane?According to an article from Newsweek, the 2016 presidential election has been dubbed the ""marijuana election"" because more candidates are going to have to tackle the topic of marijuana and marijuana policy.When it comes to the public opinion, millennials lead the public with 68 percent of people from 18-24 favoring the legalization of marijuana. As far as the general population goes, 53 percent of people favor the legalization of marijuana overall, according to data from the Pew Research Center.


 


As of right now, marijuana policy is put into the hands of the state, not the national government. Each state varies on the legality or decriminalization of marijuana.For example, if you are above the age of 21 in Colorado, you can legally possess up to 1 oz. of marijuana as opposed to the state of Georgia where 1 oz. and anything below that is a misdemeanor.Georgia has only recently legalized medical marijuana. People with seizure disorders, multiple sclerosis and other illnesses are now able to use a non-smoking form of medical marijuana in Georgia.Valerie Martinez, an upcoming third year from Macon believes that since states like Georgia are now making changes in their marijuana policies, she thinks that it will be discussed more in this upcoming election.“It is definitely a bigger issue than before,” Martinez said. “I don’t think that it will be the biggest issue, but it will definitely be talked about more.”Paul-Henri Gurian, an associate professor from the Department of Political Science, specializes in areas such as campaign strategy and dynamics. He agrees with Martinez on how much marijuana will be a focus in this upcoming election.“I don’t believe that the upcoming campaign will focus on this issue, so I don’t think the campaign itself will make much difference concerning marijuana legalization,"" Gurian said.Moreover, Gurian believes that we probably won’t see the national legalization of marijuana in the United States for a long time.


 


“I don’t think that we’ll see anything like nation-wide legalization for a long time — I expect that many states will continue to keep it illegal.”Matt Mead, an upcoming third year from Dacula, brought up the recent national legalization of gay marriage and related it to the future of marijuana since gay marriage started out as being state regulated.“I think it will follow a similar trend to gay marriage in terms of legalization, where the majority of states will start the momentum and then federal law will deem it legal across the nation,"" Mead said.Martinez agrees with Mead on gay marriage acting as a precedent, and in the long run, she believes that we will see it become legalized on a national scale.“Look what happened with gay marriage: It was a topic of discussion in the last presidential election. Because of that, I think that we will probably see it in our lifetime,"" Martinez said.","Abby McHan

17-Jul-15,Top football recruits descend on Athens for Dawg Night,"The top recruits in the nation will flood Athens this weekend for Georgia football's annual Dawg Night.The weekend event gives high school players and recruits the opportunity to showcase their skills while learning techniques from Coach Mark Richt and his staff.As recruits gear up to train among the best, Georgia football gears up to continue the pursuit of a top recruiting class. Ranked No. 6 in the nation for recruiting, Georgia fans wait in anticipation as the event has turned into a breeding ground for verbal commits.


 


After last years camp landed Mark Richt and Co. four commitments, including 5-star recruits Ben Cleveland and five-star quarterback Jacob Eason, expectations for Georgia are at an all time high.Predicted to reach up to 125 attendees, Georgia Football seeks to top last year by focusing on the elite this weekend.

21-Jul-15,'Trainwreck' lives up to its name,"In my opinion, the highlight of Amy Schumer’s role in her film ""Trainwreck"" is her falling flat on her face. Apart from that, I’m not a fan. The trope of the washed up protagonist with an alcohol problem and a stagnant career works brilliantly for Bridesmaids, starring Kristen Wiig, but when Schumer does the same, it comes off as crass and abrasive and not in an endearing way.For the majority of the movie, I was skeptical that someone who wore such short skirts could realistically get and keep a job. I realize that the script is supposed to be a smart social commentary on dating and gender stereotypes, but in the end, Schumer just seems to imply that it’s socially acceptable to show up to a job that you don’t like hungover, unprepared and in inappropriate attire. Couldn’t she have been a tad more put together so that later in the movie when her love interest gives up on her, the audience would root for her, rather than feel getting rid of her was actually the best thing for his health and career?Don't agree?


 


Read a different take!Of course in the end they sail off into the sunset, or more accurately roll around on gym mats. By this point in the movie Schumer’s significantly more likeable, but I remained unconvinced of their romance because for an hour-and-a-half, I had been treated to Schumer careening around on screen in a drunken stupor.I’m not saying the movie isn’t funny, because it is. I laughed, not quite as much as the previews would suggest, but the film has its moments. The laughs were largely thanks to the supporting cast. It seems as though the other members of the cast are there to offset Schumer’s depravity. Bill Hader, who plays Schumer’s love interest, has more onscreen chemistry with LeBron James, who steals any scene he’s in. Therein lies the strength of the movie. The supporting actors such as James and Tilda Swinton deliver comedic performances that far outpace that those of the actual comedians cast in the film.The movie opens with a voice over of Schumer’s character Amy Townsend (clever name), narrating her drunken sexcapades with a slew of men. It’s supposed to be endearing and warm us to her debauchery, but she just comes off as an alcoholic sex addict. She lives by her father’s motto of “monogamy isn't realistic,” which leads to her breaking the heart of a very sensitive John Cena, another professional athlete who delivers a stellar comedic performance. Of course as the movie progresses and Amy meets her love interest, she cleans up her act a bit. However, for me, nothing she does can really reverse the impression that her character rolls out in the first half hour of the movie. I wish that Hollywood could find a female protagonist for romantic comedies who is neither a complete hot mess nor an ice queen.",Kimberlee John-Williams @redandblack,variety,https://www.redandblack.com/variety/trainwreck-lives-up-to-its-name/article_a3289230-2fce-11e5-af51-c3e6762c0558.html
21-Jul-15,Scouting Report: Deejay Dallas,"On Saturday, Mark Richt kept another star in state, as four-star athlete Deejay Dallas committed to the Bulldogs Saturday night at Dawg Night.Dallas, out of Glynn Academy in Brunswick, Georgia, becomes the Bulldogs’ second commitment for the class of 2017. He can play both wide receiver or lineup in the defensive backfield. Strengths: Dallas, at six-foot-one and 190 pounds, is a do-it-all athlete who can play both sides of the ball as well as return kicks. On his high school tape, every time he touches the ball good things seem to happen. Dallas lines up as a receiver often in the slot, often taking the handoff off of the read option. Dallas has great speed, good hands, and an awareness of where he needs to be to get extra yards.


 


Dallas is one of the players who is invaluable to his team and subsequently college coaches because he can do a little bit of everything. Dallas is also a disciplined defender with good vision. He stays with and shows opposing a bit of maturity in coverage that is beyond his high school years.Weaknesses: Dallas’s greatest strength may also be a weakness. Because he is so versatile, he has yet to focus or hone in on one position. While this is not uncommon for high school players, it will be something to monitor throughout his next two seasons at the high school level. It is not yet clear what position he will play in college, though Georgia indicates that they’d like him at defensive back or safety.Most of Dallas’s highlights came either on kick returns or as a receiver, and on defense it looked as though he relied on his receiver instincts to follow routes and knock down passes. If in fact Georgia wants him on defense, getting more reps in secondary will be necessary and also help Dallas improve his tackling. He certainly has the size to play defensive back; it’s just a matter of honing in on those skills if in fact that is where he will be placed.Take Away: This is a huge pickup for the Bulldogs as there has been mutual interest between the Dallas and Georgia for months, and the four-star recruit is one of the more talented players in the state. After lots of turnover and departures in the secondary over the past few years, the Bulldogs once again have talent on the back end led by the emerging Dominick Sanders and junior Quincy Mauger. While Dallas won’t arrive on campus for a few years, his speed and size will be another welcome addition to Bulldog secondary if that is in fact where he is slotted. With his talent, there’s no reason to believe he won’t succeed wherever he may play.","Evan Greenberg

23-Jul-15,Power Five conferences to see a raise in cost of attendance funding,"In January, the five wealthiest college sports conferences — the Southeastern, Pac-12, Big Ten, Atlantic Coast and Big 12 — better known as the Power Five, approved the decision to increase what they can offer in total scholarships to student athletes.Before the vote, the regular stipend to student-athletes included an easily quantifiable figure — tuition and fees, room and board, and books. But now, players can receive stipends that reflect the full cost of attendance, and cover a broader range of expenses such as transportation and miscellaneous personal expenses.Schools lobbied for a larger offering due to student-athletes’ demanding schedules. Their time commitment does not leave space for the part-time jobs available to other non-athlete classmates. NCAA restrictions also prohibit athletes from receiving any compensation for the money that they bring into the school.


 


Federal guidelines require all schools to publish cost of attendance figures — the totals that admissions offices cite and are published on College Navigator and other tools referenced by students applying to colleges. But exactly how the COA is calculated is left up to each school.It’s an issue of fairness, as the amount of money each school offers its student-athletes varies across the board, putting some schools at an advantage. The next phase of the cost of attendance saga features rules that require every school to submit the areas in which they distributed their stipend money each semester. The transparency in each school’s spending will allow understanding as to where the money is going and how it is being used.“We’ve understood cost of attendance awards can vary, and the methods used to calculate and arrive at those amounts can vary,” said SEC commissioner Greg Sankey last week at SEC Media Days. “It really is simply, from an intended standpoint, the ability for an institution to understand what goes into those numbers.”The estimated stipends of the 14 teams in the SEC range from $2,284 to $5,666 according to analyses published by media outlets including 247sports.com and The Chronicle of Higher Education. The $3,382 difference prompted debate about whether more generous calculations will give some schools an upper hand in recruiting and thus competition.The University of Tennessee used to provide $23,710 and after increasing this scholarship by $5,666 to include the new cost of attendance numbers, it now totals $29,376. This increase ranks No. 1 in the SEC while the University of Kentucky hit No. 14 with only a $2,284 increase.The bylaws from the NCAA were changed in January to include any “other expenses related to attendance at the institution up to the cost of attendance,” according to Jim Booz, senior associate athletic director for compliance.The Red & Black asked UGA Athletics how many athletes currently qualified but at this time the number varies until the fall semester begins. Back in April the Athens Banner-Herald reported 145 athletes had full scholarships and 225 had partials.“Not every student-athlete receives an athletic scholarship and most receive partial scholarships,” Booz said to The Red & Black. “Therefore, the amounts and application will vary based on an individual’s scholarship amount and the way in which the scholarship is to be applied to all of their costs of attendance — tuition and fees, room and board, books, other expenses related to the attendance.”


 


Regardless of the differences in numbers, the treatment of the student-athletes at Georgia has always been of high quality, according to head football coach, Mark Richt.“Anything we can do to bless these guys for what they’ve done for us, I’m all in,” Richt said at SEC Media Days. “I do believe, though, that how we treat our players at Georgia is the best we could possibly treat ‘em.  I do believe that the experience of getting their education at Georgia is a huge payment:  how we travel, where we stay, how we feed them, the training that they get in the strength and conditioning, the nutritionists, the sports psychologists, the coaching in itself.”The estimated numbers in cost of attendance are used in calculating financial aid for students so the rise may or may not affect everyone else because of how aid is calculated. The Red & Black tried to get in contact with the office of financial aid to get more information about how cost of attendance rising could affect students but they were unavaliable for a comment.When it comes to athletics, the need to compete with other schools to get the best recruits is an on-going issue. A school that offers more money can be a deciding factor for some perspective students, but the majority of the incoming freshmen recruits are not pre-occupied by the numbers.“I don’t know if [recruits] are quite aware because we don’t get a lot of questions about it,” said head basketball coach Mark Fox in an interview. “It’s an area that maybe more coaches are concerned about than prospects. Once they develop that awareness, I’m sure we’ll get more questions about just exactly how much we’ll provide and cost of attendance, and that you compare it to somebody else.”Georgia ranked at No. 13, second to last, in the estimated SEC stipends with $2,598 when the new figures  were first released but have since changed its cost of attendance numbers. Now for in-state it reaches $3,222. This moves them up to No. 9 just below the University of Florida at $3,320, using the numbers from 247sports.com.“Until we get to that [transparency], and how everybody figures it, there’s some significant difference,” Fox said. “Are they great enough to impact someone’s decision? Likely, they are. We haven’t quite crossed that bridge yet.”

23-Jul-15,Greece's impact on the US: Responding to the bailout,"The year 2001 marked Greece’s entrance into the eurozone and adoption of the euro. For a short period of time, their economy saw growth and improvement but after the financial crisis that shook the world in 2008, Greece has been forced to suffer.Last week, Greece and the eurozone made an agreement that will help pay back the high deficits that they have. For many Americans, thoughts turn to their home country and worry about its economic health in the future.The financial crisis of 2008 was one of the worst recessions in almost a century. To this day, many countries have still been unable to recover and reach the level of GDP that they had pre-crisis, two being Greece and the United States.


 


America’s GDP has always been one of the highest in the world at $17 trillion, according to the most recent report from the World Bank. Although America has never fully recovered from the financial crisis, it has always been able to support itself.Greece on the other hand has a GDP that lies around $237 billion, a debt to GDP ratio of 172 percent compared to America’s 105.06 percent debt to GDP ratio.Kim An Ta, a second year student from Clarkston, recently took a macroeconomics class where the Greek and American economies were discussed throughout the course.“In class, Greece was discussed in a rather negative light,"" Ta said. “It could very well be our good ol' American attitude that is causing us to point a finger at Greece as if it were some child that is sitting in timeout for taking too much out of the cookie jar, while as a nation, we are debtors ourselves.”According to Professor Bill Lastrapes in the Terry College of Business, running large debts is not as bad as it may seem for America.“There’s nothing fundamentally wrong with a deficit because you are simply borrowing,” Lastrapes said. “For the fiscal deficit, the U.S. government does have a lot of debt outstanding, but investors willingly hold it towards relatively low interest rates because they are confident that the U.S. will pay them back.”Both Lastrapes and Ta mentioned that since America is the most efficient and productive nation in the world, they can get away with running large deficits and having a lot of debt. Americans need not worry right now about how our economy is faring in relation to Greece’s.For the moment, I don't think we should be concerned about U.S. debt in the same sense that we are with Greece,” Ta said. “We should of course, still be concerned to some degree because the economy is rather unpredictable no matter how much theory we try to infuse into it.”


 


All hope is not lost for Greece though.“If Greece’s economy can get back on track and if their institutions improve so that they can benefit from international financial markets, then I think that there is the potential for Greece to be a productive member in Europe,” Lastrapes said.","Abby McHan

23-Jul-15,"On anniversary of ADA, enrollment among students with disabilities increasing","Students with disabilities have been a growing presence on college campuses over the past few years. This month marks the 25-year anniversary of the passage of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), a law passed by Congress allowing, among other things, individuals and students with physical or learning disabilities protection from discrimination and increased access to colleges and universities.The ADA was made effective July 26, 1990 during George H.W. Bush’s administration. Sen. Tom Harkin authored the bill, and delivered a portion of his own speech for the act in sign language.The act found that “historically, society has tended to isolate and segregate individuals with disabilities, and, despite some improvements, such forms of discrimination against individuals with disabilities continue to be a serious and pervasive social problem.”


 


Further, the act defines a disability as “a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities of such individual,” according to the text of the law.Learning disabilities an increasing presenceThe National Center for Learning Disabilities published a report last year that found 67 percent of young people with learning disabilities sought out and were enrolled in higher education after high school.Since 1990, there has been an 18 percent increase in students with learning disabilities being enrolled in post-secondary education across the nation, according to the same report. For perspective, the rate of enrollment among young adults without disabilities increased by only 9 percent in the same timespan.The Americans with Disabilities Act has thus enabled a subset of students to pursue their dreams and find support for their endeavors. Charles Bullock, a distinguished teaching professor in the Department of Political Science, said that he would not be surprised to see the number of enrolled students with learning disabilities continue to climb, especially with increased aid over the years.“Once you then make it so that there is some support [for students with disabilities], I would expect you would begin to see more students with disabilities apply,” Bullock said. “In any class I teach, where I usually have 80 students, I have 1 to 3 students who will take their test in the disabilities resource office.”With more and more enrolled students, colleges and universities around the nation have had to provide more services to accommodate their various needs. With changing times, online resources have also been subject to accessibility requirements.“The federal government doesn’t pay for all of the costs of it,” Bullock said. “A lot of it gets pushed down as an unfunded mandate to local or even state institutions to pay for.”


 


To support these students, the University of Georgia has a Disability Resource Center, where students who have learning disorders or physical disabilities can receive support. Support ranges anywhere from assistive listening devices, text services, captioned media, notetaking and more.The DRC was not available for comment due to the summer being their busiest time of year, dealing with an influx of new students to the University. Due to the nature of the center’s confidentiality guidelines, statistics on the number of students with disabilities currently attending UGA are difficult to obtain.UGA adapts to physical disabilitiesThe ADA also granted men and women with physical disabilities protection against discrimination. The effects of this on college students has been the building of ramps.Carden Wyckoff has been a vocal presence on-campus and off for the recognition and support of students with physical disabilities. Her own drive comes from a personal place.“I think at one point in my life, I wanted to just blend in,” Wyckoff said. “And then I realized I can’t blend in, I’m different.”Wyckoff and others helped create tangible change at the university during her time as a student.“We were strong advocates for making buildings, the Arch, and ramps accessible on-campus,” Wyckoff said. “I had about seven curb cuts installed around campus to allow wheelchair access on the sidewalk.”


TNCMS.AdManager.render({region: 'fixed-big-ad-bottom-asset', slot: 1, fold: ""below""});


Throughout all of her advocacy, Wyckoff said that the university was always welcoming to her ideas and those of others.“[UGA] has been awesome and very supportive,” Wyckoff said. “The process was I had to go to Leigh Jagor at the Disabilities Resource Center. She’s responsible for contacting facilities maintenance.”The maintenance department is then in charge of approving or denying the change, usually finding in favor of the student’s needs.“The [changes] that I put in, I feel like 9 out of 10 got approved,” Wyckoff said.President Obama remarked on the anniversary of the ADA from the White House Monday, praising the original act and speaking of the continuing need for support of individuals with disabilities.“The ADA offered millions of people the opportunity to earn a living and help support their families,” Obama said. “But we all know too many people with disabilities are still unemployed -- even though they can work, even though they want to work, even though they have so much to contribute.Wyckoff agreed that continuing to educate individuals about the realities of disabilities is key to ensuring help for individuals.“I think it’s important for students to open their eyes. We all have issues, so it’s important to be inclusive and understand what the DRC is. A lot of people know what the Career Center is, but not the DRC,” Wyckoff said.","Patrick Adcock

23-Jul-15,'Go Set a Watchman': A more true lesson in growing up,"Fifty-five years after the debut of Harper Lee’s critically-acclaimed “To Kill a Mockingbird,” Lee’s new and second-ever novel “Go Set A Watchman” has created controversy for one reason: Scout has returned as young woman to her hometown of Maycomb, Alabama, to discover that her beloved and heroic father Atticus Finch is a segregationist, attendee of KKK meetings and, ultimately, racist.As readers, we are dismayed at this revelation because we viewed Atticus Finch as a defender of human rights and character of indefatigable integrity. In middle school, I journeyed with Scout to learn that “our consciences shouldn’t abide by majority opinion” and that understanding people takes more empathy than imagined. It is through this book that I received part of my initial exposure to social justice and the law—and even briefly considered becoming a lawyer.However, “To Kill A Mockingbird” is the idealized world of when truth and justice prevails and bad men get what they deserve, but the full complexity and deep history of race has not been acknowledged. In a novel about race, the black characters support the white protagonists and don’t get the opportunity to tell their views.


 


Compared to the easy-to-digest message of “To Kill a Mockingbird,” Lee’s “Go Set a Watchman” portrays a messier, more realistic universe of the Deep South in the mid-twentieth century.In the novel, Scout experiences disillusionment with her origins with Atticus’s revelation. Although we should not assume that everything that happened to Scout in the first novel remained true in this one, Lee did write that the racist Atticus defended and acquitted a black man two decades earlier. Seeing the two highly contrasting perspectives of Atticus converge leaves readers’ stomachs churning.It is important to note that although “Go Set a Watchman” was published on July 14, 2015, it was written before “To Kill a Mockingbird,” which Lee wrote after developing her writing skills through workshops and criticism. Thus, this new novel is a prequel to Lee’s original bestseller.“To Kill a Mockingbird” is a better novel than “Go Set a Watchman” because of Lee’s captivating narration of Scout’s lost of childhood innocence, admirable characters, and haunting depiction of the best and worst qualities of the South.However, “Go Set a Watchman” is the more honest novel. If we evaluate racism in America through the conditions set by “To Kill a Mockingbird,” then racism is eliminated when we do not condemn innocent men to death because of their race. Through this new novel, we see that people like Atticus can remain good, ordinary folks who serve their communities and go to church—but live quietly with simmering prejudiced beliefs.Although “Go Set a Watchman” is not the endearing masterpiece that “To Kill a Mockingbird” is, it is more attuned to our growing unease of a post-racial society. The Atticus we have uncovered muddles our notions of right and wrong and forces us to reconsider that racism in America is not as clean-cut as we assume.- Ha Truong is a rising junior from Suwanee majoring in English and biology.","Ha Truong

24-Jul-15,Safe running destinations near Athens,"Athens is notorious for its’ downtown concrete jungle aesthetic. Along with the noisy bar scene and traffic, runners can be deterred. Although UGA’s campus has a few good running spots, hard surfaces can be tough on the body. Here are a few fresh places to jog in the Athens area that are both safe and soft onThe Cook’s Trail at Sandy Creek ParkLocated 10 minutes north of Athens, Cook’s Trail is a windy, flat 4.1 mile route. Since the ground is either boardwalk or dirt roads, it makes for a comfortable running surface. On a hot summer day, the refreshing breeze from the creek and foliage-covered pathway are a nice swap for the exposed city terrain.


 


North Oconee GreenwayOnly a five minutes’ drive away, a common destination for many in Athens is the Greenway. Despite the 3.75 miles of concrete road, it is shaded and offers more of a rural feel, and running on the grass sides helps to avoid shin splints.The beginning of the trail is the ending of Cook’s Trail, so for long training days, doubling up on mileage can amount to almost eight miles.Watson State Mill ParkWith over seven miles of paths available, the 20 minute drive is definitely worth the change in scenery. Once a spot intended for agricultural use, Watson Mill has become a perfect area for recreation. The shaded canopy throughout the trails and beautiful forest landscape offers a serene experience. After the run, wade into the creek’s rapids for a cool down and stretch.Oconee Forest Park (5 minutes)An extension of UGA, the Oconee Forest Park is located behind the Intramural Fields. This 60 acres of preserved land is home to nearly two miles of designated trails, a 100-year-old oak-hickory forest and Lake Herrick. Its close to campus and has a safe seclusion aspect.Even though most of these runs are a drive away, your body will thank you for the change of pace!

27-Jul-15,Scouting Report: Charlie Woerner,"The Bulldogs latest addition to their 2016 recruiting class might be their best skill player yet. Charlie Woerner is a 6-foot-5 230 pound offensive weapon. I say offensive weapon because at this point, he could play a variety of positions.Woerner is a highly-rated four star recruit who plays his high school football for Rabun County High School. This is an important piece to factor into how one views Woerner. Rabun County doesn’t compete with the Archer and Peachtree Ridge-type schools of the world. This often means that Woerner is far-and-away the best player on the field.But being so much better than everyone else on a high school field also has its drawbacks. Because he is so talented, his team constantly plays him out of position. While Woerner has the frame that screams tight end, he doesn’t play like it all the time. He actually may better suited as a wide receiver at the next level, something that he has expressed to UGA coaches.


 


Strengths: For someone of his size and build, Woerner has freakish athletic tools. Woerner’s most impressive trait is his ability to come to a stop, change direction, and then speed up to separate from defenders. His ability to cut on a dime would impress former USC tailback Reggie Bush.The other strength that Woerner possess is that he is more than capable of finishing a catch through contact. Woerner shows the ability to high-point the ball and finish the catch with defenders draped all over him.Woerner is a great athlete. At times Woerner doesn’t seem to be running hard. But his long strides, and acceleration and agility allow him to blow past defenders. He’s also not afraid to drop his shoulder and bowl over smaller defenders.Areas of Improvement: Woerner is without a doubt the best player on his team. Because of this, he will line up at tailback on numerous plays. While this allows Woerner to flash his athletic ability, it prevents him from taking snaps at a position, either tight end or receiver, he will play in college.His tape doesn’t show much in terms of route running, but with his ability to cut, he should eventually be fine. The biggest issue is that if he is going to play tight end at the next level, he has to get more physical as a blocker. What makes New England Patriots tight end Rob Gronkowski so great isn’t just his pass-catching talents. It is his ability to bully smaller linebackers and safeties in the running game.Woerner isn’t terrible at blocking, and if he plays wide receiver he won’t need to be as physical. Woerner also plays some defense for Rabun County, and he shows plenty of teams he has no qualms about laying someone out. At the next level, especially with the tailback talent Georgia attracts, he needs to just become a more physical blocker.Verdict: For a team with many questions at wide receiver, Woerner is a nice future player at the position. He’ll have the chance to play early and given offensive coordinator Brian Schottenheimer’s offensive creativity, Woerner could fill numerous roles on the Georgia offense.Woerner is more Jimmy Graham than Rob Gronkowski in terms of pass-catching tight ends. In all likelihood, he’ll end up playing on the outside more than he does with his hand in the dirt. If he refines himself as a route runner and settles in on one position, he could be a very reliable target for the Bulldogs.

31-Jul-15,Five fall album releases you should be anticipating,"This has been a great year for music so far. We’ve already received fantastic new records from artists such as Kendrick Lamar, Father John Misty, Björk and many others, but the year is only half over. The following list contains five albums that you shouldn’t let slip past you this fall — assuming they’re all released before 2016 rolls around.“Boys Don’t Cry” by Frank OceanFrank Ocean cemented himself a niche spot in the R&B/hip-hop world with his breakout debut studio album “Channel Orange” back in 2012. Since then, his features on tracks by Jay-Z, Kanye West and Tyler the Creator have only further pushed him into the public lexicon. 


 


He teased fans with a snippet of a song called “Memrise” on his Tumblr page on April of this year, and rumor has it that he will drop an album titled “Boys Don’t Cry” before the year ends.  His varied sound bounces from sounding like Marvin Gaye and Stevie Wonder, to crooning with ambient psychedelic rock to jamming on bombastic funk without ever coming across as out of place or overly ambitious. Few artists sound anything like Ocean — the closest peer to the singer’s sound would probably be The Weeknd, whose singles have been tearing up the charts recently. Hopefully, Ocean’s new project will yield similar results. “Meow the Jewels” and “Run The Jewels 3” by Run The JewelsAtlanta rapper Killer Mike and New York producer/emcee El-P struck gold when they collaborated in 2013 under the Run The Jewels moniker. The duo release hard-hitting, unapologetic bangers where each new one-liner assaults the listener more than the last. To the group, rap is a stick up, and the duo is taking the jewels one way or another.After two critically acclaimed albums, “Run the Jewels 3” is set to release right at the end of 2015 or in early 2016. In case it doesn’t drop in time though, a new mixtape titled “Meow the Jewels,” filled with cat-sound coated remixes, should scratch that itch until the studio album’s release. Just update your life insurance policy ahead of time, and maybe your cat’s too. Album with title TBA by ToolFor those that need a bit more of a heavier fix, look no further than Tool, the progressive metal giants. The band went on hiatus in 2008 after the release of “10,000 Days” in 2006—whose lead single “Vicarious” absolutely tortured players of the game “Guitar Hero World Tour” back in middle school.Tool’s music often features downright unnatural time signatures that amazingly remain melodic and accessible even to those that can’t tell the difference between 4/4 and 13/16. While the band’s upcoming project remains untitled, guitarist Adam Jones said he hoped the album would be out before 2015 ends, but emphasized that it would not be rushed to meet any deadlines.


 


Fans have waited patiently for almost a decade for a new Tool record, and hopefully the band can deliver before the waiting time turns into a literal decade. After all, the band definitely knows how to count.“Radio Silence” by James BlakeJames Blake comes from a background of producing British electronic and wonky music, but he has made huge waves in the singer-songwriter category since his debut album in 2011.His 2013 follow up, titled, “Overgrown” earned him his first Grammy nomination. Blake’s mash-up of soul and electronic elements may seem jarring or perplexing to some, but it creates an atmosphere and identity unlike anything else. Some moments from “Overgrown”—namely “Take a Fall for Me,” which features rapper RZA, sound like they could’ve easily been incorporated on a Kanye West record.Coincidentally enough, both Kanye West and Bon Iver—also featured frequently on Kanye’s albums—are confirmed to have guest spots on his upcoming album.Album with title TBA by GrimesClaire Boucher—under her stage name Grimes—is a Canadian experimental electronic artist. Her songs sound like the twisted lovechild of Björk, ABBA, Aphex Twins and sometimes Alvin and the Chipmunks.Grimes’ electronic beats create a dreamy, wondrous atmosphere while her pitch-shifted vocals are slathered in so much reverb that they more closely resemble an instrument themselves as opposed to traditional vocals. The lyrics are almost unintelligible, but the music clutches to an undeniable atmosphere and mood.


TNCMS.AdManager.render({region: 'fixed-big-ad-bottom-asset', slot: 1, fold: ""below""});


The experience of listening to a Grimes record is actually very similar to listening to a J-pop record; the sound is certainly bubbly and infectious, but I don’t speak Japanese, or reverb-soaked chipmunk for that matter.The songwriter has stated that this album will be a surprise release sometime in October and will sound more like non-synthetic instrumentation, which may be reason for those turned off by her previous works to give her a second chance.",Zach Hansen @zach_ehansen,variety,https://www.redandblack.com/variety/music/five-fall-album-releases-you-should-be-anticipating/article_a628f804-371b-11e5-94b7-7b04698e60b6.html
14-Aug-15,Football notebook: Richt assesses the team following Friday's scrimmage,"Georgia football had its preseason scrimmage in Athens on Friday, just three days before classes kick off for players and students.Richt said the first and second teams ran between 50 and 60 plays, while the third team got about 32 plays - more reps than the third team usually gets.The format of the scrimmage was eight-play drives from the 30, then 45, following a one-minute drill at the end of the half, which Richt said the defense dominated. The first and second teams took a couple hail mary shots that were all defended, and the offense was able to convert on the majority of the 3rd and short attempts.


 


“We went to third and medium and that’s when the offense started to spark up and little bit,” Richt said. “The offense started making plays and actually had a few long touchdowns on the third-and-medium and third-and-long shots”On the two red zone drive simulations, the offensive units scored both times, but on the goalline the defense got the best of the offense particularly running the ball.QB, QB, who?Richt has said this offseason that the competition for the quarterback position will likely be stretched out even as far as the Louisiana-Monroe game. Nonetheless, Richt still picked up on technical issues his quarterbacks were experiencing.“The short to intermediate passing and catching is just not up to the standard that it needs to be on a consistent basis,” Richt said. “There were a couple calls, as far as changing protection that weren’t great and probably caused a sack.”Richt said that, as a whole, the timing on the deep ball has been improving and there were results shown in the scrimmage on Friday.“I think all of them had bright moments,” Richt said. “We threw the deep ball better today than we have all camp. Everyone of them had a deep ball throw that was either on the money or had a long gain.”No one but the Georgia coaching staff knows who is winning the battle in the offensive backfield, but Richt said they likely wouldn’t even narrow the race down to just two players anytime soon. For now, Richt is preaching patience and trust that he and his staff will find the right man.


 


“There’s a method to the madness here,” RIcht said. “It’s important because we’re the ones who watch the film and we’re the ones who decide who will start...right now it’s been very equal as far as reps, and there hasn’t been a huge landslide of guys running away with it.”Catching fireGeorgia’s receiving core is one of the most inexperienced position groups on Georgia’s offense early in the season, and there is certainly some roster combing left to do for the coaching staff to find a handful of viable, reliable players who can step up.Richt mentioned struggles catching short to medium passes in traffic during Friday’s scrimmage, but didn’t wait to mention there were a couple players that stuck out to him, and there were a healthy amount of good plays from the wideouts.“It wasn’t just one guy catching deep balls,” Richt said. “We had some ups and downs catching the ball as a unit...we did have some nice plays from the receivers for sure.”Kubla-know your techniqueThere isn’t a huge technical discrepancy between a shotgun snap and actually passing the ball, but unfortunately junior center Brandon Kublanow has had some trouble with both.“Kublanow snaps under center, but the shotgun snap has been rough on him,” RIcht said. “I don’t know that he ever learned how to throw a football quite frankly. Most snappers snap it like a passer would, he was struggling doing that because he can’t pass it good I think.”


TNCMS.AdManager.render({region: 'fixed-big-ad-bottom-asset', slot: 1, fold: ""below""});


Not to fear, however, the junior lineman has come up with a loophole that Richt says seems to be getting better results.“He showed us a new technique that’s been working for him,” Richt said. “Some people use it across the country, where you grab the nose of the ball and snap it end-over-end sort of like a punter.”Richt said the quarterbacks haven’t been having trouble catching the ball, and there isn’t any unnecessary wrist action that might cause the ball to sail, resulting in a bad snap.","Taylor Denman

17-Aug-15,Athens police releases video of officer beating drunk UGA student,"Athens-Clarke County Police have released the body camera footage of a police officer striking an intoxicated University of Georgia student repeatedly with a baton.Jonathan Fraser, a 17-year veteran officer with the Athens-Clarke County police, was fired July 3 after an internal investigation concluded that he used excessive force in arresting 19-year-old student Michael Roquet during an incident early in the morning on June 13.“This kind of action, of course, is not going to be tolerated by the Athens-Clarke County police department,"" said ACC Police Chief Scott Freeman. ""And I have to say this - and I keep re-iterating this - this is not typical for an Athens-Clarke County police officer. It is very embarrassing for the police department, but we are taking ownership of it because this is not who we are as an agency.”


 


The video, posted on YouTube on Aug. 15, shows Fraser responding to a call around 5 a.m. of an intoxicated person trespassing at the Marriott Courtyard in downtown Athens.The trespasser, Roquet, repeatedly mentions living at the hotel for years, while Fraser commands him to leave.The officer leads Roquet to a parking lot near the Phi Kappa Tau fraternity house on West Broad Street and threatens to take him to jail if he does not go inside.“I have to go back to work, and you’re wasting my time,” Fraser says in the video.Roquet does not go inside, and Fraser grabs the student's arm and tells him to put his hands behind his back. The video shows Roquet breaking free of the hold and walking toward the house, at which point Fraser grabs him from behind and sprays him with pepper spray.Fraser’s report later states that Roquet hit him in the chest with an elbow, though the body camera footage does not capture that.Roquet continues to the door of the house, appearing to try to type in an entrance code, when Fraser draws his baton and tries to insert it between Roquet’s arm and body to complete a take-down maneuver.Fraser then hits Roquet four times before Roquet sits down on the ground. The officer hits the student again, at which point he seems to comply with Fraser’s orders to get on the ground and put his hands behind his back.


 


Roquet cries out in pain after Fraser hits him two more times.Freeman said he chose to release the video to public, rather than try to cover the incident up.“It was an easy decision, because the video shows exactly what happened,"" Freeman said. ""In the spirit of transparency with the community, I released that video because I do not condone the actions of former officer Fraser, and it’s not something that we’re going to hide. We’re going to demonstrate to the public that we are open to transparency.”Fraser claimed that Roquet had struck him, justifying his use of force, but the video did not show this. Fraser was later fired.He defended hitting Roquet while the student was on the ground, stating that he was “tunnel visioned” and “knows he is out of shape,” according to police documents.The officer also violated department police protocol by not calling for medical attention after striking Roquet in the head. A nurse at the jail told investigators that Roquet had two knots on his head from being hit with a baton.Roquet later told investigators that he went to a hospital after getting out of jail and found he had suffered a concussion and a swollen ear.Freeman took on the position of police chief July 6, three days after Fraser was fired. He said ACC officers are trained to de-escalate situations, rather than use excessive force, as Fraser did.

""So I think we are going to continue to do what has been done,"" Freeman said. ""The officers are going to be trained the way they have been, and when they don’t adhere to that training, they will be disciplined accordingly, all the way up to and including termination.” Another surveillance video from a camera at the fraternity house was retrieved by the Georgia Bureau of Investigation and has not been released yet.

18-Aug-15,"UGA practice report: McKenzie returns to practice, Lambert paired with Mitchell in drills","The Georgia football team practiced on a rain-soaked Tuesday afternoon, and the media was allowed 15 minutes of observation time. Here are some observations as made by The Red & Black.Senior wide receiver Justin Scott-Wesley was not present during Georgia’s practice Tuesday. He slipped Monday while running a corner route, and he appeared to injure his right leg. His status is unknown, as the program has yet to release any official information regarding the nature of Scott-Wesley’s injury.Junior inside linebacker Tim Kimbrough did not participate in practice. Redshirt sophomore cornerback Aaron Davis was sporting a green non-contact jersey, but he still participated in some light catching drills.Davin Bellamy, a redshirt sophomore outside linebacker, participated in practice but his right hand was heavily wrapped and taped. The linebackers all ran a drill where they swung and hit a pad, so Bellamy’s hand stuck out. Bellamy seemed able to run that particular drill without any issues.Junior wide receiver Charlie Hegedus was also in a green shirt, but fortunately for the Bulldogs, sophomore wide receiver Isaiah McKenzie returned to the field after missing a few days. He participated in all the wide receiver drills, and showed no signs of any injury.The quarterbacks and wide receivers ran a variety of drills during the media’s observation period. It appeared that junior Greyson Lambert got most of the first-team reps, as he mainly threw to senior wide receiver Malcolm Mitchell. After running some quick routes, the receivers broke off and worked on staying low, as they each ran under a hurdle. After a few minutes of that, though, the receivers paired up with the quarterbacks again and caught some back-shoulder throws from the quarterbacks. Next, they ran some more complicated routes that involved a few cuts. Many receivers dropped passes because they were wet from the heavy rainfall, but junior Clay Johnson ran a nice route and completed the play. He drew applause from several of the coaches on the field.The quarterbacks worked on roll-out plays to the sideline, and Lambert again threw to Mitchell, and offensive coordinator Brian Schottenheimer made sure to let it be known, as he yelled loudly, “Greyson, you’ve got Malcolm.” The duo connected on a nice throw that had some zip on it. Junior Faton Bauta mainly threw to freshman Terry Godwin while redshirt sophomore Brice Ramsey worked with sophomore Shakenneth Williams.Georgia’s running backs got some practice in the passing game. Each tailback lined up outside and ran quick-in routes. Sophomore Sony Michel seemed to be the first-team option for that particular drill, and he caught a pass from Lambert. Senior Keith Marshall dropped a pass that hit him right in the hands, but it appeared to be because the ball was wet. The same thing happened to Nick Chubb. Before the passing drills, the running backs worked primarily on taking hand-offs from the quarterbacks.The defensive linemen and linebackers worked what coach Terry Rocker called a “power drill.” Essentially, one player lined up in front of another. After a simulated snap, one lineman rushed the other while the other worked as an offensive linemen. The goal of the drill was to improve each lineman’s edge rushing ability.

20-Aug-15,Recruiting Roundup: Eason begins for senior season,"This is the week one recruiting roundup, where our writers preview the week's high school games and follow Georgia commits and potential recruits.Julian Rochester, a 6-foot-6, four-star defensive tackle, anchors the McEachern High School defensive line as it opens its season against Tucker High School at the Georgia Dome on Aug. 22. Rochester has been committed to the Bulldogs since late May and is ranked by ESPN as the third best player in the state.Three-star guard and Georgia target Treymayne Anchrum will also suit up for McEachern. 247Sports.com has Anchrum split 50-50 between Southern California and Georgia. Anchrum sits at 6-foot-3 and 268 pounds.


 


Charlie Woerner’s commitment to Georgia was met with large fanfare — and for good reason. In addition to being related to Georgia football royalty, Woerner, out of Rabun County High School, clocks in at an impressive 6-foot-5, 220 pounds. Woerner and the Wildcats host Jefferson High School in a non-region game Aug. 21. Woerner is by far the star on his team and all eyes will be on him this season after his commitment.Chauncey Manac stands at 6-foot-3, 245 pounds. The defensive end is a four-star out of Clinch County High School and has been committed to the Bulldogs for almost a year. His Panthers open the year on the road against Calhoun County.Ben Cleveland and Jacob Eason, who became fast friends when paired together at Georgia camps, are paired together here as they often will be over the next few years. Cleveland will be charged with protecting the future Georgia quarterback. Both players also are idle this week. Cleveland and Eason’s  seasons get underway later this month for the former and at the beginning of September for the latter. Eason plans to sign his financial aid paperwork to early enroll at UGA in January on Friday.","Evan Greenberg

25-Aug-15,'Created Equal' film series continues ongoing civil rights discussion,"The United States celebrated the 50th anniversary of the Voting Rights Act on Aug. 6. The landmark legislation was enacted during the height of the Civil Rights Movement, but some say civil rights are still a prevalent issue.“This is an important topic within our community and within our country. The Civil Rights Movement is ongoing,” said Katherine Crapo, program coordinator for the Osher Lifelong Learning Institute at the University of Georgia.To preserve the history of the Civil Rights Movement, the Osher Lifelong Learning Institute will offer a four-film series called “Created Equal,” hosted at the Athens-Clarke County Library. After each screening, a UGA professor will lead a discussion about the film and the topics it covered.


 


“Our goal is to help continue the conversation on the long Civil Rights Movement. Athens has a rich history, amazing stories and amazing people,” Crapo said.The first film, “The Abolitionists,” was shown less than two weeks ago. The three-hour movie reenacts the stories of five leaders who fought to end slavery, including William Lloyd Garrison, Frederick Douglass and Harriet Beecher Stowe. About 40 people attended the screening, a number The Osher Lifelong Learning Institute hopes to increase for the next three films.“The discussion was excellent. There was a lot of thoughtful conversation among participants and tremendous interest in the remaining three films,” Krapo said.Many UGA students are passionate about the Civil Rights Movement and commend the “Created Equal” film series.“I think it is crucial that a dialogue on civil rights continue in this country, and I applaud the efforts of this series in facilitating that,” said Ryan Jones, a sophomore political science and sociology major from Clarksville, Tennessee.Jones said he feels conversations should include reflection on the country’s civil rights history, how much progress has been made and how much progress is yet to be made.“The tragedies you see on the news from Tamir Rice to Michael Brown to Eric Garner to Freddie Gray are not a string of isolated incidents,” Jones said. “Rather, they are a reminder of the sharp discrimination black Americans face at the hands of law enforcement.” Many students believe discrimination and racism still exist and want this to change.


 


“We didn’t leave all of that back in the ’60s. The issue still presents itself in many ways,” said Mary Beth Garrett, a sophomore photography major from Columbus.The festival’s three remaining films aim to continue these conversations. The second film, “Slavery by Another Name,” is a documentary based on Douglas Blackmon’s Pulitzer Prize-winning book of the same name. Showing this weekend, the movie will look into the labor system that forced Southern black males to be sold into unpaid work. The film contains interviews with the descendants of victims who were abused and exposed to deadly working conditions. Blackmon himself will lead the discussion.The third documentary, “Freedom Riders,” will show Sept. 12. The film highlights the 1961 Freedom Rides, where white and black activists encountered violence while riding buses throughout the Deep South, testing a Supreme Court ruling that desegregated buses. UGA English professor and co-director of the Civil Rights Digital Library, Barbara McCaskill, will lead the post-screening discussion.The final film, “The Loving Story,” documents interviews with Mildred and Richard Loving who were arrested for being an interracial married couple. The Supreme Court battle that ensued overturned laws banning interracial marriages. Dr. Robert Pratt, history professor and writer on the case, will lead the Oct. 12 discussion, closing out the festival with a conversation aimed at addressing civil rights issues.“We will be unable to make positive changes if people are not aware of the severity of the problem,” Garrett said.",Kalli Drake @kalliausten,variety,https://www.redandblack.com/variety/created-equal-film-series-continues-ongoing-civil-rights-discussion/article_af00d258-4b43-11e5-b6c8-77ee45878b70.html
26-Aug-15,SEC announces new medical observation procedure,"Potential injuries to the head or neck during Southeastern Conference football games will now be monitored through an instant replay process with the ability to communicate to on-field medical staffs in order to aid them in the identification of specific injuries.This NCAA rule was enacted by the SEC and the Big Ten Conference and will be implemented for the first time during the season opening games on Sept. 3. “The medical observer is a new effort intended to further enhance the support of student-athletes’ well-being,” SEC commissioner Greg Sankey said. “The observer will provide another set of eyes watching the field from a different perspective and providing a complement to the outstanding athletic medicine staffs already employed by our institutions.”


 


A qualified medical professional will be positioned in the replay booth having video and communications equipment at their expense. This new football observer program plans to function at all conference and nonconference league play. In addition, neutral site facilities will also partake in this new program and non- conference institutions that compete at an SEC home site will have the opportunity to opt in this program.Seen as a way to preserve time, the medical observer will be able to tell if the player is displaying instability or any inclusive signs that the player is capable of remaining in the game or not.However, there are two steps that must occur if the player stays in the game: (1) Alert the replay officials immediately and identify the player by his team and number on his jersey; (2) the medical staff must also be notified to watch the player and recommend that they may need a stoppage and medical assistance.If the player appears to be in severe condition then the medical observer will alert the referee though the wireless communication system. The referee then complies to NCAA regulations to stop the game and follow medical procedures as outlined in Rule 3 of the NCAA playing rules. Furthermore, the head coach of the respective team the player is on will be notified as well. The referee will announce: “Time Out . . . Medical Stop.” But the referee will do so without naming the player who is being removed from the game.","Jake Stansell

31-Aug-15,Athletic association board approves motion to move forward with indoor facility,"The Georgia Athletic Association Board of Directors approved a motion to move forward with the development of an indoor practice facility adjacent to Butts-Mehre Heritage Hall.The building will be approximately 80 yards wide, 140 yard long and 65 feet high from the interior, 75 feet for the exterior.The approximate time of completion will be determined after officials meet with the construction management firm. 


 


President Jere Morehead said the date for the project to commence is still to be determined, and athletic director Greg McGarity said there will be more visual information available as the project moves forward. ""The purpose of today is to take that next step and move forward with our approval,"" McGarity said. ""Then we can begin sharing information with our donors and sharing information with our recruits and getting off to a start prior to our September board meeting when we will have photographs and renderings.""The facility will be partially funded by Georgia's athletics department, and the other half is funded by private donors.""The proposed project budget for this facility is $30.2 million,"" board Treasurer Ryan Nesbit said. ""There is $15.1 million in UGA athletic association cash reserves and 15.1 million in private gifts to the UGA Athletic Association.""Nesbit said the the cash reserves would prevent the construction of the facility from being held back by the possibility of slow fundraising. McGarity said that the efficiency in raising the $15.1 million in donations is crucial since there are other facilities that will also need enhancements, and donations free up the reserves that would allow these renovations to commence. The facility will be made available to all athletic programs, including cages for softball and baseball and a 60-meter section of track for track and field events.Georgia is the final team in the Southeastern Conference to build an indoor facility after Florida made theirs open this offseason. The next step is a motion and approval from the Board of Regents, which will meet in September.

1-Sep-15,"UGA practice report: Reggie Carter missing again, QBs get security and defense looks sharp","Injury updateThere was still no sign of junior inside linebacker Reggie Carter. Carter missed Monday's practice after practicing last week. He also missed a few practices prior to last week as well. Quarterback security, and hand-offs


 


Georgia’s quarterbacks began the media observation period running drills that seemed intent on improving their ball security. Each quarterback took a simulated snap then did a five-step drop back. They then shuffled forward through a line of coaches and other quarterbacks who all tried to knock the ball out of their hands. No quarterback dropped the ball. Junior Greyson Lambert, who was named the starting quarterback for Georgia’s season opener against Louisiana-Monroe, ran the drill first, followed by redshirt sophomore Brice Ramsey and junior Faton Bauta.The only work the quarterbacks got with the Bulldogs’ tailbacks came via hand-off drills. The players lined up in an offset I-formation. Lambert ran the drill first with senior fullback Quayvon Hicks and sophomore running back Nick Chubb behind him. Bauta ran the drill with the second team and Ramsey worked it with the third team. That seemed to be the order of things Monday – Lambert got all the first-team reps while Bauta and Ramsey took turns working with the second and third teams.The Bulldogs’ tight ends caught some passes from the quarterback, with sophomore Jeb Blazevich and senior Jay Rome taking turns with the first team. Lambert only had one bad throw the entire 15-minute period, and it came on a pass that sailed over Blazevich’s head. Following the drills with the tight ends, the quarterbacks threw to the wide receivers. Senior Malcolm Mitchell had arguably the best catch of the day right as the media observation period expired. Mitchell had to jump and, in mid-air twisted to catch the ball. He crashed to the ground and rolled, but he didn’t drop the ball. Senior Justin Scott-Wesley, who’s been working as a coach since injuring his right knee a couple weeks ago, cheered for Mitchell after the catch. Mitchell didn’t seem hurt after the play.Defense looking sharpJunior linebacker Leonard Floyd practiced with the inside linebackers on Tuesday. The rest of the defense hit the basics hard.Blocking, blocking, and more blocking. Oh, and a some catching. That's what defensive coordinator Jeremy Pruitt had the secondary working on in Tuesday's practice. The first drill observed by the secondary was one where the group worked in pairs and had to shuffle in a lateral motion while blocking their partner. Then the group did another blocking drill. They worked in pairs again except this time the drill consisted of blocking while avoiding a low tackle, below the knees. After this drill the secondary worked on defending the pass, by defending their partner, who played the role of a receiver, then going up for the catch. The group did relatively well with this drill, with only two passes not being caught. Next up, was a drill where they blocked the a tackle sled then ran back to catch an over the should pass. They did this drill from the left ad right side. The defensive linemen were doing their usual drills with the pads and exercise ball where they run over the pads while catching a football. It was a rapid fire drill. Then They had to shuffle over two pads before returning to their starting spot while avoiding an exercise ball that was thrown at their feet.","Charlette Hall and Justin Hubbard

1-Sep-15,Duke University summer reading controversy unexpectedly unites students,"Each year, Duke University recommends a book for the incoming class to read. For the Class of 2019, the selected book was “Fun Home,” an autobiographical graphic novel and self-declared “family tragicomic,” by Alison Bechdel. The graphic novel features characters who identify with the LGBTQIA+ community, deal with mental health problems and encounter ordinary, day-to-day problems. However, some Duke students were dissatisfied with the recommendation, so they refused to read the novel, claiming that reading “Fun Home” compromised their morals. I respect others’ morals, but I believe these students were misguided in their noncompliance.The purpose of the summer reading program, according to Duke’s website (today.duke.edu/2015/04/summerreading2019) is to “give incoming students a shared intellectual experience with other members of their class.” Sociologically, the program is designed to build solidarity among the incoming class; that is, the program aims to unite students by providing a commonality for students to discuss. In some students’ refusal to read “Fun Home,” it may seem that there is a dysfunction in the summer reading program and, consequently, the solidarity. I argue the opposite. The students who, for moral reasons, deliberately chose not to read the suggested graphic novel united to create solidarity––even though it is not the solidarity the University initially hoped for. In this respect, the summer reading program achieved its primary goal: it built solidarity by stimulating conversations among Duke students, and greater society, about “Fun Home.” The students took a stand for that which they believe in, and that is truly great, but so is open-mindedness.When I heard about the controversy surrounding Duke’s summer reading program, I was intrigued; I had to know more. I needed to know why this novel, recounting the events of the author’s life in a factual biography, outraged so many individuals. So, I did what any person would do: I downloaded the eBook onto my phone and read it obsessively until I finished it a few hours later.


 


I wanted to believe the graphic novel was perfect and  everyone was just overreacting about it. I wanted to like everything about “Fun Home.” Rather, I found myself saddened by the stereotypical representations of gay people. The father was keen on home decor; the daughter described herself as “butch.” I wanted to hate this about the novel because it seemed to conform to society’s ideas about people, which could solidify the idea that all members of the LGBTQIA+ community are the same stereotypical individuals. But then, in the midst of my frustration, I remembered that it is an autobiography, and it is okay that some people do fit stereotypes. However, the author, as an advocate for the LGBTQIA+ community, could have emphasized that not all gay people fit the stereotypes as she and her father did.The events that occur within this novel are real––whether or not students agree with them––it is autobiographical. This book, albeit a graphic novel, discusses events that happen in the world in which we live. “Fun Home” highlights mental health problems such as anxiety and obsessive-compulsive disorder and acknowledges that they are real problems (which many individuals and books do not). The graphic novel simultaneously exposes readers to issues that members of the LGBTQIA+ communities face. College is about learning––and not simply in the classroom, it is about broadening horizons. Regardless of one’s upbringing, it is essential to learn about how other people live. We must learn to adapt, to be tolerant, to cohabitate the world and to help one another. Diversity enriches society. It is pivotal that we accept and respect all people. The world is not a vacuum; we cannot transform it into one.- Katie Davis is a senior from North Carolina majoring in philosophy and sociologyOpinions expressed in The Red & Black are the opinions of the writers and not necessarily those of The Red & Black Publishing Co., Inc.

3-Sep-15,"Even after ban, ticket fiasco reveals loyalty issues","Every year, in the dying days of summer, students at The University of Georgia can rush online to request tickets to Georgia football games. And while the website warns students that not all tickets are guaranteed, the expectation persists that most will win tickets to all seven home games. This year was different. Safety concerns from last year forced the UGA Athletic Association to take 20 percent of home ticket package recipients and send them through a lottery, leaving them with only six of the seven home games, missing either South Carolina or Alabama.Normally, as soon as tickets get released, students flood to Facebook pages, selling their home tickets those who didn’t get a package or trading away tickets. But this year, the market has grown. Not only are there those that didn’t receive a package, there are now those that didn’t receive the complete package.


 


Here’s where the first issue comes in. The Athletic Association decided to split tickets between South Carolina and Alabama. Now, while South Carolina may be our first SEC game of the season, Alabama is the game we have been waiting for. The Crimson Tide, in between the hedges. A rematch of the 2012 SEC championship. A game like that is a potentially priceless college memory.Before ticket transfers for South Carolina and Alabama were banned, students were taking advantage of the lack of Alabama tickets online, scalping fellow students for over $200 for a ticket that they bought for $8.Yes, scalping is legal in Georgia, but is it right? As the initial deals stalled on Facebook groups, waiting for the ticket donation website to go live, the average offering price for Alabama tickets resting at 25 times original purchase price, the discussion turned from ‘How much do you want for your ticket?’ to ‘How could you possibly be so greedy as to charge a fellow poor college student $200 for a football ticket?’ And the discussion appeared to be split down the middle.Some students sided with morals, others sided with economics. One person would throw out a student loan sob story, and another would respond with a supply-and-demand chart and a shrug.Is it fair that a student can use their student benefits to get tickets for next-to-nothing with the intention of just reselling them for a profit?Now that transfers for the two games have been banned, it seems that the complicated answer, depending mostly on an individual standpoint has been decided for us. But this decision to stop ticket scalping now directs attention to the issues within the Georgia football ticket process itself.Students at Georgia have an amazing deal that they can either take advantage of or abuse. At Georgia, students can pay $63 and be awarded tickets to seven games in Sanford Stadium. That’s $8 a ticket, whether it’s an SEC matchup against Alabama or a non-conference game against Southern University. That’s seven games, likely at least four wins and over twenty-one hours of school spirit with 92,000 fellow members of the Bulldawg Nation for a quarter of the price of your chemistry textbook. And with general admission in the student section, if you get in line early, you can be in the front row, the hedges just an arm’s-reach away.At Alabama, things work a bit differently. Home games are broken into two packages. Two SEC games and two non-conference games for $40, or the other two SEC games and other non-conference game for $30. Students can then add expensive tickets in addition at $45 to $75 to the other home games. 


 


South Carolina students have even less certainty about getting football tickets. Rather than receiving packages, every week students must request tickets to that week’s home game. Applicants are then sorted based on loyalty points acquired from attending other sporting events. If they don’t claim them within the following two days, at which point those tickets are put back into a first-come, first-serve lottery.At Georgia, there is no loyalty filter surrounding ticket sales, like there is at South Carolina and a cheap all-inclusive package allows students to get seven games for less than half the market price of a single non-student ticket. So perhaps Georgia needs to start enacting some extra measures to ensure that those that are buying tickets to the games intend on going to the game, rather than acquiring a valuable resale item. A loyalty program, where those who go to the games have a higher chance of getting tickets in the future. Replacing an all-inclusive package with smaller packages or a la carte purchases, so only students who want to go to a particular game get tickets for that game. It just might save students in the future from having to decide between this month’s rent and a ticket to Alabama.-Nate Harris on behalf of the editorial board of the Red & Black","Nate Harris

3-Sep-15,Straight outta Cyprus: Kyprianou and Kallenou brought together by former personal coach,"It all started with a high jump pit on the island of Cyprus.  20 years ago, Georgia track coach Petros Kyprianou graced the pit under the direction personal coach Luke Kalogirou. Kalogirou helped Kyprianou with his technique in the high jump throughout the mid-1990s.As a result, a relationship blossomed.


 


“He was a decathlete and he coached me a little bit in the high jump,” Kyprianou said. “I was always respectful to him and had good relationships. He always developed and trained good jumpers and decathletes in Cyprus.”Five years ago, Kalogirou introduced him to another star athlete from Cyprus. This athlete happened to be Georgia three-time NCAA individual champion Leontia Kallenou. Kalogirou was Kallenou personal coach.  He had her practicing at the same high jump pit that Kyprianou had used as an athlete. Kallenou was coming off a 2011 gold medal at the Common Wealth Games at the Isles of Man. She posted a 6 foot high jump score and Kyprianou decided to check out the future star.“He put in a good word for me,” Kyprianou said. “She was an up and coming talent in Cyprus and I saw her marks and called up.  They gave us a visit and she chose Georgia.”The decision was an easy choice for Kallenou. Moving to a new country was going to be difficult, but she felt assured with Kyprianou as her new coach.“Having someone that speaks the same language, at the point where I couldn’t really speak English was important to me,” Kallenou said.” “When I came and visited the university, it was the only one that I really liked. I didn’t see anything bad about it. I liked the campus and the people.  The weather was very similar to Cyprus and it felt like home.”Kallenou has reaped many benefits working with Kyprianou. In addition to her three NCAA championships, she also has three Southeastern Conference titles including a indoor high jump record of 6-feet-4-inches.Kyprianou has a strong relationship with Kallenou. However, there is no special treatment as he continues to develop his team. Kyprianou has a strict schedule that holds each player accountable. This includes punishments for being late for practice and academic study sessions. However, it all is geared towards building strong work ethic and relationship.  


 


 “His schedule is very hard and you need to be a tough character to accomplish it,” Kallenou said. “I think I became a better person and I have more confidence in myself than when I first came here.”A typical day of Kallenou’s schedule is lifting at early in the morning then class at 8 a.m. Afterwards, it’s workouts in the afternoon, treatment, homework or studying and meals sprinkled in between.  The formula seems tough but it is effective in developing young athletes with focus and attention.“Work ethic is huge” assistant coach Tatijana Jacobson said. “A lot of it is maturity. Specifically for the jumpers, it is the work ethic and drive that those kids higher to the next level.” This year, Kallenou will be leading the women’s track team one final time. She continues to be successful and has come a long way in her journey.  Her work ethic has improved through her coaches’ trust.It is something that has made Kyprianou proud as countryman and a coach for all his athletes. “I know the perseverance and the immigrant factor,” Kyprianou said. “They are extremely grateful for the opportunity and the work ethic. I feel it too. I am extremely grateful for what the University of Georgia has given me.”","Jaylon Thompson

5-Sep-15,From Greece to Georgia: New track head coach ready for season with new staff in tow,"Georgia track and field saw a compete overhaul of its coaching staff this season. Coach Petros Kyprianou highlights these changes which also include new assistant coaches Ken Harnden, Devin West and Tatijana Jacobson.Kyprianou was promoted to head coach of the team this year after serving as the associate head coach last season. He was an Olympic coach for his native country of Greece, and he hopes to bring that experience to the Georgia team.


 


Kyprianou was originally brought to Georgia as the jumps and combined events coach, a post he held with great success, but his ambition allowed him to jump on the opportunity of promotion following the departure of previous coach Wayne Norton.Kyprianou knows he has greater responsibility for the athletes now that he’s in charge of the whole team rather than just a small group. However, he is confident in his ability to give them what they need, both as athletes and students.“Providing high performance guidelines to them, because they’re here at this level. Because they want to be great. And at the same time, offer an exceptional student-athlete experience. Those two are the main characteristics of my philosophy as a head coach,” Kyprianou said.Kyprianou also emphasizes the importance of knowing what’s going on inside the minds of his athletes. He credits his background as both an immigrant and a world-class athlete for giving him some insight into what many of his competitors are thinking, as members of the team hail from all over the world.“All those kids are coming from different backgrounds, different cultures, different countries. You’ve got to adjust to the way they think. In my background as a former decathlete and I was raised in a different country, I’m extremely blessed and fortunate to see where they’re coming from, and looking to the future, what they want from this program,” Kyprianou said.As soon as he was appointed head coach, Kyprianou had some important decisions to make. He had three vacancies to fill at assistant coach positions.“You’ve got to hire good people if you want to be successful,” Kyprianou said.One of those positions was filled by coach Ken Harnden, who comes Florida State as the new associate head coach and sprints coach. Like Kyprianou, Harnden is not from America. He grew up in Zimbabwe. Also like Kyprianou, Harnden has enjoyed great success in what he does. He was considered one of the top assistant coaches in track and field at Florida State, and Kyprianou was eager to invite him to coach for Georgia.


 


Harnden doesn’t think there’s a magical formula to being a good coach, but he knows what sets him apart from everyone else.“There’s no one on the planet that will ever outwork me,” Harnden said, “I pride myself in being a harder worker than anyone else. I’m not saying I’m better than them, but I will outwork them.” Another new addition to the coaching staff is Devin West, who joins Georgia after spending a year as an assistant coach at Texas Tech. West’s first collegiate coaching position was at Kennesaw State, and he was excited to return to coaching in the state that first gave him a chance in the coaching world.One of the reasons Kyprianou chose West is because of his proficiency in recruiting. West attributes his prowess in recruiting to the premium he puts on the development of student-coach relationships. West also brings confidence and a relentless drive to win – it's infectious.“I don’t think we think about anything else,” West said, “We want to win.”The third assistant coaching vacancy was filled by coach Tatijana Jacobson. Jacobson is new to coaching, having graduated from Eastern Michigan in 2013. She was a high jumper there, and she believes her youth and recent experience will help her bond more easily with the athletes.While she wasn’t the most experienced candidate for the job, Jacobson believes here hard-working and competitive nature are what helped her stand out to coach Kyprianou. “I’m competitive,” Jacobson said, “This is probably one of the most competitive staffs in the country, which is exciting to be a part of.”

Competitive is an apt word to describe the all of the coaches new to Georgia track and field. While receiving that kind of promotion is big news no matter who you are, Kyprianou appreciates it perhaps more than anyone else could.“When you grow up with nothing, and you get something, you appreciate everything,” Kyprianou said.",Nate Berg,sports,https://www.redandblack.com/sports/from-greece-to-georgia-new-track-head-coach-ready-for/article_5859e2d4-5384-11e5-8750-5766143cb41f.html
5-Sep-15,"Greyson Lambert shows off arm, leadership ability in debut as Georgia's starting quarterback","After the ball left his hand, after it sailed through the air toward the front corner of the north end zone, after wide receiver Malcolm Mitchell contorted in the air to come back to the ball and twisted his body just in time to stay in bounds and after the referee threw his arms in the air to signal touchdown, Greyson Lambert came to a realization.“This is going to be a lot of fun,” he said.In his first game as the Georgia Bulldog's starting quarterback, Lambert outplayed his expectations based on his subpar 2014 at Virginia, posting an efficiency rating 220.4 on an 8-for-12 day with 141 yards passing and two touchdowns in a 51-14 win over UL-Monroe. For the most part, Georgia’s game plan was simple and conservative, leading to Lambert’s efficient outing. But on that throw to Mitchell, a 28-yard touchdown pass with 6:40 remaining in the third quarter to extend the Georgia lead to 44-14, Lambert made the best of his first opportunity to prove that he’s more than just the guy who hands the ball off to Nick Chubb.


 


In Mitchell’s opinion, that play was more than just a chance for Lambert to make a statement. It was a defining moment for the offense as a whole.“That was the first really deep ball we had thrown so I wanted to take advantage of it,” Mitchell said. “So when the ball was in the air, I wanted to make sure that I caught it so [offensive coordinator Brian Schottenheimer] would call it again.”But as pivotal as the play might’ve been for Mitchell and the receiving corps, they weren’t being scrutinized under the same interrogation-room-like conditions as Lambert was. As a player most Georgia fans had never seen play before, Lambert found himself in the precarious position of having to simultaneously make good impressions for the fans and his teammates alike.Whether or not Lambert won over the fans is yet to be seen. But the impression he made on his teammates has already been cemented.“I think he earned everything that he’s going to get,” Mitchell said. “He earned the moments out there on the field and he executed when it was time.”Mitchell went on to say that he was especially impressed with how well Lambert kept his rapport with the receivers. Between drives, Mitchell said, Lambert chiseled his way into the receiver huddle to communicate with his targets about what they were seeing and the adjustments they should make, something Mitchell said he and his teammates found motivating.Georgia coach Mark Richt said motivating teammates is just a by-product of being a quarterback; the quarterback is a leader, even when he doesn’t think he is or want to be. And by Richt’s approximation, Lambert is putting himself in the position to assume that mantle.“When quarterbacks prepare well, when quarterbacks play well, when quarterbacks get us in the right play and the right position, our guys know the deal,” Richt said. “If he’s up their flying around and doesn’t know what he’s doing, they’re going to lose faith in him. But he’s been very sharp. Guys respect that.”

12-Sep-15,SGA strives to create open dialogue on campus,"The Student Government Association recently created a new position within its cabinet to ensure that students from marginalized populations are represented within the organization.“This university has had some incidents in the past regarding relations with students who are not a part of the majority,"" said SGA President Johnelle Simpson. ""We wanted to make sure we had a position that was bringing ideas to the table as well as being proactive and having dialogues around these difficult and sensitive issues.""Kiondre Dunnam has been named as SGA's first Director of Student Affairs.


 


“Sitting down and talking to people on opposing sides does not force you to change your mind, but it allows for understanding and respect of others' opinions,"" said the senior middle school education major from Douglas.The biggest initiative that the Campus Affairs board will foster throughout the semester is hosting Open Dialogue events.Dunman said SGA’s role in Open Dialogues will be as a moderator.“A lot can change when people sit down and talk to each other,” Dunnam said. “We’re in college, and we’re supposed to be learning and growing.""Dunman will gauge what is on students’ minds before setting a program schedule.Dunnam said he would love to partner with initiatives that are already taking place within the Black Affairs Council, Hispanic Student Association, the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer community and more.“Campus inclusivity is what we are striving for,” Dunnam said. “I think inclusivity is good to talk about, but I think this new position is going to allow us to walk it out.”",Marlee Middlebrooks @marlee_mbrooks,uganews,https://www.redandblack.com/uganews/sga-strives-to-create-open-dialogue-on-campus/article_540d280c-5885-11e5-aac4-dfd174c32cfb.html
13-Sep-15,Food Services permanently removes dining hall trays,"In order to preserve resources, University of Georgia Food Services has completely removed all trays in the dining halls this semester.And while some students support the change, others would like to have their trays back.“I think it’s an insult to how much money we pay,” said Vuk Lacmanovic, a sophomore biology major from Acworth.


 


And Davis Woods, a junior agricultural business major from Augusta, said he misses the trays.""But I feel like there’s a good reason for [the lack of trays],” he said.UGA Food Services implemented the new trayless policy after testing the initiative last spring.“We have seen positive impacts from trayless dining,"" said Allison Brannen, public relations coordinator for the UGA Food Services.Before removing the trays, students would take multiple plates of food on a single tray, she said. Now students enjoy fresher food because it spends less time sitting on their trays. And the dish room has been able to operate much more efficiently without having to wash as many trays, Brannen said.  “[The trayless initiative] also decreases the amount of water, energy and detergent used,” she said.  Last spring, Food Services held a week-long trayless experiment in Snelling Dining Commons that resulted in a 27 percent decrease in food waste and 16.4 percent decrease in water wasted. 


 


This conservation ends up preserving roughly 107,142 pounds of food and 16,550 gallons of water per semester, according to Food Services.“Its wonderful,” said Aashana Kumar a sophomore economics major from Milton. “I hated using trays last year. It was such an inconvenience. All my plates would slide around, I would get stuff I knew I didn’t need just cause I knew I could fit it on my tray.""",Mia Falcon @miae467,uganews,https://www.redandblack.com/uganews/food-services-permanently-removes-dining-hall-trays/article_74dbbe2a-5986-11e5-995a-f703c5a8218e.html
16-Sep-15,Measures taken to control student crowds at Sanford Stadium,"During one of the most hallowed traditions of the University of Georgia, students will gather on Saturday outside Sandford Stadium before the football game against South Carolina.And this year, students hoping to sit in the student section near the Redcoat Marching Band must enter through Gate 3. Students wanting to sit in the student section in the end zone must enter Gate 1. All other students should enter Gate 4A.Last football season, the students who wanted to sit in the largest seating section by the band entered through Gate 4A, and Matt Brachowski, associate athletic director for event management, said the location was very compact.


 


Therefore, the policy was changed for this football season, and it was first tested during the first home game. At the most crowded gate, Gate 3, the number of lines for students to have their IDs scanned has increased to 14, and the lines are separated by 70 to 80 feet of barricade, according to Brachowski.“For the first game of the season, we had over 13,000 students scan into the game, which gave us a pretty good test for how the new barricades worked,” Brachowski said. “We won’t really know how well it works until a big game like this weekend, but afterwards we will have a better idea on whether or not we need to tweak things for other games.”Alex Peterson, a senior management information systems major from Canton, said the barricades helped at the first game.“It’s hard to have a solution to the problem when there are so many people trying to get into a gate so fast, but the barricades definitely don’t hurt the problem,” Peterson said.  “You don’t have to deal with being in a huge crowd of people and then dividing at the last second to try to get into a certain gate. You are already in a line.” Bert Thompson, the student athletic representative, said he stood in line at Gate 3 during the University of Louisiana-Monroe game and that the experience was calm and under control. “The barricades did a good job of keeping the crowd in position, and they facilitated easy access to the stadium,"" Thompson said. ""I think that they will help in a similar manner for the South Carolina game, although the size of the game relative to the [UL-Monroe] game will certainly make a difference.""Brachowski said students should not see crowding issues at the larger games, like South Carolina and Alabama, due to the lottery that was implemented to award only a specific number of student tickets.“The need to cap the total number of students that could go to these games was the biggest change we made. We didn’t want to, but the lottery took away the concern that not all students would be able to get into the stadium,” Brachowski said.


 


Peterson understood the need for the lottery, but he said doesn’t think it was handled the right way.“I understand what is trying to be done by reducing the number of tickets given to students because giving a student a ticket and then turning them down at the gate is way worse than just not giving him or her a ticket to begin with, but I think the problem was that no one was forewarned that there was a possibility of not getting a ticket to one of the big games,” Peterson said.As a whole, Brachowski said the changes that have been made will only help with crowd control. “We are going to look to see how we can improve every week to see how we can better do things,” Brachowski said. “We are treating every game like we are going to have a full crowd of students because ultimately, that is what we want.”","Marlee Middlebrooks

19-Sep-15,UGA reacts with nostalgia: Pokemon goes mobile,"In a press release on Sept. 10, The Pokemon Company, along with Niantic and Nintendo, introduced Pokemon GO, an app that will release on Android and iOS systems that combines the virtual world of Pokemon games with mobile devices.Niantic was originally recognized for creating Ingress, a mobile game known for its use of GPS technology. Pokemon GO will use the same technology.By incorporating the locations and geography of the world into the map of Pokemon GO, players will be given a more fulfilling and realistic experience. Although much information of the game has not been released yet, waves of excitement are already forming.


 


For those that grew up on the Pokemon TV series, handheld games, movies and other additions, the opportunity for a fresh gaming experience with the same lovable characters is enough to sell immediately.“I’m super excited about it. Even if it’s badly made I will still play it,” said Sarah Khan, a third year computer science major. “It’s nostalgic because I used to play Pokemon a lot when I was younger and recently I picked it back up again... I love them. And now you get to pretend you’re a real Pokemon trainer. It’s really exciting.”The game director of the Pokemon video game series, Junichi Masuda, is also contributing to Pokemon GO, ensuring some of the characteristics of the original games will shine through in the new version but with twists to accommodate for modern technology.Users will be able to catch and train Pokemon and battle other trainers via their mobile screens. The use of a real-world landscape encourages the player to explore and travel in order to see as much of the game — and world — as possible. The game also plans to have group events where trainers can meet up in real life in order to battle powerful Pokemon or defeat an enemy. For ‘90s children, this means a real-life extension of the nostalgic series that defined an entire generation.The trailer below shows a demonstration of what the graphics and gameplay will look like.However, there are many details of the game that have not been disclosed for its 2016 release. For example, it is unclear if specific Pokemon will only be available in certain regions. Purchasing options will appear in-game, but whether or not these purchases are required to get further in the game is unclear.Players will also have the option of purchasing a Pokemon GO Plus, a Pokéball-type device that can be worn on a strap or clipped onto the user. It uses Bluetooth technology to alert the player with flashing LED lights and slight vibration to the whereabouts of any in-game Pokemon that are close to the user’s real-life location.


 


The Plus is not necessary to play Pokemon GO, but it is supposed to smooth the transition from virtual reality to reality by allowing players to play the game without looking at a phone screen — allowing more interaction with the real world.Although the news of Pokemon GO has not reached full audiences yet, it is estimated by some to be one of the most anticipated games of 2016.For those that have grown up with the Pokemon series as well as new fans, another chapter of the story is about to start.",Maria Lewczyk @redandblack,variety,https://www.redandblack.com/variety/uga-reacts-with-nostalgia-pokemon-goes-mobile/article_ceaf7986-5d60-11e5-9a9e-53407727a8be.html
21-Sep-15,"Mac Miller declines, still remains complex with ""GO:OD AM""","Very few artists have had more difficulty distancing themselves from their past work than Pittsburgh-based rapper Mac Miller. 2011’s overtly vapid “Blue Slide Park,” though immensely successful, continues to loom over Miller, and has consistently prevented his acceptance into more serious musical circles. However, since 2011, Miller has proved himself time and time again that there’s more to him than the frat rap of early records like “Blue Slide Park” or 2010’s “K.I.D.S.” mixtape.In 2013, Miller unexpectedly hit fans with “Watching Movies with the Sound Off,” a sprawling landscape of unorthodox textures, tape manipulation and atmospheric synths that found the rapper trying to prove his legitimacy.


 


Though he’s no longer employing the same beat experimentation that was so prominent on “Watching Movies with the Sound Off,” Miller impresses in other ways on his newest record, called “GO:OD AM.” On the new album, which came out Sept. 18, the rapper’s bars are fiercer than ever and his word play is at his most dazzling, even if his psychedelic production style is noticeably absent from album’s credits.On the “GO:OD AM,” horn sections blare, pianos glisten and the psychedelic jazz Miller has appropriated over the past two years of his career is still wholly present, albeit in a slightly more polished form.However, polish does not necessarily yield quality. “Watching Movies with the Sound Off” was a landmark hip-hop record because of its rebellion against the popular musical textures heard at the time. Conversely, “GO:OD AM” finds Miller dealing in many textures he has purposefully avoided in the past.By far the album’s strongest standout track, “100 Grandkids” finds Miller straddling the old and the new, as the song combines the psychedelia of Miller’s last record with disorienting jazz hooks and the type of angular trap beats that can be heard elsewhere on “GO:OD AM.”Tracks like “100 Grandkids”, as well as “Rush Hour” and “Break the Law,” are fantastic testimonies to Miller’s steeply rising trajectory as an artist since 2011. Lyrically, Miller is at his most confessional and personal delivering shattering hooks with an honest found in few other places in the hip-hop world. “The world don’t give a f*** about your loneliness,” Mac iterates on “Rush Hour.""Throughout the course of the ablum, Miller comes to terms with all that he has gained in the past four years, but also ruminates on his heartbreaks and what he has lost to a world that seems to be moving even faster than he is.Miller’s post-2011 release may have earned Mac rap’s unofficial “Most Improved” award, whereas “GO:OD AM,” though fantastic at times, shows has complacency seeping through its cracks. 


 


Nonetheless, the record is still one of the best hip-hip projects of the year so far, and proves Mac Miller has more than paid his due for his earlier, shallower work. To Miller, “Blue Slide Park” is irrelevant, and it should be to you too. You can listen to ""GO:OD AM"" below:",Cooper Casale @cooper_casale,variety,https://www.redandblack.com/variety/mac-miller-declines-still-remains-complex-with-go-od-am/article_7ae49cba-6016-11e5-9866-5311e6f9abc0.html
22-Sep-15,UGA's real season pass: The All Arts Card,"With football season well underway, it’s easy to have a mind set on sporting events. However, the University of Georgia is looking to focus students’ attention on the arts with the new All Arts Card.The $99 card allows students to pay one price and attend any of UGA’s 64 concerts, plays and other performances. Though it may sound like a lot of money, the price of each of the performances combined is more than $2,000. The card lowers the average cost of each event from $31 to just $1.62. “This is an awesome bargain for students and they won’t find a deal like this after they graduate, so take advantage of it now,” said Bobby Tyler, the marketing and media relations director of the UGA Performing Arts Center.


 


The All Arts Card was created by the UGA Arts Council which is made up of prominent members that represent the arts and humanities across campus, such as the Performing Arts Center, the Georgia Museum of Art and Hugh Hodgson School of Music.“We decided to develop this concept called the UGA All Arts Card that would allow a student, through the purchase of one card, to really have limitless access to all of the performing and visual arts around campus,” said Russell Mumper, vice provost for academic affairs and chair of the UGA Arts Council.The All Arts card also makes it easier and cheaper to attend events instead of paying cash at every performance.“We wanted to continue to try new things to attract either students in the arts and humanities or students not in the arts and humanities to experience all of the wonderful things that are happening here at UGA,” Mumper said.Mumper also emphasized how the UGA Arts Council wants all students to attend these events. All 36,000 undergraduates and graduate students should have an opportunity to experience them, he said.UGA is not the first school to create a card providing entry to all arts events. Mumper said other prominent universities around the country have similar cards.“We’ve learned a lot from what they’re doing and thought this would be a neat thing for students,” Mumper said. “It gives them the opportunity to literally go to as much as they want to go to.”The price of the All Arts Card is a bargain, however, the seemingly daunting price could deter some students from purchasing.


 


“I think it’s definitely a cool idea, though kind of expensive,” said Savannah Kornder, a junior management information systems major from Decatur. “I’m sure there are students that will go for it though.”The card lasts until May 2016 and is for students only.“One of our core missions is to enhance experiences and exposure of all students,” Mumper said. “The more you experience, the more you benefit.”",Emma Hunt @ehunt831,variety,https://www.redandblack.com/variety/uga-s-real-season-pass-the-all-arts-card/article_abeb155c-60d7-11e5-8405-b3659658e047.html

25-Sep-15,How to handle homesickness,"Every fall the same homesick feeling creeps over campus. You can almost physically feel the stress bouncing off every student as the workload starts getting tougher, the leaves start changing and the air gets cooler. There’s just something about the weather that creates a feeling of nostalgia back to being home carving pumpkins, driving down back roads and sitting around the fire watching a football game with your family that makes you want to nestle into your mother’s arms.         Homesickness is something that every college student has had to deal with at some point in his or her life. It may creep up on you when you least expect it. Or you might feel it when you’re in class listening to your professor go on and on about the intricate structure of plants. The time I usually feel the most homesick is when I’m up all night studying for a test; sleep deprived and delirious.         Everyone experiences different levels of homesickness. For out-of-staters like me, it’s hard not to miss life back home, especially if you’re from somewhere completely different than the South. I grew up on Long Island, basically another planet. After high school I was ready to leave New York and meet new people. As the initial excitement of being in a new place wore off and summer began fading into fall, I started missing my family more and more. I called my mom at least three times a day just to hear her voice.


 


         Now, currently in my third year of college, I experience the same feelings of homesickness as I did my first semester freshman year. You would think that as the years pass you would get used to being away from your family, but that’s a myth. The older you get, the more you wish you were wrapped in a bear hug by your mom and dad. As you get further into adulthood, you realize how scary it is to be out in the real world.College is all about growing up and stepping out of your comfort zone, it’s the first step into becoming a true independent adult. When you feel stressed and lost, and trust me, you will, calling your parents can help you push through. It’s hard when you’re balancing so many things at once to not want to be back home with your family.The thing to remember, and that I sometimes forget, is that it’s okay to be homesick and miss you’re family but it’s not okay to dwell on it and miss out on all the good times you could be having at UGA. These four years are meant to be some of the best years of your life, so while homesickness is a natural part of being in college, don’t let it ruin your experience. The best way to avoid being homesick is to keep busy. Try to get involved with as many things as you can and don’t dwell on what you can’t change. Make the most of your time here because the years will fly by.-Savannah Steele is a junior from New York majoring in public relationsOpinions expressed in The Red & Black are the opinions of the writers and not necessarily those of The Red & Black Publishing Co., Inc.

27-Sep-15,Youth Lagoon grows up with 'Savage Hills Ballroom',"Trevor Powers, the creator and leader of the dream pop group Youth Lagoon, has journeyed a long way from the home recorded closet-tracks of “The Year of Hibernation,” the songwriter’s 2011 debut.Through three albums and half a decade of indie pop stardom, Powers, along with his music, has grown up. Youth Lagoon’s newest record, “Savage Hills Ballroom,” reaches a level of maturity musically and thematically that Powers’ earlier albums failed to present.The Boise, Idaho-based songwriter has always had a knack for tapping into nostalgia and the loss of innocence, but on the new album, listeners hear a fresh wave of adult subject matter sneak into the stream of consciousness lyrical delivery that is so signature of Youth Lagoon’s music.  


 


Powers rants with disgust about prescription drug use and uniformity in “Rotten Human,” provides an anecdote of gambling and drug addiction in “Kerry” and comments on the monotony of the nine-to-five life in “Again,” all of which play in succession on the album and solidify the singer’s growth as an lyricist.Youth Lagoon’s themes sometimes feel Holden Caulfield-esque as reflections on past imagination and heartbreak are replaced by a dark, worldly criticism. Powers’ most evocative condemnation comes “Again,” when the singer declares, “Each day is all the same, You don’t pray for love but you pray for change/ You don’t pray for sun but you pray for rain/You ask god what is your name.”Like a short play, the album seems to be divided into two acts, which are separated by the track “Doll’s Estate.” The piano ballad of bobbing decrescendo sits purposefully mid-way through the record at track five, offering no lyrics, leaving listeners with only their own thoughts to dwell on.The last song on the album, “X-Ray,” has a similar affect, and even leaves 30 seconds of utter silence after its final, fading note rings out.The first half of the album is overall less morose, and includes some of themes that Youth Lagoon records have dealt with in the past, such as lost love, hate, being ostracized and general worldly flaws.Powers has always been exceptional at verbal imagery, and a nice bit of it surfaces in his earlier lyrics on “Savage Hills Ballroom.” The track “No One Can Tell” provides an excellent example of this, with the lyrics, “The bright groom standing smitten inside the ballroom/ But lying fetal in the earth womb/We are all babies born too soon.”Powers is also clearer with his lyricism during the 36 minute musical escapade. Listeners no longer have to play his cracking muffled voice over and over again just to finally hear each pronunciation.Along with the album’s lyrics, the music in “Savage Hills Ballroom” has evidently matured and evolved from Powers’ previous works as well.


 


Life moves at a faster pace during adulthood, so it is only natural that the album’s tempo and key signatures push forward rapidly throughout its 10-track run, with the head of the charge being lead by a beating drum pad. New elements of instrumentation are apparent in this record too, including more aggressive, blaring synths and horn melodies instead of Powers’ usual background pad tones.The band intentionally made its declaration of change loud and clear by shocking the audience with “Savage Hills Ballroom’s” the first track, “Officer Telephone.” The song starts with trite organ notes played under Powers’ soft voice, but out of nowhere, blasts into a full display of Youth Lagoon’s newfound style, projecting fullness and strength.Fans of Youth Lagoon since its humble beginnings have witnessed Trevor Powers grow as both a songwriter and musician throughout his career, traveling out of adolescence in “The Year of Hibernation,” and hitting puberty on 2013’s “Wondrous Bughouse.”Now Powers emerges as a matured, defined and incredibly talented adult on “The Savage Hills Ballroom.”You can listen to ""Savage Hills Ballroom"" below:",Wes Jones @who_wesjones,variety,https://www.redandblack.com/variety/youth-lagoon-grows-up-with-savage-hills-ballroom/article_9262d016-652d-11e5-bf7f-7711a1bf0945.html

The next year, the group quickly followed up on its mainstream success with the release of its debut album ""Settle.”The brothers have since been working on the album ""Caracal,"" which, after much anticipation, finally came out on Friday, Sept. 25. Fans of the electronic dance music genre will find the latest Disclosure album to be a continuation of the group's already refined and established style. From upbeat tempos to mellow rhythms, the album contains potential new favorites for fans of the English duo.


 


The songs on “Caracal” move through a number of different speeds and vibes as the album progresses. Tracks such as ""Masterpiece"" and ""Omen"" move along at a slower, more relaxed tempo, while songs such as ""Hourglass,"" ""Jaded"" and ""Echoes"" have a faster, dance-inducing vibe that wouldn’t sound out of place at a dance club.The album reflects many different aspects of the EDM genre, from the vocal reverb of ""Holding On,"" to the blending chorus of ""Jaded.""Several famous guest singers make appearances on the album, adding signature vocal styles to the distinct beats and grooves of Disclosure’s music. The star-studded list of contributors includes The Weekend, Sam Smith and Lorde, who delivers a particularly strong performance on the song ""Magnets.""While most of the album’s songs feature well-known singers, the tracks ""Jaded"" and ""Echoes"" feature singing by the two brothers.Even though the record’s songs will likely be received well by fans of club and house music, the more general listener may find that the tracks seem to run together somewhat. Although practically every song on “Caracal” varies in tempo, in terms of structure, set up and execution they are almost identical. Sometimes, it feels as though the expansive cast of featured singers is the only major difference between each song. In this way, the identities of the guest vocalists are somewhat lost behind more blend backing tracks.Even though some talented artists are featured on the record, the album’s repetitive nature gives the listener the sense that any other singer could have performed just as well. Despite these flaws, “Caracal” still holds up well as an EDM album, while its lack of variation limits more casual audiences from falling in love with the record. While the release may not appeal to a wide range of music lovers, there can be no doubt that the songs of the album will resonate throughout bars and clubs across the nation, which is probably enough to continue Disclosure’s steady rise to stardom.

28-Sep-15,Removal of coal boiler leads to traffic sign changes,"After the University of Georgia shut off its coal boiler, ending its need for coal brought in by rail, traffic along the railroad tracks that stretch alongside East Campus Road has all but come to an end.""Now that UGA no longer needs coal, there's really not any traffic along that particular line,"" said Steve Decker, county traffic engineer.With the chance of locomotives traveling along the line from Center in Jackson County to Bishop in Oconee County close to zero, the Athens-Clarke County mayor and commissioner approved an ordinance in early September to remove stop signs at the railroad crossing between Foundry and Hickory streets near the Athens Transit station, replacing them with yield signs.


 


If the line had been declared entirely inactive, traffic signs at the crossing could have been taken down completely, Decker said.But Decker said the owner of the Athens Line Company that operates the rail line said the line will not be declared inactive and instead will remain open for any potential customers.""They didn't want to shut down the line completely,"" Decker said. ""They wanted to keep it open just as a possibility to have future customers. But as far as routine traffic, the track will be relatively quiet.Because of this, some amount of signage is required at the crossing. The county has decided to install yield signs as well as a sign that says “look” with an arrow pointing in down directions down the tracks.Decker said this conforms to the Federal Highway Administration’s Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices.The crossing has been marked with just stop signs since 1975, he said, Should traffic along the line pick up, stop signs might be placed there again.But for now, yield signs should help ease the flow of traffic at the crossing and reduce pollution from vehicles stopping at the tracks, Decker said.","Nate Harris

30-Sep-15,Letter to the Editor: Blazer pride despite terminated football program,"How ‘bout them Blazers?When the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB) abruptly terminated its bowl-eligible football team last December, at least 55 UAB Blazers football players transferred to schools from coast to coast. That’s how the Bulldogs ended up with former UAB player Jake Ganus, who is now a starting linebacker for the Dawgs and a semifinalist for the Campbell Trophy honoring college football’s premier scholar-athlete.   (He’s probably also a finalist for a Most Romantic Linebacker ESPY Award after his post-game marriage proposal following the trouncing of South Carolina.)


 


But did you know that Jordan Howard of Indiana University, who is leading all of major college football in rushing yards, is also a transfer from UAB?  It could have been a great 2015 season for UAB, contending for the Conference USA championship with the Conference’s Coach of the Year Bill Clark at the helm.  Instead, Blazer fans are left to root for transfers scattered all the way from San Diego State to Buffalo until 2017, when UAB football will be back after a huge public outcry.The Bulldog Nation can help us out this Saturday when Georgia plays Alabama.  If you’re happy Jake Ganus is making tackles and picking off passes, show a little Blazer pride on our behalf.  How?  Let rip a “Go Blazers!,” “#FreeUAB,” or “U...A...B” during Saturday’s game.  Make sure you direct it toward the skysuites on the north side of the stadium, where the Board of Trustees of the University of Alabama System will likely be.Make sure the trustees and the TV cameras get the message that UAB isn’t forgotten, and that it’s coming back.  Think of it as a chance to dish out a little deserved justice on top of a decisive Bulldog victoryGo Dawgs, and Go Blazers!—John Knox is an associate professor of geography at UGA and a UAB alumnus (summa cum laude, 1988)Opinions expressed in The Red & Black are the opinions of the writers and not necessarily those of The Red & Black Publishing Co., Inc.

1-Oct-15,On the Road: Rat Babies,"For those not familiar, Rat Babies is a local experimental metal group that blends psychedelic and noise ideas into a slowed-down rock backbone. Since 2005, several different iterations of the band have put out recordings and played shows both locally and on tour.The group is currently a duo consisting of drummer Chodd and bassist/vocalist Mux Blank. Although these two form the backbone of Rat Babies, several members have come and gone throughout the years, and various versions of the band have played live shows.Many of the group’s tours only last a couple days, but Rat Babies has done longer excursions on occasion, staying on the road for several weeks at a time. The band stays mostly in the eastern half of the United States but has played shows as far west as Texas.


 


One defining characteristic of Rat Babies tours seems to be a D.I.Y. approach to virtually everything. Choosing such a niche sound as “swamp-metal” is, of course, fairly limiting financially, and the group’s low budget rarely leaves any room for excess while on the road.“It’s fun, not lucrative,” says drummer Chodd. “But it’s more than a hobby.”Trying to keep costs down, the members of Rat Babies usually spend the night with friends or find a generous fan with some extra floor space.“After a show, we’ll just ask around, and we’ll find a place,” says Blank. “But if we can’t, we just sleep in the van. We don’t ever really get hotel rooms. That’s too much money.”The group has also been able to lighten the financial burden of touring by bringing more people on the road. In the past, sharing bills with other bands and bringing a bigger line-up have both been ways Rat Babies has gotten more seed money on the table for a string of shows.“It helps to have another band with us to make ends meet,” says Chodd.With the polarizing genres the band blends in its music, Rat Babies often goes into shows not knowing what kind of reaction to expect from its audience. Depending on where the group is playing and what artist it might be splitting the show with, the responses from spectators can vary dramatically.“Well, with Rat Babies, it’s either blank stares or they love us,” says Blank.


 


Courtesy Rat Babies“Our best friends don’t come to our shows,” says Chodd, laughing.Of course, with the group’s unique music come plenty of unique experiences on tour. From a naked pool party to performing next to videos of fetish pornography, there’s no shortage of weird things Rat Babies has experienced.“There’s just so many. Every time you go out, you’re gonna have some crazy night because everybody’s out and just letting loose,” says Blank.Despite the strange and uncertain nature of a Rat Babies tour, though, the group’s members still find themselves getting into something of a routine during their longer strings of shows. Since driving, setting up, playing and resting take up most days of a band’s time on the road, it can be off-putting to suddenly break the pattern and return to home life.


TNCMS.AdManager.render({region: 'fixed-big-ad-bottom-asset', slot: 1, fold: ""below""});


“You get in that rhythm of doing things daily like that,” says Blank. “It’s kind of hard to come back and get back to what you were doing before you left.” After getting past the initial shock, though, the motivation that follows Rat Babies home from a string of shows is something the group loves to cash in on. After performing for fans that are genuinely excited about the group’s music, Rat Babies’ members often can’t help but get right back into creating.“It does exhaust you, but the people give you energy when you’re out there because they really appreciate what you’re doing,” says Blank. “It kind of makes you feel like, ‘Oh, I gotta do more,’ and so, when you get home, it’s like, ‘Oh let’s start recording now.’”Blank says his time on the road apart from Rat Babies has also given him inspiration on different approaches to performing at home. After hitchhiking to New Orleans with a friend and spending several months doing street performances there, he wanted to bring some of his experience with busking back to Athens.“It’s like I brought a little bit of New Orleans back, you know?” says Blank. “So I started doing street performing as ""TV Head Guy"" and other things, and that was all inspired by New Orleans – to take something and perform it on the streets, not just in venues and clubs and stuff.”Rat Babies is currently working on another full album, and the band hopes to hit the road again after completing it. As always, the band is focusing on the music it wants to make, laughing at the thought of people not caring for its songs.“We’ve been around for ten years, and we’re gonna record something and nobody’s gonna like it,” says Chodd.All jokes aside, the band looks forward to getting its new work out and is even more excited to bring it to live audiences. Fans of the group should stay on the lookout for both weekend tours and longer strings of shows in the next year.",Blake Morris,ampersand,https://www.redandblack.com/ampersand/on-the-road-rat-babies/article_c1c2b324-683b-11e5-9b87-ef60ca696bb5.html
1-Oct-15,Clarke libraries continue to celebrate National Hispanic Heritage Month,"The Athens-Clarke County Library is hosting a number of events to celebrate National Hispanic Heritage Month. Throughout the month celebration, which lasts from Sept. 15 until Oct. 15, the library will host a series of events to showcase Hispanic culture and people, according to a press release from the library. The grant-funded program, “Latino Americans: 500 Years of History,” expands on National Hispanic Heritage Month with enhanced discussions on issues facing Latinos.“We’ve celebrated this every year. We have a Spanish library in the Pinewoods area. If you look at children in the school system, we have a high population,” said Lorena Gay-Griffin, assistant director for regional services and outreach for the Athens Regional Library System. “The purpose of the library is to respond to the public. We should answer to every group. We need to celebrate every culture so everybody can be a part of the community.”The library will host a book discussion on “The Brief and Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao” by Junot Diaz on Oct. 7 at 7 p.m. The book, a story of a Dominican boy in New Jersey, emphasizes the drawbacks and positives of multiculturalism.


 


A branch of the county library system, Pinewoods Library and Learning Center, will host the Pinewoods Cultural Festival on Oct. 10 at noon. The festival includes a multitude of food, music, and artwork from various Latin American countries.Earlier this year, the American Library Association awarded the library $10,000 to conduct these programs. In collaboration with University of Georgia Libraries, the Athens Regional Library system organized the events. The UGA Main Library is hosting a book display on the first floor lobby for the next month.“UGA libraries and the Latin American Caribbean Studies Institute (LACSI) at UGA came to us and asked if we wanted to work together,” Gay-Griffin said. “Part of the requirement of the grant was that scholarly outlets were involved. So LACSI reached out to us in a big way.”Latin American Caribbean Studies Institute went further and set up its own screening for episode six of the Latin documentary series “The Latino Americans: 500 Years of History” on Oct. 15 at 6 p.m. inside the main Clarke County Library. Edward Delgado-Romero, a UGA professor with the counseling psychology department, is scheduled to lead a post-screening discussion on the episode.“Clarke County, believe it or not, has had many programs involving the Latin community. There have been programs where teachers have taken trips to Mexico, so there have been many efforts for outreach,” Delgado-Romero said. “The Latin community in Georgia is getting much larger.”Delgado-Romero teaches a First-Year Odyssey course on Latino issues from a psychological perspective. Also, he is the faculty organizer for the BIEN Research Team that researches issues affecting the Latino community. This is his first year participating in the library’s events.Delgado-Romero recognizes the challenges faced by the growing Hispanic community. He referenced statistics from the U.S. Census Bureau that showed a Latino population increase of 10.2 percent in Clarke County within the past five years.


 


“The Latino population is growing bigger, but it is also younger,” Delgado-Romero said. “That means that the biggest challenge right now is education. It should matter to students because it is the future of your county and country. Students are wanting to be global citizens and learn the strengths of what people can have in society. As a college student, people should come to be aware of things they are told.”Delgado-Romero said he thought these events would help foster more positive treatment towards Hispanics and said respect and empathy is key to helping the Hispanic community. He said he believes that education and immigration reform are the two largest challenges facing Hispanics.“I think deportation is inhumane. I would prefer some path to citizenship. I’m not in favor of repatriating people. What we’ve seen in Athens-Clarke County is people getting repatriated or detained. It breaks up families,” Delgado-Romero said. “There are a lot of Athens’ kids who find their parents are gone one day to the next. I think it needs to be taken head on. If you could imagine going to school and your parents being gone when you come home. Psychologically, that must be terrible for children. How could you even concentrate at school?”The Athens Regional Library system is celebrating National Hispanic Heritage Month to remind people of the importance of diversity in local communities. Since the month was nationally recognized in 1988, the events have been used to express the importance of diversity in American society.“We try to represent the entire community,” Lorena Gay-Griffin said. “The more we know about each other, the easier it is to live with one another.”",Matthew Kopf @redandblack,variety,https://www.redandblack.com/variety/clarke-libraries-continue-to-celebrate-national-hispanic-heritage-month/article_f0c9fe70-67d7-11e5-87c1-3fe5510f5c28.html
11-Oct-15,"In the Headlines: Doctors Without Borders hospital bombed, McCarthy drops out of Speaker race","The Red & Black has been a leader of University of Georgia news since its founding in 1893, but a lot goes on in the world beyond the Arch. From Washington D.C. to Afghanistan, here is a brief roundup of what international stories made headlines this week.1. Doctors Without Borders hospital bombed in U.S. airstrikeLast weekend, a Doctors Without Borders hospital in Kunduz, Afghanistan, was hit by an American airstrike, leaving 22 people dead. Kunduz had been taken over by the Taliban the week before. Military officials have been unclear about who called for the air strike, and they plan to conduct an investigation. The nonprofit has called the airstrike a “war crime” and plans to pursue its own independent investigation.


 


2. People magazine takes on gun controlFollowing the shooting at Umpqua Community College in Roseburg, Oregon, which left nine dead, People magazine published an editor’s letter on Wednesday that urged readers to contact their lawmakers about gun control. “As a country we clearly aren't doing enough, and our elected officials' conversations about solutions usually end in political spin,” wrote Jess Cagle, People’s editorial director. The letter includes the name, phone number and email of all 535 members of Congress.3. Pacific Rim countries reach historic Trans-Pacific PartnershipThe United States and 11 other countries agreed on the Trans-Pacific Partnership this week, opening up trade between the 12 countries, which produce almost half of the world’s goods.

Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) seemed until Thursday to be next in line to take the job of House Speaker John Boehner (R-OH), who announced last month that he would be stepping down.

16-Oct-15,"Student organizations inspired, empowered by Million Man March attendance","When the Million Man March was first organized back in 1995, over 800,000 people flocked to Washington D.C.'s National Mall to listen to speeches from African American civil rights activists.This year, to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the original rally, activists, speakers and inspired individuals once again headed to Washington in support of the “Justice or Else” campaign. The University of Georgia was represented at the event, which took place on Oct. 10, as two of the school’s organizations attended the rally.


 


The Black Male Leadership Society (or BMLS) and the UGA chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People sent 47 students to Washington D.C. over the weekend.Shallum Atkinson, president of the BMLS, said that attending the march was a great opportunity for his organization’s members to join the national black community in promoting social justice.“The fact that we were able to come together as human beings in support of social justice and many different causes that are plaguing a lot of communities was amazing and very moving for a lot of people,” Atkinson said.This year, the Million Man March featured many speakers, including head organizer Louis Farrakhan, who spoke at the first rally in 1995. Even though “Justice or Else” was the specific theme of the rally, many speakers touched on similar subjects that were shared at the march, such as calling on governmental reform in social justice and equal rights issues. Just as the rally sought to have a real influence on government policies, Atkinson sees the BMLS as a means to bring about this social change, both on campus and beyond.“Our overall mission is to foster brotherhood between black men on campus and increase their self-development,” he said. “Black men tend to have a bad reputation and a bad representation, so we strive to be the faces of men who are excelling, who care about their institution and who are devoted to giving back to their community.”BMLS was awarded UGA’s “Organization of the Year” at the Student Organization Achievement and Recognition Awards in April. The award was given specifically for the group’s efforts in improving the campus community and volunteering in the Athens area.One of the ways that the BMLS supports the city as a whole is through mentorship of kids from ages 8 to 18, in hopes that they can support and inspiration for young people in Athens.


 


“[The kids] often think that going to an institution like UGA is not obtainable, so I think it’s very important for us to be around them to show that it is possible,” Atkinson said.Attending the Million Man March was an effort to continue leading through example for the BMLS, as well as UGA’s NAACP chapter, which desires to show the Classic City its commitment to social change and community improvement.While in Washington, the students were also able to meet and network with UGA alumni that live in the city.Mansur Buffins, vice president of the UGA chapter of the NAACP, helped organize the trip to Washington D.C., and found the march to be a transformative experience.“The collective energies of all those who surrounded me on the National Mall positively overwhelmed me as I thought about the fact that everyone had converged on the scene for one purpose, and that was for justice,” Buffins said.In one of the speeches at the march, civil rights leader Benjamin Chavis noted that a certain Illinois state senator attended the first march 20 years ago. That senator, Barack Obama, went on to become the first black president of the United States. These words were meant to emphasize the progress made since the first march and the progress to come. Chavis also warned the crowd that there was still much more to be accomplished, and that much improvement can still be made.

With over 400,000 people in attendance this year, the Million Man March gave a sense of community and hope to the large crowd, and inspired its UGA attendees to turn what they learned into action back on campus.“Everyone was there for the same reason,” Atkinson said. “It’s just like the same way we’re all there to cheer on the Dawgs, we’re all there to cheer for our favorite teams, we were all there to cheer in the pursuit of social justice.”",Kaitlyn Yarborough @redandblack,variety,https://www.redandblack.com/variety/student-organizations-inspired-empowered-by-million-man-march-attendance/article_f24c9d08-73a2-11e5-8b05-73ef73f6558a.html
16-Oct-15,Edges: Georgia vs. Missouri,"Quarterback: There are no winners here. Greyson Lambert is inconsistant, and the only similarity between Maty Mauk and Drew Lock is that their names rhyme. Lock and the Missouri offense have had trouble scoring points, and Lambert’s timing on deep balls and intermediate routes is often off. Those are two of the main throws a quarterback makes, in case anyone was checking. To Lock’s credit, his completion percentage is higher than Mauk’s was before Mauk was suspended, but Mauk is by far the more versatile player given his ability to run the ball. It is yet to be seen whether or not Mauk will play in this game, and Mark Richt said that his team is preparing for Lock to start. The Tigers have the edge if Mauk starts, but as things stand Lambert has shown he can submit a complete performance.Edge: Georgia, but with an accompanying shoulder shrugTailback: With Nick Chubb out, Sony Michel becomes the No. 1 back for the Bulldogs. Michel is talented, but he has always been aided by Chubb and has not been the feature back as he presumably will be for the rest of the season. With that said, Michel has had an outstanding season thus far, and that should not be discounted. As for his backup, Brendan Douglas’s music might yet again play. Douglas played a lot more last season than this season, and while he is capable, he is certainly not Sony Michel or Nick Chubb.


 


On the Missouri side, Russell Hansbrough is by far the Tigers’ best player on offense and often their only source of offense. Hansbrough is a bit undersized, but can run between the tackles and has the speed to break away. He has been hampered by injuries, and in that time sophomore Ish Witter has stepped up and given Missouri somewhat of a two-throng rushing attack. However, it’s hard to imagine them having a lot of success with Georgia’s defensive line keying in on them, especially with the emergence of Trenton Thompson. That combined with Georgia’s natural ability and penchant to run the ball gives them the edge.Edge: GeorgiaWide Receivers: Both of these teams don’t have a lot of star power at wide receiver, with Malcolm Mitchell as the only standout on either side. Reggie Davis emerged last game as a potential legitimate no. 2 for the Bulldogs, but it is yet to be seen whether he can string a few performances like that together.On the Missouri side, J’Mon Moore and Nate Brown are solid targets who have combined for over 400 yards each and six touchdowns, but did next to nothing against Florida last week in a game the Tigers really needed to win. Neither unit is a particularly reliable, and a big decider in this game will be which team is able to pass better. Because of Mitchell’s rapport with Lambert, his ability as a deep threat and the potential for Michel to line up as a receiver and catch passes from the backfield more as a feature back, Georgia has the upper hand.Slight edge: Georgia Special Teams: To paraphrase the late, great Yogi Berra, Georgia’s kicking game made this section necessary. Marshall Morgan, once a sure thing, missed another field goal against Tennessee last week. He is only hitting 66 percent of his field goals compared to Missouri’s Andrew Baggett’s 80 percent. Corey Fatony of Missouri is averaging a full two yards higher on his punts than Collin Barber. Barber’s punts against Tennessee looked like he launched a loaf of bread rather than a football, and this has to be an increasing area of concern for Georgia if Morgan continues to miss kicks and Barber is consistently giving up field position. Georgia’s kicking game will be something to keep an eye on Saturday, and in a game they desperately need to win, the little things always add up, and this is one of them. Right now, the team does not have complete control of this one. Edge: Missouri

It is still unclear who fired the missile.


 


2. Planned Parenthood to no longer accept reimbursement for fetal tissuePlanned Parenthood announced this week that it will no longer accept reimbursements to cover the costs of fetal tissue donations used for research. Earlier this year, a pro-life group released undercover videos that appear to show officials from Planned Parenthood discussing the selling of organs and tissue from aborted fetuses for a profit, which is illegal. Planned Parenthood denied the allegations, but the videos led to multiple investigations. And a debate over whether to cut federal funding to Planned Parenthood almost led to a government shutdown. The organization announced Tuesday it will now cover the costs of these fetal tissue donation programs.3. Georgia executes only woman on death rowGeorgia executed Kelly Gissendaner, the only woman on death row, on Sept. 30, even after Pope Francis requested that the state spare her. Gissendaner was sentenced to death nearly 20 years ago for plotting to kill her husband, who was murdered by her boyfriend. The execution had been delayed multiple times. Last week, Pope Francis sent a request to the Georgia parole board that they spare her. She was executed by lethal injection.4.

23-Oct-15,"AthHalf enters 6th year, adds virtual runner program","For six years now, the AthHalf Half Marathon has given Athenians an opportunity to showcase their endurance, raise money and enjoy a run through some of the city’s most scenic locations. However, not every runner who wants to participate is available on Oct. 25, the day of the race.To rectify this issue, AthFest Educates, the organization responsible for running the AthHalf, is offering a new virtual runner option for people who want to complete the race but can’t be physically present this at the starting line this Sunday.“The virtual runner allows people who aren’t going to be in Athens on the actual race day to run a half marathon on their own schedule and then submit their time,” said Jill Helme, the executive director of AthFest Educates. “And then we enter them into the official, AthHalf 2015 participants, and we mail them a medal and a T-shirt.”


 


AthFest Educates also hosts the AthFest music and arts festival each summer. The money raised from both the race and the yearly festival is then used to award grants to educators and youth development specialists, as well as promote music and arts education within Athens.“Pretty much everything we have been able to accomplish in the last five years or so has been because of that race,” Helme said. “The festival is fantastic and is absolutely a part of our mission, but, unfortunately, the festival isn’t incredibly profitable.”Helme said compared to the AthHalf, AthFest is contributes a relatively tiny amount to the organization’s overall charity funds.“On a good year, maybe [AthFest will] make $10,000,” she said. “But we started the race as a way to have a revenue stream that would actually allow us to be able to make a meaningful brand.”The AthHalf has become a yearly tradition for many runners, and missing the race would mean upsetting a multi-year streak of participation. Helme said the idea for the virtual runner option came when “two women that ran the race every single year [had] to be out of town for a work conference,” during the weekend of the race.The women reached out to Helme, and the virtual runner program was born.“It’s been very interesting seeing who has chosen to run the virtual option,” Helme said. “We have legacy runners that can’t make it this particular year. We [also] have people who no longer live in Athens that want to stay connected to the race.”One of the individuals choosing the virtual option also happens to be performing at the starting line on race day. Kevin Cheek, better known as Dawg-Town DJ, is one of the seven musical acts that will be scattered throughout the race for the purpose of pumping up the runners and keep them motivated.


 


“I’m actually an athlete myself; I do half marathons and triathlons,” Cheek said. “I won’t be able to run the actual race, but I still want to run and participate and help them raise some [money] for the AthFest foundation.”But musicians and yearly participants are not the only people signing up to be virtual runners. Helme said a wide variety of people from a vast background of athletic backgrounds have chosen the virtual route for this year.“We had a college student who signed up for the virtual race because he was trying to get his mother to be more physically active,” Helme said. “So he signed himself and mother up for the virtual race with the goal that he would be able to keep her motivated.”Helme said the program is perfect for people looking to get active, because there is no required time limit to complete the race in when running virtually.“When you run the actual race day, there is a time limit to have completed the race in four hours because we have to open the streets. When you do the virtual race, that time limit isn’t there.”",Zach Hansen @zach_ehansen,variety,https://www.redandblack.com/variety/athhalf-enters-th-year-adds-virtual-runner-program/article_c96eb14c-78ec-11e5-ae58-afdd7cac9b30.html

29-Oct-15,Q&A;: Athens nurse discusses importance of Breast Cancer Awareness Month,"On average, 70,000 people between the ages of 15 and 39 are diagnosed with cancer each year, according to the National Cancer Institute.And 15 percent of the cancer diagnoses in this age group are breast cancer, the Young Survival Coalition, an organization supporting women under age 40 with breast cancer, said.    Sandy Pyle, an RN oncology nurse navigator from the Loran Smith Center for Cancer Support in Athens, said it is important for all females, young and old, to be aware of changes in their breasts.


 


About 80 percent of young women diagnosed with breast cancer find breast abnormalities on their own, according to the Young Survival Coalition.   “Know yourself, know your body, know your breasts at an early age so that you can monitor and know of any changes that might occur,” Pyle said. In October, which is Breast Cancer Awareness Month, several events were held in Athens to raise awareness and support for women with breast cancer.The awareness kicked off on Friday, Oct. 2 when the University of Georgia Ice Dawgs wore pink jerseys to recognize the month.From there, events such as the Fit for a Cure 5K in Commerce and the Hunt for Hope, a scavenger hunt that raises money for One Day of Mammograms - a free day of mammograms at Athens hospitals - occurred throughout October.And on Saturday, Oct. 24, 150 walkers gather for the 13.1 In Their Shoes walk, which raises money for the Loran Smith Center for Cancer Support.The walk raised $180,000 and expects a record $200,000 as its total after post-race donations occur through mid-November, said Tammy Gilland, vice president for the Athens Regional Foundation. In an interview with the Red & Black, Pyle, who works with survivors at the Loran Smith Center, explains why the In Their Shoes Walk is important for breast cancer and how breast cancer affects college-aged females.  


 


Red & Black: Why is the In Their Shoes walk important?Sandy Pyle: The walk isn’t to support breast cancer, but to support the Loran Smith Center for Cancer Support and all of our programs. Our mission is to provide information, education and support to anybody in the community who is touched by cancer, so obviously a lot of the people that we see are breast cancer survivors.Specifically for breast cancer, we offer a class on hormonal therapies for women….We also have classes like yoga for breast cancer. It’s taught by a yoga instructor who understands the issues that women who have had breast cancer face….And we are just about to start our second breast cancer support group. Our first group had just gotten so big that we decided we needed to split it into two separate support groups.R&B: What is the breast cancer support group at the Loran Smith Center?SP: One of our members calls it a place where she can take off her pink cape and just say what is on her mind because perhaps there are things you are not comfortable saying to your friends or family because as a woman you want to put up a big front and show how strong you are. This is where you can let your fears be expressed. R&B: What are the typical ages of people that come to your support group?SP: Breast cancer most often occurs in those 55 and older. However, having said that, we also have young women who are in the group…those who are in their 30s or 40s.R&B: What are some of the warning signs women should know?


TNCMS.AdManager.render({region: 'fixed-big-ad-bottom-asset', slot: 1, fold: ""below""});


SP: Know your body, know any changes, anything that is different. Unfortunately with breast cancer there can be no warning sign. That is why screening is so important. And know your family history. Do you have a close relative that has had breast cancer, whether they are male or female? That increases your chance of breast cancer….A swelling, lump, redness or warmth, even swelling up into your armpit, typically those things you will associate with an infection; however, they can be a sign of breast cancer….A change in your nipple. If you nipple gets retracted in, usually that is not something that is normal, it needs to be checked out. Drainage from the breast that is not breast milk. Anything like that absolutely needs to be checked out.And don’t wait on it. That is the real key not to wait. Unfortunately a lot of women due to fear won’t have these things checked out and that can be a real problem.R&B: Are there differences in how breast cancer affects the body of a younger woman compared to an older woman?SP: Unfortunately in younger women, the cancer can be much more aggressive because cancer is typically very slow growing which is why you see it in women who are 55 and older….It can be harder to treat, so it can grow faster or be at a higher stage, which has a less favorable prognosis. But, I will say, younger women tend to be more resilient and healthier and can bounce back from the treatments and the surgeries more quickly.R&B: Does the busy lifestyle of most college-aged females impact how breast cancer would affect their bodies?SP: Certainly, [college students] might overlook something or ignore something or not have it checked out. The longer you put it of, again since it is typically more aggressive, it can certainly grow faster or be harder to treat….If your mother had breast cancer, especially if she had breast cancer at an early age, you need to be all over it and be very cognizant and aware of your body and make sure you get your annual screenings, but then you need to just be able to live your life and not be worrying about it constantly.R&B: How often should women screen for breast cancer?SP: The standards are age 40 for your first mammogram and then every year there after. Certainly if you have a family history though, you should get a clinical breast exam, meaning a doctor, your nurse practitioner or a gynecologist should check your breasts on an annual basis. They are trained to do a specific type of exam and know exactly what they are looking for. Young women themselves should know what their breasts feel like, know what they look like and watch for any change. If they notice something, that is the time to take action and see your clinician for a follow-up.

30-Oct-15,15 non-traditional songs to add to your Halloween playlist,"As college students, we’ve approached the age where “Monster Mash,” “Thriller” and the “Scooby Doo, Where Are You?” theme song aren’t much more than funny party gags.If you want to throw a truly successfully Halloween party, there needs to be a playlist with some more depth.To help curate the perfect holiday party with the perfect soundtrack, here is a spooky playlist that provides a little extra bass, personality and age appropriate musical genres.


 


Tyler, The Creator -  “Yonkers”The playlist starts off with the skin-crawling Tyler the Creator track “Yonkers.” To add to the song’s creepy aura, its infamous music video features the rapper eating a cockroach and eventually hanging himself. The beat is just as ominous as Tyler’s aggressive lyrics, and will put anyone into a dark Halloween mood.Kanye West – “Monster”Further into the playlist, we have Kanye West’s head-bobbing single from 2010’s “My Beautiful Dark Twisty Fantasy,” which features Rick Ross, Jay Z and Nicki Minaj. All four artists go into explicit detail when describing their monster-like tendencies, while the chorus refrains the words, “Everybody know I’m a mother****** monster.” Kanye and Jay absolutely kill the track, but Nikki turns out to be the true monster. Her hysterical split personality was born for this song, and she spits the undisputable best verse on the track.Reptar – “Ghost Bike”Midway through the musical lineup, native Athens band Reptar makes an appearance with its song “Ghost Bike” from the album “Body Faucet.” As a slower song, the worrying track serves as a nice intermission from more powerful anthems like “Spitting Venom” by Modest Mouse and “Cry like a Ghost” by Passion Pit, which appear elsewhere on the playlist.Twin Shadow -  “At My Heels”Another song with both eerie and melodic elements is “At My Heels,” by Brooklyn artist Twin Shadow from his 2010 album “Forget.” The track tells a story of a man attempting to escape from a pursing ghost. The quick syncopated drumbeat acts as the fleeting feet while worrying electric guitar riffs lurk along.


 


Wild Cub - “Hidden in the Night”To tie the playlist together, we conclude with “Hidden in the Night,” a popular tune form Nashville-based band Wild Cub. The song is off the group’s debut album, “Youth,” which was released in 2012. “Hidden in the Night” is the grooviest of the Halloween bangers, and it makes for a perfect dancing song, as the overpowering bass line inspires listeners to bob back and forth. The track interjects random electronic pitches and semi-tropic marimba measures, deeming it a perfect ending for an oddball Halloween party. Check out the full playlist via Spotify below:",Wes Jones @who_wesjones,variety,https://www.redandblack.com/variety/non-traditional-songs-to-add-to-your-halloween-playlist/article_04a37d72-7e8f-11e5-97e1-2fccfd920d50.html

From athletes to electric buses, The Red & Black complied five of the top stories not to miss this week.1. UGA to offer degree program for students with disabilitiesIn spring 2017, the University of Georgia will launch an inclusive post-secondary education program called Destination Dawgs.


 


The program aims to give young adults with intellectual or developmental disabilities access to a college experience and build the skills they need to transition into adult life.2. Campus Transit experiments with electric busesThe University of Georgia is testing several models of electric buses on campus. In June, Campus Transit, with the help of the Office of Sustainability, applied for a $10.5 million federal grant to fund the investment. Electric vehicles require more upfront costs, but over the life of the vehicles electric buses cost less than diesel buses.3. UGA launches campus climate surveyThe Office of Institutional Diversity has launched its campus climate survey titled “Count Me In” for students to voice their opinions on what it is like to live, learn and work as part of the UGA community. This is the first time UGA has conducted an institution-level survey. UGA will release a report and hold public meetings on the findings in early spring.4. Athletes featured in NO MORE campaign videoUGA Athletics recently released a promotional video as a part of NO MORE, a campaign bringing awareness to sexual assault and domestic violence. The video features a variety of athletes, including football players Nick Chubb and Grayson Lambert, as well as several members of the gymnastics, swimming and diving and cross country teams.5. Henry Louis Gates speaks on genealogy, race and genetics

19-Nov-15,"University Council discusses Destination Dawgs, student population increase","The last University Council meeting of the semester took place Wednesday afternoon with several positive announcements about the University of Georgia’s accomplishments.Johnelle Simpson, Student Government Association president, said to the council that has been successful since its launch, especially with its ability to ask for a ride through an app.However, he said he hopes it will become even more successful so they can completely eliminate late night buses.


 


“I talked to the Gotcha CEO last week, and we’re somewhere between 250 to 300 rides a week,” Simpson said. “We’re looking at increasing those numbers. My hope is that we can eliminate our night buses and go all electric for nighttime.”Another project in the works that Simpson talked about was Destination Dawgs, created by SGA Treasurer Darby Miller.The program seeks to help those with disabilities come to UGA, Simpson said, in an effort to make post-secondary education more inclusive.“This is a program that will allow students with intellectual and developmental disabilities the opportunity to come to the University of Georgia,"" he said. ""We’re looking at a Spring 2017 launch of that program with the help of College of Family and Consumer Sciences and J.W. Fanning Institute for Leadership Development.""President Jere Morehead gave his report and announced that the UGA student population had grown by 2 percent from last year.When looking at it from college to college, one in particular had large gains of students.“Some of our biggest gains came from the College of Engineering, where he had nearly 300 new students,” Morehead said. “Dean Leo and his faculty and staff are certainly to be commended for all of the work they're doing in attracting students to that rapidly expanding college at our institution.”Morehead also put the spotlight on two new administrative hires.


 


The first of those hires is Karri Hobson-Pape as the new vice president for marketing and communications. Morehead said with her new hire comes a new office, Division of Marketing and Communications, formerly known as Division of Public Affairs.Arthur Tripp, the second hire and a former UGA student, took on a position in the President’s Office as assistant to the president.“Arthur just finished his first week with us, but he’s no stranger to UGA,” Morehead said. “He was an active student leader during his time here as an undergraduate student. Arthur will be providing staff support to me in the very important areas of diversity, student relations and staff relations.”There were a few proposals given by William Vencil, chair of the University Curriculum Committee, which were all approved.Those approved proposals included terminating the major in Germanic and Slavic languages, adding a new minor in atmospheric sciences, adding two new minors in public policy and management and human services and approving the new Center for Vaccines and Immunology.",Katelyn Umholtz @Kumh0ltz,uganews,https://www.redandblack.com/uganews/university-council-discusses-destination-dawgs-student-population-increase/article_d16562a0-8ed2-11e5-9e62-ef1c1e8ce50d.html
22-Nov-15,"Godwin's role expands, offensive play calling goes back to the basics","A few weeks ago, Terry Godwin was the focus of Georgia’s offense, taking several snaps out of the wildcat formation. In Georgia’s overtime 23-17 win against Georgia Southern, it was his catching ability that shined. “As I come out of my break, Coach [Bryan] McClendon always says get your head around and as the ball came in the air, either you catch it or nobody catches it,” the freshman receiver said.” “And that’s what I did.”


 


 Godwin’s role in the offense, whether it has been taking snaps from the shotgun at quarterback or being targeted at receiver, has steadily increased over the past few weeks, something that has been a conscientious decision on the part of the offense. Godwin says that offensive coordinator Brian Schottenheimer approached him and told him that he was “going to put a lot on my plate,” and asked Godwin if he would be able to handle it. Godwin’s immediate answer was that he would. Georgia has had success moving the ball in the wildcat over the past month, often using it as a supplement for the offense when it stalls otherwise. Godwin has often been the player in which this scheme was built around. However, against Georgia Southern, this was not the case. “We definitely practice [the wildcat] a lot, almost having a whole period at practice running those plays and making sure we’ve got it down,” junior quarterback Greyson Lambert said. “We just run the plays throughout the game we think will work. We definitely came in here with a package, but we didn’t run it as much.” Lambert said that because Georgia Southern plays a lot of man coverage, the focus was more on trying to get the team’s skill players in space one-on-one to try to take advantage. This limits the wildcat, which can often be used to exploit weak spots in a zone defense. Georgia Southern also got creative on defense—something senior lineman John Theus said made the team adjust on the fly. “They ran a lot of blitzes and stunts and stuff that we had to make adjustments to that made it difficult and they provided a lot of pressure,” Theus said. In short, Georgia Southern made the Bulldogs stick to largely traditional playcalling. In a game where Georgia was forced to do things it has struggled with throughout the season, for at least one night, it worked out in their favor.","Evan Greenberg

1-Dec-15,Oakland basketball is close to home for two Georgia players,"Forwards Yante Maten and Mike Edwards both grew up in the state of Michigan. Not only that, but both grew up within 45 minutes of the Oakland University campus in Auburn Hills, Michigan.Tonight both players didn’t have to make the short trek over to Athletics Center O’rena where the Oakland basketball team plays. Tonight the Golden Grizzles made the 12 and a half hour drive to play the two Georgia big men that helped the Bulldogs beat the team from their native state.  “It feels great to get a win against a team from Michigan,” Maten, a sophomore from Pontiac Michigan said. “A lot of my friends were telling me about this game so it’s always good to get a win against a team from your home state.”


 


Maten who grew up a mere five minutes from the Oakland campus he said he used to go watch Oakland basketball as a kid.“I went and watched them a couple of times when I was younger,” Maten said. “But when high school rolled around and I was traveling a lot I didn’t get a chance too.”Not only did he get to play against the coach he used to watch in the stands, but he also led Georgia to a 86-82 victory over the Golden Grizzles. Maten matched his career night against Seton Hall with 21 points and added nine rebounds (six of them offensive) and three blocks to go along with it.In the first half he continued to show off his post moves that he had been working on in the offseason. Six of his ten first half points started with him receiving the ball with his back to the basket. His biggest contribution to the Georgia victory came in the second half when knocked down the game winning free throws with 30 seconds remaining.“Both me and [Edwards] have history in Michigan so it was nice to get this win,” Maten said.Edwards, who grew up 45 minutes away from Oakland University in Westland Mich. had a career night himself against several familiar faces. The freshman had a career high 14 points along with six rebounds against a couple of players he played on the same team with.“I played on the same high school team with number two Nick Daniels and the same summer team with number 20 Kay Felder,” Edwards said.He also had a similar sentiment to Maten’s joy with a win against his former state. With a big grin on his face he said it was fun beating some of the Oakland players that were his teammates in high school.


 


“It makes me feel even better that I had my best game against some of them,” Edwards said. “I am definitely going to rub it in their faces.”","Alex Makrides

3-Dec-15,"Eason come, Eason go: Richt departure leaves 5-star quarterback's commitment in doubt","It was a trip he made on his own accord.After Georgia’s game against Auburn on Nov. 24, former Georgia head coach Mark Richt took a trip to Lake Stevens, Washington, the hometown of Lake Stevens High School quarterback and five-star recruit Jacob Eason. The reason, Richt said in his teleconference the following Sunday, was to enjoy each other’s company.Did his tune change after his dismissal from Georgia football? Nope.


 


“The message was to basically go in there and enjoy each other’s company, No. 1,” Richt said on Monday. “And No. 2 was get ready to play some ball for the Dogs.”Georgia’s third and final loss of the regular season came to Florida on the last day in October. Since then, the former head coach’s job was suspected to be in limbo. Because of the timing, the trip to Washington carried with it the weight of warning.Eason is ranked within the top 10 of all 2016 recruits by most recruiting sites, within the top three in rankings of the nation’s pro-style quarterbacks and is a huge piece of Georgia’s recruiting class.Not even Richt denies that.What Richt has neither confirmed nor denied is whether or not his visit to Eason, back in November, was to brace Georgia’s touted recruit for the oncoming cyclone of attention Richt’s job status was about to endure.Richt talked to Eason on Sunday after news of his dismissal from Georgia football broke.“I said, ‘Be patient,’” Richt said. “I said, ‘See who that next guy is and you might get really excited about that and then the rest of the guys might get really excited about that.’”Those other guys Richt mentioned are the 16 other commits and handful of potential signees following suit, prepared to join the team alongside Georgia’s projected epicenter under center. The fear is if Eason should flip on his commitment to the Georgia football program, others will follow suit.


 


Reports circulated the Internet on Monday saying Eason made a trip to visit the University of Florida’s campus. Not only does this bode poorly for Georgia, but it’s a gutsy move for Florida. The Gators have a four-star quarterback commit named Feleipe Franks.How would you feel if the school you committed to entertained the idea of flipping a different quarterback from a rival? Franks said it best: not good.So Florida is taking a risk on Eason, but what risks is Georgia taking? Georgia’s athletic director Greg McGarity said he was unsure exactly who was on the road recruiting in Richt’s stead. That’s not necessarily the answer Georgia fans hoped for.But, either way, Richt didn’t seem to be worried on Monday.“I’m not saying don’t check out other options or be proactive, but don’t jump the gun,” Richt said of Eason. “You chose Georgia for a reason, and it was more than just me, or coach Schottenheimer or whatever it may be.”Jacob Eason and his father Tony Eason could not be reached for comment by The Red & Black following Richt’s firing.Jacob Eason confirmed his Florida visit on social media Tuesday, tweeting, “Landed in Gainsville looking forward to checking out the swamp,” followed by a classic gator emoji — a Georgia fan’s worst nightmare.Jacob Eason might be searching for a new school to take up the scepter and lead. According to Richt, Eason is already a leader a Georgia; that responsibility was thrust upon him the moment he signed his financial aid papers.

“It was just a matter of knowing that he is a very important part of the recruiting class,” Richt said. “When you have a quarterback commit early, you ask him to lead, already. You not here yet, but you can lead by helping build your class, and I think he’s done a great job of that.”","Taylor Denman

3-Dec-15,"Mark Richt will not coach UGA's bowl game, McClendon to serve as interim","The Mark Richt era at UGA is officially over.Despite indications early in the week that Richt would remain in Athens through bowl season, UGA confirmed Thursday afternoon that Richt will not serve as the Bulldogs' head coach in whichever bowl they are invited to. In his stead, wide receivers coach and longtime UGA assistant Bryan McClendon will serve as interim head coach.McClendon is in his first year as wide receivers coach after he spent 2009-2014 as UGA's running backs coach. McClendon has also been Georgia's recruiting coordinator since 2014 and earned the title of assistant head coach as well. 


 


Prior to becoming a coach, McClendon played four season as a Bulldog. He was a four-time letter winning wide receiver from 2002-2005, during which period he and his teammates won two Southeastern Conference titles.J. Reid Parker Director of Athletics Greg McGarity, who named McClendon as interim coach, indicated in a release that aside from McClendon moving up on the totem pole, no other coaches will move positions prior to the bowl, including offensive coordinator Brian Schottenheimer and defensive coordinator Jeremy Pruitt.""I've asked Bryan to assume all administrative duties of the head coach,"" McGarity said. ""This will be the least disruptive option for our players and staff as they begin preparations for our bowl game.""The news of McClendon coaching UGA during bowl season comes with little surprise as reports surfaced Wednesday night that Richt is likely to be named the next head coach at the University of Miami, his alma mater. Richt has not been officially announced as Miami's next head coach, but the Hurricanes' official twitter account indicated Thursday that the school's next head coach will be announced Friday at 10 a.m.","Staff Reports

7-Dec-15,"Smart makes trip to Washington, discusses his philosophy for in-state recruiting","It is not yet clear who will remain on Georgia football's coaching staff under head coach Kirby Smart and which coaches could potentially be brought on, but recruiting will be affected.It already has been.Since Mark Richt was officially fired on Nov. 29, the drama of Georgia football recruiting has been a sort of wreck that UGA Athletics is trying to salvage before its list of 16 hard commitments dwindles.


 


Smart said, following his news conference in Athens on Monday, he was already making a trip to Washington to visit Georgia's five-star quarterback commitment, Jacob Eason.Smart's strategy to keep his current commitments satified, he stated, is the simple concept of honesty. ""[I'll] be up front,"" Smart said. ""There is change going on and change is inevitable. I think it's really important they understand that, and it's important they get to know me.""Coaching staff will have some play in which high school prospects stay and which leave. Smart's soon-to-be-former boss Nick Saban surrounded himself with great recruiters, including Smart himself.The dead period for recruiting starts on Monday Dec. 14, and Smart said he likely won't finalize his staff or make any big hires until after Georgia's bowl game and the conclusion of Alabama's College Football Playoff run.Until Smart returns to Tuscaloosa in a week, he will be on the road. As he mulls over the potential staff, Smart says recruiting will be an important play in who he decides to hire.""I've tried to assemble the best staff possible to go out and get as much depth and good players as we can in recruiting,"" Smart said. ""Make sure those are the right kind of student-athletes that will make right choices and decisions when they get here."" Thirteen of Georgia's 16 hard commitments hail from the state of Georgia, and the 2016 class is still fluid especially in the near the top. While Smart has a grand focus on the five-star recruit on the west coast, he can't lose sight of the talent in his own state.


 


According to Smart, Georgia is playing a game of precision with regards to in-state recruiting. Nail down the top talent, the kids down the street and the childhood fans. Make the University of Georgia, a state ripe for Southeastern Conference prospects, a destination for young Georgia high schoolers.""You're not going to keep every great player in this state,"" Smart said. ""It's not going to happen. It's a transient state. It's tough to recruit in because everybody comes in here to get their players. You have to do a thorough job. You have to get the ones you should get. I think there's a lot of great players in this state.""","Taylor Denman

12-Dec-15,"5 Things to Know: Kirby Smart answers first questions as head coach, deans compete for College of Agricultural and Environmental Sciences","A lot goes on around campus, and sometimes it's hard to keep up with. From Kirby Smart to dean finalists, The Red & Black complied five of the top stories not to miss this week.1. Students participate sparsely on campus climate surveyThe “Count Me In” campus climate survey that ran from Oct. 20 to Nov. 20 hoped to collect response data from 30 percent of the university population but collected about 1,000 fewer responses by 48 hours before the end of the survey. Bill McDonald, dean of students, said the data will still be useful in assessing the climate of the university.


 


2. Kirby Smart answers questions in first press conference as head coach.On Dec. 7 Kirby Smart talked about what he wanted to see out of the football team at Georgia, what led him to this point, why he decided to leave Alabama and what the future holds for Georgia football.3. Universities include more gender pronoun options on applicationsUniversities such as Cornell University and the Michigan Institute of Technology are some of those starting to include more pronoun options in their applications. Others such as Boston University are contemplating the addition. Patrick Winter, the associate vice president for enrollment management, said the adjustment seemed unnecessary as UGA does not ask for preferred pronouns on its applications for admission nor is the information necessary to make an enrollment decision.4. Deans compete for position in College of Agricultural and Environmental SciencesKendall Lamkey, the first of five finalists for the position of dean of the College of Agricultural and Environmental Sciences, spoke Dec. 1 about his vision for agriculture in the state of Georgia and how the college would impact the state under his leadership. Gary Pierzynski, department head of agronomy at Kansas State University, also spoke on Dec. 3, and three more candidates will speak before the end of the semester.5. Former CNN president honors mentorCNN President Tom Johnson dedicated the Peyton Anderson Forum, a refurbished and redesigned space in the journalism building, to honor the mentor, Anderson, he credits with kickstarting his career. Johnson told students to seek out mentor relationships and said there are many men and women who would eagerly and proudly mentor them.

11-Jan-16,Gymdogs fall to No. 15 after loss in season opener,"Georgia gymnastics dropped from its No. 9 preseason rank to No. 15 after a 196.925-195.2 loss to Michigan on Jan. 9, according to Road to Nationals.  The Wolverines improved their No. 7 ranking to become tied at No. 1 with LSU. No team scored above a 197 (averaging a 9.85 per routine) in the first meet. Florida, Oklahoma and UCLA round out the top five, respectively. Georgia ranks sixth of the eight programs in the Southeastern Conference, ahead of Arkansas and Kentucky.NCAA gymnastics rankings derive solely from competition results, so for most teams this week’s rank is based on one meet. Only a couple teams have competed in two meets.


 


When broken down by event, the Gymdogs rank highest on bars where they are tied for sixth. On floor Georgia is seventh. After a few mistakes in the season opener, Georgia ranks No. 17 on vault and No. 40 on beam.After scoring a 9.9 on bars in her collegiate debut, freshman Sydney Snead is tied at No. 4 on bars. Snead is also tied at 13th on vault. With a 9.9 on floor, senior Mary Beth Box is tied at No. 10. Senior Brittany Rogers also landed in the top 20 individually as she finished the weekend tied at No. 15 on bars.This weekend Georgia will compete against No. 16 Arkansas on the road on Jan. 15 and against No. 22 Stanford at home on Jan. 18.","Emily Giambalvo

12-Jan-16,Charles Mann rotates starting spot for betterment of the Bulldogs,"Charles Mann has become a utility player for the Georgia men’s basketball team this year. In trying to limit the effects of key injuries early in the season, head coach Mark Fox singled out his senior to fill in Georgia’s missing gaps.Mann, who switched from point guard to shooting guard last year, has shuffled between all five positions this year. Although the team is finally getting healthy, Mann continues to be the do-it-all player for Georgia.“I am a basketball player, so it doesn’t matter where I play,” Mann said. “I need to do whatever I need to do to help my team win.”


 


In the season opener, Mann lined up against Chattanooga’s Justin Tuoyo at the five, then countered the big-man role in Georgia’s second game by starting at point guard. Mann took over for an injured Kenny Gaines at shooting guard against Winthrop and has since spent most of his playing time at small forward.Mann has also played all five positions in a single game, doing so against High Point when he moved around from the one to the five in 31 minutes of playing time.What stands out from his excursions from guard to forward to center and back to guard is how much it has affected his offensive output.“In fairness to him, he hasn’t found any rhythm because I have moved him around so much,” Fox said.Photo by Randy Schafer


 


Fox has advocated the use of his more experienced players during times when the team is short-handed or in need of leadership. Mann has seen an increase in minutes away from his traditional-ball handling position.“He’s had to play several different positions, which you don’t see anyone do,” Fox said. “You don’t see guys do that in the NBA. He has been so unselfish and wiling to do whatever we need and not complain one time.""His selfless nature has had a noticeable impact on his numbers this year.Through 13 games last season, Mann was shooting 45.6 percent from the field while averaging 12.3 points per game, 5.4 rebounds a game and 3.7 assists a game. While Mann is averaging the same number of minutes this season, his field-goal percentage has dropped to 34.8 percent and his points per game, rebounds per game and assists per game have fallen as well. Statistics have never been of a huge concern to Mann, but he has expressed frustration with what he sees as an inability to contribute adequately to his team.“I haven’t been in a rhythm this year but that is not an excuse,” Mann said. “I just got to try to make it better for these final games.”Fellow senior guard Kenny Gaines expressed his empathy for his teammate, saying he felt bad Mann is out of sync because he has been all over the floor this year. He admitted Mann has at times appeared to be a little overwhelmed.Gaines did say he's seen progress in Mann.


TNCMS.AdManager.render({region: 'fixed-big-ad-bottom-asset', slot: 1, fold: ""below""});


“Right now I think he is just trying to figure out from game to game which Charles he wants to be or he needs to be or which Charles coach needs him to be,” Gaines said.While he is figuring out how to handle each position, Mann said he was not going to give up his attack-first mentality.Yante Maten said he hasn’t noticed any difference in how Mann attacks the hoop.  What he has noticed, though, is Mann’s leadership role. Because of his transition from one through five, he has been able to enlighten all of his teammates as to the nuances of each role.“He has been going around to all of us and telling us what we need to do, especially the freshmen because he has been in all their spots,” Maten said.In trying to figure out ways to compliment his get-to-the-basket style, Mann said he focused on developing a jump shot. He said he worked on it in the summer, knowing teams would prevent him from driving the lane. Mann has gotten to the point where he is confident enough in his jump shot to be his first move towards the basket instead of putting the ball on the floor.Fox said it’s not about the numbers. He has been pleased with how Mann has contributed to Georgia. Although his isn’t putting up eye-popping statistics like in years past, Fox said Mann is doing the small things to help his team’s success.“[Mann] is impacting winning,"" Fox said.","Alex Makrides

16-Jan-16,Georgia swimming and diving adds another impressive recruiting class,"The football team isn’t the only Georgia squad that will head into next season with an impressive recruiting class.The Georgia swimming and diving team has a lot to look forward to thanks to its impressive start to its 2016-2017 recruiting class as well.For head coach Jack Bauerle, selling a school with six women’s national titles and a plethora of Southeastern Conference titles is not difficult. What is difficult is finding swimmers with not only fast times, but with good work ethics as well.


 


There are two qualities that Bauerle said he specifically looks for when recruiting swimmers.“Desire and character,” Bauerle said. “When you sit face to face with an athlete you can really get a feel for how much they want to be good. I also like to know how much they’d like to be here.""Besides looking for desire and character in a recruit, Bauerle likes to observe the relationship each recruit has with his or her parents.“The most important thing on the home visit for me is to see how they treat their mother and father,” Bauerle said. “If they’re not going to treat their mother and father well, they’re not going to treat me well. If they roll their eyes at things their parents say, we try to back out the driveway.”Photo by Randy Schafer


 


So far, 17 swimmers have signed their National Letter of Intent to join Bauerle and his staff in Athens for the fall. There are nine women and eight men who have signed their NLI. In addition, 10 of the 17 swimmers are from the state of Georgia.Having a large amount of in-state swimmers commit to Georgia is something that Bauerle said he enjoys seeing.“I think the local kids are the lifeline of our program,” Bauerle said. “I think they have another impetus to succeed if they’re from here. It’s a very, very good swimming state.” Although Bauerle is excited to have a large amount of in-state swimmers, he said that he has his eyes on two swimmers in particular heading into next season in Veronica Burchill from Indiana and Javier Acevedo from Scarborough, Ontario. “Burchill’s going to be a real player and I think she’ll expand her repertoire,” Bauerle said. “Acevedo is extremely talented and we don’t even know what he’s going to do best yet. I’m excited about all of them. All of the ones coming I’m anxious to see how they’ll do.”The complete list of 17 swimmers is Jordan Guille, Christian Lorys, Sandra Scott, Ben Walker, John Wesley, Katherine Aikens, Mary Claire Cardwell, Jackson Ford, Lexi Glunn, Clayton Forde, Walker Higgins, Joshua Horne, Meryn McCann, Katherine Parker, Jordan Stout, Acevedo and Burchill.","John Durham

16-Jan-16,Basketball notebook: Georgia registers season-low point total in blowout loss to Texas A&M;,"The Georgia men’s basketball team set a new season low for points in a game. Its 45 points was the worst mark by the Bulldogs since they scored 45 in a loss to Alabama in 2013.Georgia shot 28.3 percent in the game and only made 15 field goals over the course of 40 minutes.“Never were we able to find the ability to finish plays offensively,” Georgia head coach Mark Fox said.


 


Fox said he knew it would be a rough night offensively when he called a timeout early in the game and out of that timeout a couple of Georgia players ran a completely different play.“Mentally we were not there tonight, and I don’t know why that was,” Fox said.In the first half, Georgia shot 8-for-29 (27.6 percent) from the field and 2-for-10 (20 percent) from behind the arc.Georgia shooting 29% as it goes into the locker room with its largest halftime deficit of the season (15). A&M leads 38-23.— Alex Makrides (@amakrides00) January 16, 2016Twenty-three points also represents Georgia’s lowest halftime point total of the season.The scoring didn’t improve in the second half either. Georgia only managed to put up 22 points, which is its second lowest second-half point total of the season.“I just feel like we were all trying to make an impact,” senior Kenny Gaines said. “[The Aggies] were playing good defense , and [if] our shots are not falling, it can get a little ugly.”


 


And ugly it got. Georgia’s 34-point loss is its worst defeat since Mark Fox took over as head coach after the 2008-2009 season. Maten was to only player for Georgia to score in double figures and he still shot 4-for-13.“That’s as bad as we have had a team play in over a decade,” Fox said.Houston Kessler and the rest of the Bulldogs are shrugging their shoulders at this game. Georgia trails A&M 66-41 pic.twitter.com/4uGyruaYwx— Red & Black Sports (@redblacksports) January 16, 2016A&M’s length causes problems In its lowest offensive output this season, Georgia struggled just to get players open. On the offensive side of the ball, Texas A&M gave Georgia little room to operate its offense.It wasn’t that Georgia was missing open shots. Texas A&M forced the Bulldogs into difficult attempts, and when they did shoot, an Aggie hand was always in their faces.“They had some good size and it affected our shots,” Yante Maten said.


TNCMS.AdManager.render({region: 'fixed-big-ad-bottom-asset', slot: 1, fold: ""below""});


Maten, who was only 4-for-13 on the night, missed six shots from right under the rim. The whole game featured the sophomore doing battle with players who had a size advantage on him.When Derek Ogbeide exited the game, Maten, who stands at 6-foot-8 and weighs 240, matched up with Tyler Davis who has a two-inch and 25-pound advantage on Maten.Photo by Joshua L. JonesUndersized seemed to be the theme for Georgia, as almost every player matched up against a bigger body from Texas A&M. Anthony Collins guarding J.J. Frazier, Alex Caruso covering Kenny Gaines and Danuel House hounding Charles Mann all had a distinct size advantage on their Georgia counterparts.“It affected our rhythm a lot,” Gaines said. “We really struggled just moving the ball.”

Georgia wasn’t even able to locate easy passes. The Texas A&M defenders closed out on the Bulldog players so quickly they were not able to make good reads on the what the next move should be.Battle of the 34sAt the start of the game, fans awaited the highly-anticipated battle of the freshman 34s. On the Texas A&M sideline, center Tyler Davis looked over and prepared to do battle with Georgia’s Derek Ogbeide.Ogbeide (6-8;250) to make his 2nd career start today. He is matched up against A&M freshman Tyler Davis (6-10;265). It's the battle of 34's— Alex Makrides (@amakrides00) January 16, 2016As the game progressed, it became apparent that Davis’ extra two inches and 15 pounds gave him the advantage over his counterpart.Davis had the ability to back down Ogbeide deep into the post where he was able to plant his big body. Once he was fed the ball, he continually went up and over the smaller Georgia freshman several times.“If he gets position, it’s pretty much over,” Maten said. ""He is so big you can’t move him out.""","Alex Makrides

17-Jan-16,SEC struggles continue for Georgia basketball in loss to Alabama,"Georgia women’s basketball experienced foul trouble early against Alabama (13-5, 2-3) that provoked the Lady Bulldog’s downfall in a 64-50 loss, making its struggles in the Southeastern Conference continue to a 1-4 record.The Lady Bulldogs (13-5, 1-4) recorded a total of 24 fouls and 21 turnovers that allowed Alabama to spend more time with the basketball and increase their lead with ease.""Credit Alabama,"" Georgia head coach Joni Taylor said. ""They did a really good job of switching up their defense and keeping us off track, and I don't think we ever got into an offensive rhythm.""


 


Alabama managed 18 percent shooting from behind the arch while Georgia shot 47 percent and it still could not find the amount of offense it needed to pull ahead.An offensive explosion came from senior Shacobia Barbee, senior Tiaria Griffin and junior Pachis Roberts who combined for 42 of Georgia’s 50 points.Griffin tallied 19 points, Roberts notched 11 and Barbee collected her sixth double-double of the season with 12 points and 11 rebounds. It was a tight contention in the first half as the Crimson Tide held onto a 19-17 lead after the first quarter.And thanks to Griffin the Lady Bulldogs maintained a 15-13 lead for a few minutes before Alabama created a streak of their own. Once the second half began Alabama began to generate more space between their opponents to a 37-26 lead.Georgia’s defense heated up as well late in the third quarter as it held the home squad to just two points in 11 attempted shots.Even though the Lady Bulldogs pulled within one possession of the Crimson Tide in the second half of the game, Alabama maintained enough pressure to keep its lead and prevent Georgia from going ahead.

20-Jan-16,"Rapper Lecrae drops surprise mixtape, addresses socially conscious themes","Lecrae is quickly establishing himself as one of the best rappers in the game right now. That’s not within the category of Christian rap either; just one of the best in hip-hop. Period.Often labeled as a Christian rapper making Christian music—which the emcee has constantly taken issue with, he is now spitting some of the most socially conscious rap that not only touches upon religion, but politics, race relations and human trafficking.His style and production always followed the trends of the time, blending in to match his contemporaries even though he’s peddling a different message. This did leave his music sounding like generic trap sometimes, but with his 2012 album “Gravity,” he finally seemed to find his own sound to match his message. 2014’s “Anomaly” expanded on this further, providing introspective tracks surrounding topical issues in a concept album-esque fashion.


 


And now in 2016, he drops his third mixtape “Church Clothes 3” out of nowhere on Friday Jan. 15. While weaker than “Anomaly” overall, there are a few tracks that definitely stand out as career highlights.Similar to Kendrick Lamar’s last album “To Pimp a Butterfly,” Lecrae has a very clear message surrounding African American youth, gang violence and inequality. While Lamar prefers overarching metaphors and analogies to make his point, Lecrae is a lot more forthright and blunt with his thoughts and topics.The album highlight “Gangland” sounds like a track Lamar would release given the social commentary on the formation of gangs and their original role within the black community. The preceding track, “Freedom” also hits hard since it covers the very emotionally charged topic of human trafficking.Neither of these tracks comes across as overly preachy or overbearing since the subject matter is universal. While all listeners may not connect with his religious messages or motivations, his listeners will connect with a war against gang violence and sex slavery.The mixtape doesn’t work when Lecrae falls back into bad habits of trying way too hard to chase trends. Most of the latter half of the album has him saying lame brags like, “I’m hearin’ screams and they sayin’ we sold out/I’m hearin’ screams from the stands cause we sold out.” Brag tracks, while often filler, can be done well. Lecrae’s efforts should remain tackling bigger topics, not brag rap.“Church Clothes 3” does have some of the most diverse production Lecrae has ever spit over, which is especially impressive given that this is only a mixtape, not an album. However, the project would have been much stronger overall if it stuck to the theme of the first two tracks and expanded upon them instead of mostly abandoning deeper topics to impress middle-school Future and Migos fans.",Zach Hansen @zach_ehansen,culture,https://www.redandblack.com/culture/rapper-lecrae-drops-surprise-mixtape-addresses-socially-conscious-themes/article_0e864a2a-bf87-11e5-80e3-67cf5bcc0d12.html
20-Jan-16,Shacobia Barbee leads Southeastern Conference in rebounding despite shorter stature,"If you created a list of the tallest basketball players in the Southeastern Conference, your eyes would take some time to spot Georgia guard Shacobia Barbee.At 5-foot-10, she’s almost diminutive in comparison to many of her teammates and opponents. But measurements are not nearly as important in basketball as rebounds, and on that list, Barbee is right at the top.As of Jan. 19, Barbee’s 169 rebounds are more than anyone else in the SEC. She is the only player in the top five under six feet. In fact, she’s the only one of the five top SEC rebounders shorter than 6-foot-3.It would surprise most that Barbee racks up the boards like she does, but one person who is not shocked is Lady Bulldogs head coach Joni Taylor.“She’s got a huge basketball IQ and she’s got a nose for the ball,” Taylor said.Photo by Randy SchaferFellow guard Marjorie Butler sees many of the same qualities in Barbee as Taylor does. Butler has played with Barbee since both players were freshmen in 2012. She’s had a long time to watch and admire the way Barbee plays the game.“She influences her teammates and all of us on the court,"" Butler said. ""We feed off of her. She anticipates plays that other people can’t do.”Barbee’s intelligence shows up in more ways than one. In addition to topping the SEC in rebounds, Barbee is also fifth in the conference in assists per game and fourth in steals per game. She’s the only player in the conference to be ranked in the top five of all three categories. While knowledge of the game is instrumental in Barbee’s success, she also brings another key characteristic that everyone you ask brings up without fail: intensity.Photo by Randy SchaferWhether it be on offense or defense, Barbee brings the same vapid energy to every minute she plays.“She’s always aggressive,” guard Tiaria Griffin said. “She loves rebounding. She does the dirty work. It might not always show, but she lives for doing the dirty work.”Taylor had much of the same to say about Barbee's style.“It just comes down to want,” Taylor said. “Rebounding is about your effort and just going after the basketball. She knows that for us to be successful that’s something that she has to do.”If history is any indication, Taylor is right in her assumption that Georgia needs Barbee.Last year, on her way to what would have most likely been her third-straight selection to the SEC All-Defensive team, Barbee fractured her fibula against Tennessee. The injury caused her to miss the rest of the season, and the effects were felt immediately.Photo by Randy SchaferAfter starting the year 18-3 with Barbee in the lineup, the Lady Bulldogs declined sharply without her. The team finished the year with a 1-9 record. Georgia was fittingly knocked out of the SEC tournament by Tennessee, the same team the Lady Bulldogs were playing when Barbee went down. Barbee is back and is averaging more points per game, rebounds per game, assists per game, and steals per game than she was last year. If she can stay healthy, she’ll look to push Georgia further than the first round of the SEC tournament this go-round. What Barbee lacks in size, she clearly makes up in skill and intensity. She may not be one of the biggest players on the court, but for Georgia, she might be the key to returning to the NCAA Tournament.

20-Jan-16,Lady Bulldogs look to bounce back against Mississippi State,"The Georgia Lady Bulldogs basketball team will return home Thursday to play the Mississippi State Bulldogs in Stegeman Coliseum. It will be Georgia’s first home game following a two game road trip that saw the team go 1-1 against Florida and Alabama.It is a game Georgia needs to win, as the Lady Bulldogs find themselves in a hole in the Southeastern Conference with a 1-4 record. Things won't get easier for the struggling Lady Bulldogs either as they are matched up with one of the highest ranked opponents they have had to play this year. Mississippi State is currently ranked No. 10 in the AP top 25.Despite the tough matchup Georgia at least has the benefit of being at home, which has been a huge advantage so far this season. The Lady Bulldogs are 9-2 inside Stegeman Coliseum as opposed to being 3-3 in away games.


 


“Being at home in front of our crowd is a big advantage for us,” senior Marjorie Butler said. “In games here in the Southeastern Conference it can be a couple of possessions that make the difference in a game. Being able to have our home crowd here to support us. That’s huge, and I’m looking forward to it.”Georgia has its hands full as Mississippi State boasts one of the most talented rosters in the conference. The Bulldogs of Mississippi State are led by the SEC’s top scorer of the season, Victoria Vivians. Also on the roster are centers Teaira McCowan and Chinwe Okorie, who stand at 6’7” and 6’5"", which are both taller than anyone on Georgia’s team.Mississippi State’s height advantage is obviously going to cause issues in the paint both offensively and defensively, but Georgia head coach Joni Taylor believes her team has what it takes to matchup with the taller players.“We’ve got to just fight, not let them get two feet buried in the paint, do a great job of boxing out, and hopefully get them to come over our back,” Taylor said. “Offensively we’ve got to pull them away from the basket and make them actually guard us and not just stand in the paint.”The Lady Bulldogs will have the next few days to prepare for the game, and it will tip off on Thursday evening at 7 p.m. in Stegeman Coliseum.","Nathan Berg

20-Jan-16,Georgia edges Missouri for first road victory of the season,"Georgia earned its first road victory of the season against Missouri, but it wasn't quite as easy as the Bulldogs hoped it would be. The Bulldogs needed a strong second half from senior guard Kenny Gaines and junior guard J.J. Frazier to secure the victory.  The duo combined for 27 points and ignited a 13-0 run early in the second half that proved crucial in a 60-57 win.Despite the victory, Georgia (10-6, 3-3) struggled offensively for much of the night. The Bulldogs shot 39 percent from the field and relied on sophomore forward Yante Maten to carry the load. Maten scored 21 points and had 12 rebounds in the victory.  He also added six blocks en route to his seventh straight game in double figures. 


 


One key to the game was Georgia’s ability to rebound against Missouri (8-10, 1-4).  The Bulldogs out-rebounded the Tigers 43-32 and had 12 offensive rebounds.  This allowed Georgia to get second chances at the basket where they took advantage offensively.  Junior forward Houston Kessler set the tone with four offensive rebounds on the night. Kessler played a big role and was on the floor late in the game. He played 23 minutes opposite Maten after a game-time decision by Georgia head coach Mark Fox did not prove fruitful. Fox started Mike Edwards over fellow freshman Derek Ogbeide. Edwards wasn’t effective and only played 12 minutes.  Ogbeide wasn’t much better, as he only scored two points in nine minutes.Neither found a rhythm, so Fox went with Kessler down the stretch. Defensively, Maten and Kessler were the more effective duo. They provided length against a young Missouri team. Both players held Tigers freshman Kevin Puryear to 10 points. As a team, Missouri was held to 35 percent shooting. Georgia returns home on Saturday to face the Arkansas Razorbacks.","Jaylon Thompson

20-Jan-16,Georgia basketball witnesses increase in 3-point shooting,"J.J. Frazier dribbled up the court, crossed up a defender so badly the foe fell on his backside and dropped a bucket from about five feet behind the 3-point line.This has been a familiar scene for the Georgia men’s basketball team in its successful showings in 2016. Not Frazier’s fancy footwork — that has been on display all season — but Georgia’s ability to make 3-pointers.In a three-game stretch from Jan. 6 to Jan. 13, Georgia averaged 10 made 3-pointers and shot 53.5 percent from behind the arc. In the previous six games, Georgia only had 4.3 triples per game with a 3-point shooting percentage of 30 percent.


 


The 3-point shot has become a major weapon in Georgia’s arsenal. According to forward Kenny Paul Geno, it’s because the offense has become much more fluid. Instead of attempting difficult shots, the Georgia players have been more prone to look for the open man, who just so happens to be behind the arc.“When we have open shots, we have great shooters who are full of confidence and will take those shots,” Geno said.In Georgia’s game against Tennessee on Jan. 13, guard Charles Mann drove the ball through the paint and got as far as the foul line before being engulfed by Volunteers defenders. Instead of pushing his way toward the basket, he picked up his dribble, found Kenny Gaines open at the top of the key, and launched the ball his way. Gaines knocked down a wide-open 3-pointer in a game highlighted by 12 such shots from the Bulldogs. Geno said he felt much of the production from deep is a result of Georgia’s two best shooters, Gaines and Frazier, hitting their shooting strides. The two guards have combined for 74.2 percent of Georgia’s made 3s this season. In those three games, both made just under one-third of their total 3-pointers.“They have always hit the big shot for us,” Geno said. “We have so much confidence in them to hit anything they take.”But the 3-point frenzy hasn’t come without some problems.In Georgia’s game against Texas A&M on Jan. 16, the Aggies eliminated the Bulldogs’ success from deep. For a majority of A&M’s 79-45 victory, it played a defense in which limited Georgia’s open looks from 3-point range. Nearly every shot that went up from a Bulldogs player featured intense pressure from the opposition.The Aggies’ defensive prowess shattered the Bulldogs’ 3-point shooting. The Bulldogs went 4-of-18 from 3, its worst mark since the loss to Florida on Jan. 2.


 


Georgia head coach Mark Fox said the increase in attempted 3-pointers has manifested from one player who is not a guard. Prior to Wednesday’s game against Missouri, sophomore forward Yante Maten led the team with 15.9 points per game thanks to a 53.4 field-goal percentage. Maten’s ability in the post has forced defenses to concentrate more on him, which opens up the 3-point line for teammates like Frazier and Gaines.“Yante [Maten] is drawing a lot of attention on the interior and we are taking the right 3s off that,” Fox said. “Hopefully we are making enough 3s though to reopen some space for [Maten].”Even Mann, who is known as a driving guard, is hopping on the 3-point bandwagon. Mann said he focused on developing his outside shot during the summer, and it has shown. Prior to Wednesday showdown with the Tigers, he has hit 50 percent of his 3s this year. Mann cautioned that Georgia cannot become a team that lives and dies by the 3-ball. He said Georgia needs to work the ball into the post and attack the basket. The loss to Texas A&M proved that taking a great deal of shots behind the arc becomes problematic when those shots stop hitting their target.“We have been fairly good at 3-pointers but we can’t fall in love with that,” Mann said. “We have to continue to work our way towards the basket because that’s how you get those open looks.”","Alex Makrides

21-Jan-16,5 Minutes with SGA President Johnelle Simpson: Looking forward to spring 2016,"As the University of Georgia community picks up speed during its second full week of classes, The Red & Black sat down with Student Government Association President Johnelle Simpson to find out what students can expect from SGA during the semester.  The Red&Black: What are some of SGA’s most exciting upcoming events?Johnelle Simpson: We have elections of course, which are always a pretty big event ... Another big event that we do in the spring is Professor Recognition Reception ... It’s a great way to say thanks to our faculty who are going above and beyond their call of duty ... Students can begin nomination [of their favorite professors] next month. The Majors Fair is also coming up soon, and we are really encouraging those students who don’t know what they want their major to be to come out to the Majors Fair.


 


R&B: What issues will SGA focus on?JS: We plan this year to continue addressing the topic of downtown discrimination. One of our best platform points is inclusive post-secondary education...meaning that it is a program that will allow students with intellectual and developmental disabilities to come to UGA. There is a lot of work that is currently being done at the state level about that. Here on campus we have Destination Dawgs. [The university] is looking for the first students to come in the spring of 2017.R&B: How can students get involved in the upcoming SGA election?JS: The biggest way to get involved is to run in the election. There are a lot of Senate seats available, and there are the other positions like president and vice president that you can also run for, but of course that is a ticketed process. You have to have three people to run with.The second way that you can get involved is to work on someone’s campaign. A lot of people have found that by working on a campaign, they continue to stay involved in SGA. The third way to get involved is to vote. We don’t always have a big turnout here at UGA. A little over 2,000 students voted last year, but I think that those numbers could get much bigger in the upcoming elections.R&B: Looking back at your time as president, what are you most proud of having accomplished through SGA?JS: The GOTCHA Ride program. Last semester we were around 250 to 300 rides per week, and that’s a lot compared to the 20 rides a week ... that were reported in previous years. I think that we’ve gotten off to a good start. Now the biggest thing is for students to understand that in order for a program like GOTCHA to continue, it has to be utilized. We have done some improvements to the app to eliminate some of the initial bugs, and we hope that that will encourage students to utilize the service more.","Kate Huller

21-Jan-16,Caliya Robinson shows off arm strength twice in Lady Bulldogs' upset win,"Georgia freshman Caliya Robinson displayed such a strong arm on Thursday night that Kirby Smart may come calling soon.Senior Shacobia Barbee ran a slant down court as Robinson threw the basketball the length of the court into her hands in Georgia’s 47-43 upset over No. 10 Mississippi State.Barbee received the pass and jumped for the easy layup but was fouled along the way, providing the opportunity for a 3-point play.


 


“We might just have to talk to the football coach and get her out there as quarterback,” Barbee said.And it wasn’t just a one-time occurrence.Robinson had a total of two assists the whole game. Both were the result of long passes to Barbee, allowing her to add onto Georgia’s lead.The Lady Bulldogs shot 38 percent (3-of-8) from the free-throw line in the second half when the key passes took place. The three made free throws came from Barbee capitalizing on Robinson’s lobs.“It’s a designed play,” Robinson said. “I’m just glad she’s catching them.”The passes weren’t the only integral pieces of offense the two provided. Both combined for 26 of Georgia’s 47 total points, with Barbee tallying 17 points and Robinson notching nine.Head coach Joni Taylor said the passes have always been a part of their offensive package. Georgia was just waiting for the right time to use it.“We don’t use it unless we have to when people aren’t ready for it,” Taylor said. “Mississippi State was a team we knew that was going to pressure us the length of the floor the entire game. We put it in our pocket and took advantage of it late in the game.”

21-Jan-16,Lady Bulldogs credit fans for help in upending Mississippi State,"Georgia women’s basketball head coach Joni Taylor gazed into the crowd during the second half and saw senior Marjorie Butler’s face.There was just one problem: Butler was on the court.“I looked up one time and Marjorie was staring at me,” Taylor said. “I was like, ‘what’s going on?’”


 


Throughout the game, the Georgia fans in attendance made sure their presence was felt.They even went out of the way to ensure they would be noticed. Some fans brought blown-up replicas of players' heads, such as senior Shacobia Barbee, senior Tiaria Griffin and Butler.The Georgia fans did everything in their power to distract Mississippi State.When the opponents were sent to the free-throw line, the heads floated around in the crowd. The Bulldogs of Mississippi State were held to just 58 percent (7-of-12) from the line.The Georgia players said they enjoyed the unusual sight and mentioned that it gave them the proper support they needed.“When the crowd gets in it, that’s when we get up,” freshman Caliya Robinson said. “It frustrates the other team and it helps us. I think we did a great job, and I think the crowd helped us do that.”For Taylor, the wins mean just as much to her team as they do to their fans. She said she looks forward to what more comes from the faces in the crowd.“They’re so loyal,"" Taylor said. ""Good or bad they’re there. I’m excited for them, and I know they’ll come out again Sunday.”

22-Jan-16,Restaurants vie for the title of best Athens breakfast,"With breakfast being the most important meal of the day, choosing a brunch spot is equally as important. Thankfully, Athens is home to many well-known and highly praised breakfast locations. The real question is which is the best.And what even makes a breakfast spot “the best?” Is it the delicious food? The unique atmosphere? The timeliness?Elana Munroe-Gregory, the café manager of Big City Bread, believes what makes the café the best place to stop by for breakfast is the freshness of the food. 


 


“We make all of our biscuits and breads and pastries and all that kind of stuff from scratch in house daily,” Munroe-Gregory said. David Asman, the owner of Athens Bagel Co., located in downtown Athens, has a similar opinion about his own establishment.“We’re one of only two places in town that truly makes a real New York-style bagel fresh and in-house every single day,” Asman said.Both places strive to provide the freshest food for their customers, making both of them great places to grab a bite to eat.As indicated by their resaurant name, Athens Bagel Co. specializes mostly in bagels, such as bagel sandwiches, bagels topped with cream cheese and, one of Asman’s favorites, their ""Bagel Brei,"" a French toast made out of bagels.Regarding the uniqueness of Athens Bagel Company, Asman said, “Some of the other places in Athens like Big City Bread and Ike & Jane will put out some bagels every now and then, but they’re not doing it every day.”While Athens Bagel Co. focuses on the homemade bagels, Big City Bread and Mama’s Boy claim biscuits to be their specialty.When asked what the most popular menu items at Mama’s Boy are, co-owner Cooper Hudson listed many of the restaurant’s special crowd-pleasers. However, she admitted the biscuits were the best.


 


“The bacon, egg and cheese scrambler is the most popular one, and the vegetable scrambler is right behind it. And then I think it’s the pulled pork and potato hash,” Hudson said. “And all those come with a biscuit. So probably if you ask what the most popular thing is, it’d be the biscuits.”And popular they are. In a poll The Red & Black conducted on Twitter, Mama’s Boy was considered the most popular by a long shot. Mama’s Boy pulled in 70 percent of the votes for “the best breakfast in Athens,” followed by Athens Bagel Co. with 12 percent and both Big City Bread and Ike & Jane with 9 percent.Which location do you think serves the best breakfast in Athens?

Tweet us and let us know.— The Red & Black (@redandblack) January 13, 2016The Red and Black also got many responses listing other favorite breakfast places that were not included on the poll including other local places such as Heirloom Café, Ideal Bagel, The Mayflower and The Grit.@redandblack Can we write in for Waffle House?— Adam Greer (@Adam_Greer) January 13, 2016Because of Mama’s Boy’s reputation for great food, the wait times tend to be long, especially on the weekends. Asman points out that this is why Athens Bagel Co. is such a good option.“We’re a quick breakfast, so it’s not as lengthy a process as some of the other breakfast restaurants in town, particularly for a Saturday or Sunday,” Asman said. “Some of the other places are more of a time commitment.”

Asman credits his customers for any success his business gathers.“Our customers make us the best,"" he said. ""We are what we are because we have great customers and I mean that. Athens has supported Athens Bagel Co. and we’re proud to exist as a result.”Hudson had very similar things to say regarding Mama’s Boy and its loyal fan base.“What’s amazing with that restaurant is that the customers and all the people are just so great,” Hudson said. “The main thing to me is that it’s a great display of people treating each other with kindness on both sides—the staff and the customers.”",Emma Hunt @ehunt831,culture,https://www.redandblack.com/culture/restaurants-vie-for-the-title-of-best-athens-breakfast/article_0c9d4be8-be1d-11e5-b522-7720986f99fb.html
24-Jan-16,"Women's basketball notebook: Caliya Robinson's first career start, team outrebounded by LSU","Caliya Robinson makes first start of career against LSUFreshman Caliya Robinson received the first start of her career for the University of Georgia Lady Bulldogs on Sunday against LSU. She has a bright future ahead of her at Georgia, having shown flashes of brilliance periodically throughout the season, but it was a day to forget for the young forward.Robinson’s start comes on the heels of an impressive performance that was integral to Georgia’s victory over Mississippi State on Jan. 21. In that game, Robinson scored seven points in the first quarter and had two huge assists off perfectly placed long passes on in-bounds. Against LSU, things did not come as easily.


 


Robinson opened the game with two straight air balls. She would go on to commit both a turnover and a foul before returning to the bench late in the first quarter. Robinson ended up playing just 14 minutes for the game, eight fewer than teammate Pachis Roberts did coming off the bench. She finished with just one point and four rebounds. Robinson did not attempt a shot after the first quarter.Lady Bulldogs coach Joni Taylor was obviously displeased with Robinson’s performance, but she understands inconsistency is part of the deal when it comes to giving freshmen significant minutes. “I just don’t think she had any energy. She turned the ball over and let not making shots bother her,” Taylor said. “At that point we had to play with more experience.”Robinson’s performance Sunday was a continuation of the up-and-down season she’s been having so far. After going 3-5 against Florida, she was held scoreless against Alabama. She was then a difference maker against Mississippi State. If Robinson wants continue to be an important part of the Lady Bulldogs team, she is going to have to find a way to play more consistently game in and game out.   Lady Bulldogs outrebounded from start to finishThe story of Georgia's loss to the LSU can be summed up with a description of the last play of the first quarter. LSU guard Rina Hill missed a layup, and the rebound was collected by Shanice Norton, also of LSU. Norton proceeded to miss a jumper, but this time Jasmine Rhodes of LSU was there to make the rebound. Norton missed another jumper, but Anne Pedersen of LSU got the board. Pedersen missed her own jumper, but once again Georgia failed to make a defensive rebound. Eventually, Hill, the player who began the possession put in a jump shot, ending the quarter.This was the story most of the night, as Georgia repeatedly failed to make rebounds on either offense or defense. They Lady Bulldogs were outrebounded 38 to 28. The Lady Tigers doubled their offensive rebound total, finishing with 18 to Georgia’s nine. That statistic becomes more disturbing by the fact that LSU’s 18 offensive rebounds was only one less than Georgia’s 19 defensive rebounds.


 


The reason for Georgia’s deficiency in collecting rebounds on both sides of the ball is particularly confusing coming after equaling Mississippi State’s rebound total last Thursday, despite having a major height disadvantage in that game. The Lady Bulldogs themselves were equally puzzled with how things went down on Sunday.“I don’t know we really just struggled going to the boards,” senior forward Merritt Hempe said. “I don’t know exactly what it is. I’m sure we’ll watch film and figure out why we weren’t boxing out or what we weren’t doing.” Andy Landers and 1995-1996 NCAA runner-up team honored at halftime in StegemanThe Lady Bulldogs held a blackout in honor of alumni day in Stegeman Coliseum on Sunday. Both former Lady Bulldog coach Andy Landers and members of the 1995-1996 runner-up women’s basketball team returned to Athens for Georgia’s tilt against the LSU Lady Tigers.Landers, the only full-time coach the Lady Bulldogs have had outside of current coach Joni Taylor, was given specific recognition in the break between the first and the second quarters. At halftime, the rest of the 1995-1996 team was recognized, and Landers signed the Bulldog inside the stadium.Senior Merritt Hempe, who witnessed the passing of the torch from Landers to Taylor this past offseason was glad to see the backing from team that remains forever faithful to the Lady Bulldogs despite the change in coaching.

“It’s really great having everyone come back, especially since it’s Joni’s first year and they didn’t play for her,” Hempe said. “The support that we have, it’s definitely a family, and it’s frustrating that we couldn’t win for them today.”Taylor saw the participation being put forward by such a large amount of members from the past team as an indicator of what Landers built in his time at Georgia. She also understands how important it is that she continue to build on what he started. “It just speaks to the foundation that he set, and the program that he built,” Taylor said. “It also reminds you that we have a responsibility to uphold and enhance the legacy of Georgia women’s basketball.”","Nathan Berg

24-Jan-16,Offense lacked the drive it needed in Lady Bulldogs loss to LSU,"After upsetting the No. 10 team in the nation in Mississippi State on Thursday, Georgia women’s basketball experienced a tough loss against LSU (8-12, 2-5) as it was defeated 53-46.The game began with three straight air balls by the Lady Bulldogs (14-6, 2-5) and four straight offensive rebounds by four different LSU players, which foreshadowed the premise of what was to occur for Georgia.When asked if there was any hangover from the previous victory, senior Merritt Hempe was almost at a loss for words.


 


“That’s a great question,” Hempe said. “I don’t know how we go from as good as we played on Thursday night to playing like this tonight. It’s really frustrating."" A total of seven LSU players saw time on the court, one of whom only recorded five minutes. And the Tigers were still able to outrebound Georgia 38 to 28. There was even a moment in the game where LSU’s 20 defensive rebounds equaled Georgia’s amount of effort in the paint in its 28 total rebounds.“I just think it’s the will and the want to rebound, myself included,” Hempe said. “We just need to box out better.” On the other side of the ball, Georgia struggled early in the first half shooting just 29 percent (5-17) from the field.Senior Shacobia Barbee was the only Georgia player to play all 40 minutes of the game and notched a meager 12 points and 7 rebounds. In addition, senior Tiaria Griffin led all Georgia scorers with just one more point than Barbee with her 13. Freshman Caliya Robinson, who came off a rather ecstatic performance on Thursday in 9 points and two key assists to Barbee for two 3-point plays, collected her first career start. But her desired performance fell short as she played 14 minutes with one point and three turnovers.  “We didn’t come out with any energy, we didn’t do anything defensively and we didn’t get enough offensive rebounds,” Georgia head coach Joni Taylor said. “When you are shooting the ball poorly, like we have the tendency of doing especially against zone, you have to create your own momentum, grab the offensive rebounds and use the defense to force turnovers. We didn’t do that today.”Adjustments were made in the second half as Georgia shot 43 percent from the field (12-28). However, it wasn’t enough to overcome LSU’s leading scorer junior Rina Hill (14 points) and company.


 


“We just need to learn how to put the ball in the basket,” Barbee said.Taylor expected the score to be low. She also anticipated there to be limitations on offense. It’s the Southeastern Conference, and according to Taylor, no team is putting up numbers like they did against non-conference opponents.And it references back to Georgia’s overall struggles in the SEC and the type of rollercoaster implementations that stem from it.“In terms of the scoring, I said this game would be in the 30s,” Taylor said. “And I looked up in the fourth quarter and they had 39 and we had 29. It’s this league. I think if you look around the league, nobody is averaging what they did in the non-conference.” Georgia looks to bounce back against Auburn on Tuesday at Stegeman Collesium with tipoff scheduled for 7 p.m.","Jacob Stansell

24-Jan-16,Georgia track and field posts strong showing on second day of McCravy Memorial,"Georgia finished up its second day of the McCravy Memorial on Saturday and showed why they are considered one of the top teams in the nation.“We showed bright spots in every event area this weekend,” Georgia head coach Petros Kyprianou said.  “I am really proud of everyone’s effort after we have trained in the cold and then showed up and competed like we have.”These bright spots were sparked by some impressive performances in the triple jump by sophomores Keturah Orji and Aliyah Johnson. Orji’s first jump of 44 feet, 4 and one-fourth inches already launched her into first place before traveling 44-5.50, placing at the top of the national ranks. 


 


“This was Keturah’s first time from a full run and I was pleased with her consistency,” said Kyprianou. Along with Orji, Johnson, who competed in the combined events as a freshman in 2015, returned to one of her high school events and finished fourth with a mark of 41-3 in the triple jump.The 800 Saturday has become one for the books as many athletes took home honors. Senior Kisean Smith completed his laps in the 800 with the third-fastest time in school history and fastest since the school record was set in 2012.  Smith registered the No. 4 time in the NCAA this year (1:48.35) to take third place.Senior Christian Harrison also had a good day on the 800 as his time of (1:49.80) would become the seventh-best time in UGA history and the 11th-best time in the country this season. Making his debut in the 800, freshman Jeramey Hampton finished 11th with a time of 1:51.85.More from field, senior Ashinia who Miller put up a new No. 1 mark in the men’s shot put at the 2015 McCravy meet Miller shined on Saturday.  Miller launched the nation’s eighth-longest throw this year (63-2.25).Newcomer Freshman Denzel Comenentia had just arrived from in Athens from the Netherlands in early January, finished third in the shot with the nation’s ninth-longest toss (63-0), which is also the sixth-best throw in school history.“Both guys in the shot put did great, pushed each other and I am very excited about what Ashinia and Denzel have to offer,” Kyprianou said.Senior Garrett Scantling continued his training with a host of other Georgia multi-event competitors and posted a personal best in the open shot put.  Scantling reached 48-1.25 while junior Devon Williams had a season-best effort of 42-3.50.


 


In the prelims of the 60 meter hurdles, Williams was times at 7.93 but finished the finals with a time of 7.87 giving him second. He was only .01 seconds off his personal best which currently holds second place in the school’s records.Scantling also competing in the pole vault placed second with a vault of 16-4.75. Joining him was senior Maicel Uibo who cleared 15-11.The records for UGA’S 3000 race were also changed Saturday thanks to Senior Steven Spevacek. Spevacek ran an 8:17.00 to take over the No. 10 spot in the record books and take 12th in the race. Also in the race, sophomore Bryan Kamau left with an impressive career best of 8:26.14.Also continuing to train for the combined events was graduate student Xenia Rahn. Rahn tossed her third attempt in the shot put a personal-best distance of 43-2.50 for 11th place.The Bulldogs ended the meet by recording the nation’s sixth-best time this year in the 4x400 relay.  Ayrian Evans, Raytez Jenkins, Maurice Freeman and Reggie Glover tied the No. 10 time in school history, which was set at the 2011 Southeastern Conference Championships, with a 3:08.90.“I think our 4x4 team has a shot at Nationals, they need to just keep developing as this season goes,” said Kyprianou.The Bulldogs' next meet is the Razorback invitational on January 29-30.","Tyree Brown

26-Jan-16,Georgia's unsettled frontcourt continues to pose problems,"Georgia’s frontcourt lacks stability and head coach Mark Fox can’t seem to fix it. Fox has shuffled his starting lineup numerous times.  He has cycled three different players in the center position alongside sophomore forward Yante Maten. Junior forward Houston Kessler has made the majority of the starts and hasn’t been overly successful. He is averaging 2.3 points per game and only three rebounds. As a result, he has ceded playing time to freshmen Derek Ogbeide and Mike Edwards. 


 


On January 16th, Ogbeide started and played 21 minutes against Texas A&M. He scored four points and collected six rebounds. Edwards started four days later against the Missouri Tigers. He only played 12 minutes and was largely inefficient.The production of all three players together isn’t meeting Fox’s expectations. Kessler, Ogbeide and Edwards have a combined average of eight points per game. Last season, seniors Marcus Thornton and Nemanja Djurisic averaged 22.5 points together. Fox isn’t used to the lack of production, but he understands the process. He said he believes the problem is finding a consistent comfort level.  “Yante is just a sophomore and it's his first time in a big role,” Fox said. “He is probably not nearly as comfortable as Marcus and Nemi were last year upfront. Some of those other guys are feeling their way and it’s important to get them all comfortable certainly.”Kessler is one player who has improved his game. He received a demotion to the bench, and it motivated him to succeed. He spent time in the gym working on his post moves and interior rebounding. It paid off against Missouri, as he collected 10 rebounds. “It definitely motivates you when you get pulled,” Kessler said. “You got to look at yourself in the mirror and realize why that happened. I wasn’t producing and coach is going to put five guys in there who he thinks is going to help win.” Fox needs all three to get Georgia to its highest potential. He said he thinks the Bulldogs are a better team with an interior presence in the paint. “We will be at our best when we get two or three of those guys playing well at the same time,” Fox said.


 


It remains to be seen who starts against LSU on Tuesday night.  Fox could go in many directions based on the matchup against freshman sensation Ben Simmons. He could opt to slot with the freshman Ogbeide in the low post or Edwards to defend the perimeter. Either way, both freshmen know they have to step up when their number is called. “I got to stay focused and stay in the right winning mindset,” Edwards said.Ogbeide agrees and said he plans to pull down more rebounds when he gets his opportunity. “I’ve always tried my best to be a high-rebounding guy,” Ogbeide said. “I’m still trying to find that gradual pace to go at. It’s a progressing-type thing and I feel like I’m starting to get back in rhythm.”","Jaylon Thompson

27-Jan-16,SGA partners with the Office for the Vice President for Instruction to host 2016 Majors Fair,"Each year the University of Georgia holds a Majors Fair,  hosted by the Student Government Association,  to provide information on majors and career opportunities.However, this year marked the first year the Office of the Vice President of Instruction reached out to SGA to assist with the program.The two groups worked together to create a larger, revamped version of the annual event.


 


Over the course of a few months of detailed planning, the 2016 Majors Fair evolved into an event that flooded the mural hallway of the Tate Student Center with students seeking advice and advisers more than willing to give it. In addition, the Career Center and University Housing were present.Each major present had a table complete with items like contact cards, informational packets, colorful presentations and treats for interested students.University Housing also provided a raffle for prizes and free Chick-fil-A.SGA Treasurer Darby Miller said the fair “‘stops students walking through Tate and makes them say ‘maybe I need to look at that more’.”The tables were arranged so each major had something in common with the table beside it. For instance, the applied sciences section was stationed next to the general sciences section and the linguistics table was next to the comparative literature table.Dylan Jolley, director of communications for SGA, described the layout of the fair as a spectrum. This allowed for students to easily navigate majors potentially close to their interests.A goal of the Majors Fair was to help freshmen and undecided majors ""figure out what they want to do with their lives,"" Jolley said.This goes beyond just choosing a major, he said.


 


“It’s not just what you do, but what you do with it,"" Jolley said.To help students get plugged in with a major, many upperclassmen were present to offer advice, and most of the major tables provided information on internships and other ways t get involved. The Henry W. Grady College of Journalism and Mass Communications table had information promoting the Cannes Lions study abroad trip for Grady students already enrolled in their major.To Anusha Gopali, SGA senator for the Franklin College of Arts and Science, the fair was helpful both this year and last year.“I went to the fair last year and had a completely different set of questions than I do this year,” she said. Advisers for certain majors had expectations for the fair.The linguistics table described themselves as a smaller major and hoped to gain publicity from the fair and encourage students to take a minor or second major as linguistics does not pose many conflicts.  According to the linguistics department, adding a second major or a minor can give a student’s resume a competitive edge, and certain major classes spill over into other major classes, making obtaining extra degrees easier.

On the other hand, biology is one of the top most popular majors at UGA.Freshmen who struggle with choosing what to do with a biology major were able talk with advisor Elizabeth Fuller. “With biology there is a breadth of knowledge across a lot of disciplines so they can make their major their own,” Fuller said.At the fair, Fuller said she hoped to, “make students aware of the opportunities available to them.”Students who were unable to attend the career fair can still discover these opportunities by contacting their advisers, department heads or the Career Center.",Hannah Echols @echols_hannah,uganews,https://www.redandblack.com/uganews/sga-partners-with-the-office-for-the-vice-president-for/article_601a7ee8-c4a4-11e5-9d61-0fa804dfe3ac.html
27-Jan-16,"SGA passes 'graffiti resolution,' current budget at first meeting of the semester","In a short and sweet 15 minutes, the University of Georgia Student Government Association conducted its first senate meeting of the semester on Jan. 26.Important points of the meeting included the passing of Resolution 28-14, the establishment of the current SGA budget and the proposal of a new SGA GOTCHA initiative.Several application deadlines were also mentioned, in addition to an announcement about the upcoming 'End It Day' that SGA will support on Feb. 25.


 


Maggie Little, senator for the Lamar Dodd School of Art, introduced Resolution 28-14, which will turn graffiti located outside of Creswell Hall into a public art project. Currently, the graffiti spells out ‘DOPE’ on the concrete wall and bus stop next to the dorm.The senate unanimously voted to pass Little’s resolution. SGA's next steps for the resolution are to meet with the Residence Hall Association and the Visual Art Department to develop this project and put the mural together.SGA hopes to create a committee to search for a student artist to design and paint the mural in order to represent art majors.“Art students have felt underrepresented in SGA, and this would be an excellent opportunity to include them,” Little said.Photo by Casey Sykes


 


SGA’s current budget, $34,121.85, was also announced by Treasurer Darby Miller.That number will be adjusted throughout the semester according to the organization's needs, Miller said.Current plans for the funds include appropriations for Mayor Commission Day, SEC Excursion, Better Relations Day, Dawgs at the Dome and several other smaller expenses like room reservations and flyer distribution for upcoming events.“Right now we have a pretty large budget, but we could see that increasing or decreasing,” Miller said.Johnelle Simpson, current president of SGA, also announced a new GOTCHA initiative students can look forward to.SGA hopes to expand GOTCHA, a free campus transportation service, to cater to sorority and fraternity houses in order to provide safe and judgement-free rides for as many students as possible.

Johnelle said he will apply to be a GOTCHA driver in order to spread the word about GOTCHA and make sure that students are aware of its presence and usefulness on campus.Two application deadlines were also mentioned at the meeting. For those wanting to run in the Student Body Elections, applications are due Feb. 17. In addition, the Student Alumni Council applications will close on Feb. 1. Jordan Arnold, a student involved with the ‘End It Movement,' also came to promote this organization, whose mission is to fight human trafficking globally.Arnold announced the organization’s big ‘End It Day’ event on Feb. 25.In addition, Arnold also said the 'End Movement It' at UGA is currently accepting applications for joint-committee members.","Hannah Echols and Kate Huller

27-Jan-16,Georgia preps for tangle with Auburn Tigers,"The Georgia Lady Bulldogs will play their third consecutive home game on Thursday when they take on the Auburn Tigers at home. It will be the second group of Tigers that Georgia has faced in as many games, having played LSU on Jan. 24.Auburn (13-7, 3-4) comes into the game in nearly the same position as Georgia (14-6, 2-5). While the Tigers enjoyed a successful run out of conference schedule, the scene has gotten toug. Like Georgia, Auburn has fallen to a myriad of highly-ranked Southeastern Conference opponents.The most dangerous players offensively for Auburn are its big three. Its trio of guard in Brandy Montgomery, forward Tra’cee Tanner, and forward Katie Frerking has been causing nightmares for its opponents all season and have been responsible for 64 percent of the Tigers' points this season.


 


While the Tigers star players will inevitably cause some damage on Thursday, Georgia coach Joni Taylor believes the key to a Lady Bulldogs victory is preventing the Tigers from settling in offensively.“We’ve got to make sure we contain those three for sure and not let anyone else have high scoring nights,” Taylor said.Georgia will look to improve offensively upon its last outing, in which it scored only 46 points against a struggling LSU squad. While defense hasn’t been a huge problem recently for the Lady Bulldogs, offensive production has taken a significant dip since the start of conference play. The team has not had trouble stopping opposing teams on defense at all of late. If Georgia can create some sort of offensive rhythm, it looks to be in good shape to start winning conference games more consistently.“We’ve got to focus on making shots, not just taking shots,” senior guard Marjorie Butler said. “Taking smart shots. There’s shots out there that we know we can make. It’s a matter of repetition.""Georgia has started off SEC play in a 2-5 hole, which leaves it tied for last in the SEC. If the Lady Bulldogs want to compete for the SEC title this year, they’re going to have to start turning things around soon, and Thursday’s game is essentially a must win.The game tips off on Jan. 28 at 7:00 p.m. in Stegeman Coliseum.

29-Jan-16,Take the Dare: UGA Miracle hosts Doughnut Dare 5K,"Making the unlikely combination of doughnuts and long-distance running, UGA Miracle will host its fifth annual Doughnut Dare 5k Road Race on Jan. 31. Participants will race through the University of Georgia campus, but for those who choose to take the dare, there is an extra twist.A group of brave runners will run half the race, stop to eat 10 Krispy Kreme doughnuts, continue the 5k and attempt to keep their doughnuts down.“It’s a crazy fun atmosphere,” said Alexa Crow, the marketing director of UGA Miracle. “People come in costumes, it’s all about fun.”


 


UGA’s race will start and end near Stegeman Coliseum, and the runner who completes the race and keeps all ten doughnuts down will be crowned the champion.The race will have runners who “Take the Dare” and others who just want to race. There will also be those whom UGA Miracle calls “Moralers” to pump up the runners by holding signs, cheering and encouraging them.""Because we have so many members involved, they’re able to pull from all of their different facets of life and invest in people to get them to come,” Crow said.The Doughnut Dare is one of UGA Miracle’s many events to raise money for Children’s Healthcare of Atlanta (CHOA). Last year, the event raised around $17,000, and this year Miracle is hoping for $20,000.“Anyone who wants to help raise money for CHOA can be involved in this whether they’re a runner or not,” said Hannah Allison, a part of UGA Miracle’s member development committee.UGA Miracle expects to have about 800 runners at this year’s event, and there will be many exciting attractions for racers beyond the 5k. A post-race concert by Athens band The Masonics will be held, and Smoothie King will be at the event as well.The Doughnut Dare is modeled after a race at North Carolina State University benefitting the North Carolina Children’s Hospital called the Krispy Kreme Challenge.All of the doughnuts for the race have been donated, so all proceeds from the race will go directly to CHOA.


 


“Whether you are a runner and want to get some practice with a real race or just want to walk and take home a box of doughnuts, this is a great race for both!” said Allison.",Kalli Drake @kalliausten,culture,https://www.redandblack.com/culture/take-the-dare-uga-miracle-hosts-doughnut-dare-k/article_d1d3a654-c6c0-11e5-899f-13ce48ddc4c3.html
29-Jan-16,FourAthens connects local startups,"FourAthens held its annual open house Monday, Jan. 25, where it showcased local startup culture. The all-day event presented an opportunity for startup founders in the Athens area to pitch ideas to investors, connect with mentors and learn from one another.Project director Jim Flannery said FourAthens connects startups with mentors and exposes entrepreneurs to potential investors.“The size of your network, the people that you connect with, will help you grow,” Flannery said. 


 


Throughout the day,  local startup teams practiced pitching their ideas to potential investors and mentors. Older members with more experience offered critiques and encouragement, at times drilling presenters with questions about sustainability and whether a market for their product even existed.Many attendees had connections to the University of Georgia. According to Flannery’s 2016 State of Startup Address, UGA alumni, students and faculty make up 64 percent of the startup founders in FourAthens. A number of current students and alumni showed up during the event to learn, network and present their ideas. Bryan Wish, founder of The Wish Dish, is one of the UGA alumni who received help with his presentation and exposure to the community. Wish, who graduated last May, created his company as a platform for people to share their thoughts and ideas.Younger founders, many of them university undergraduates, lined up to deliver their one-minute pitches on ideas in a wide range of markets including the health sector, retail and apps.Through FourAthens, 134 new jobs were created by fewer than 25 member companies in 2015, Flannery said in his address. In 2016, Flannery expects these numbers to grow even more, as 19 members plan to add another 43 jobs in the first half of the year. Looking at the future, Flannery said FourAthens intends to have 10 percent of the Athens population employed by high growth tech startups.“They are the people who are going to change Athens,” he said.","Lisa Fu

30-Jan-16,"Q&A;: Aaron Carter still making music, doesn't care what you think about it","Aaron Carter, at 28-years-old, has overcome the stigma of his child-fame and looks to the future of his music career with pride and confidence. Carter spoke with The Red & Black about his upcoming career, his support and the adversity he faces in his daily life. Carter will perform at The Foundry on Wednesday, Feb. 3.Red & Black: Can I call you Aaron?Aaron Carter: I don't know, should I call you Ms. Andrews? 


 


R&B: No, not at all. Call me Adrienne. AC: I think I like Ms. Andrews better.R&B: If you want to call me that, that's fine too. How have you been? What have you been up to today?AC: Not much. Just hanging out in my living room doing nothing with my life. But not really, I've been on tour, I've been working, I've been doing TV shows, I'm producing music, I'm rebuilding and rebranding my company and myself. Just working really hard and staying focused and doing creative projects that I believe in and really just putting out what I feel is right for myself and not really caring about what everybody wants anymore. Just doing what I want to do.R&B: Are you working on any new material lately for an album?AC: Yeah, if you go check out my Twitter, you'll see all the posts for everything that's happening for the year to come. So, it's going to be an intense year. Like I said, I'm record producer, I'm my music producer, I'm my writer. I'm out here doing shows with my new music and my fans are loving it and responding so well. It's pretty amazing. ""Maybe this time around someone will give me something memorable to have like, 'Oh! There was that one girl who came up on stage and puked on my DJ.' He's sitting right here, looking at me like, 'Really, dude?'""


 


R&B: Who would you say inspires you, if you could only name just one?AC: As an inspiration? Well, right now, I'd say Deadmau5.R&B: Do you work with Deadmau5?AC: Yeah, I've worked with Deadmau5 and he's a good friend of the family. Deadmau5 is a very big DJ. He's the guy that wears the big mouse head when he's on stage.R&B: What's your favorite thing to do when you're not performing?AC: I like to produce and make beats. R&B: About how much of your time is spent doing that?


TNCMS.AdManager.render({region: 'fixed-big-ad-bottom-asset', slot: 1, fold: ""below""});


AC: Oh, I mean, the majority of it. When I'm not making beats, I'm working on my branding, my career. I'm always talking about all the shows that I have. I got about 150 shows coming up for the rest of the year. Just all kinds of cool stuff going on. ALOT of things have influenced me over the years it's time to put it all together.— Aaron Carter (@aaroncarter) January 30, 2016R&B: Is there a certain reason that you're returning to Athens? I know you did a show here a couple years ago. AC: No, I don't have anything memorable. So, maybe this time around someone will give me something memorable to have like, 'Oh! There was that one girl who came up on stage and puked on my DJ.' He's sitting right here, looking at me like, 'Really, dude?'R&B: I noticed that there was some drama on Twitter the other day with Justin Bieber saying some things.AC: I have nothing to tell you about that. R&B: OK, it's alright. I just wanted to know if you wanted to talk about it a little.

AC: Nah, but you can quote me that I don't. You can say everything verbatim. I don't care. Yeah, it is what it is. I'm not going to keep harping on it. You know? They're the ones mentioning me in their interviews after 10 years when I haven't released any music, so, maybe that says something. I don't know.""I'm never going to give up on music. Ever. Until the day I die. No matter how successful I am or how unsuccessful I am. If there's one person out there for me to sing to, I'll always do it.""R&B: If you were someone else looking in on your life, how you would you describe Aaron Carter?AC: I would describe myself as perseverant.R&B: Why do you say that? AC: Because I never give up on what I believe in. I'm never going to give up on music. Ever. Until the day I die. No matter how successful I am or how unsuccessful I am. If there's one person out there for me to sing to, I'll always do it. If that's gotta be my girlfriend, then I'll do it. I'll make music for her.

R&B: What about music makes you feel that way?AC: When I perform my new music, and even the old stuff too, I love it. I absolutely eat it up. I get pissed off when I have drunk fans in my audience when I'm trying to talk about my new music and they're screaming at me, 'You motherf---ing piece of s--t, you better play that song, you a--hole!' That's not OK. Do you think that's OK to do to somebody when they're on stage? R&B: No.AC: Am I supposed to just be like, 'Yeah, OK, let me just give you what you want. Here you go.' No. That's not who I am. That's what people are screaming and shouting out at me, being f---ing disrespectful. Excuse my language. But, you know? People want to be like, 'Why you so angry? Why you mad?' and I'm like, 'Yo, take a walk in my shoes.' Take a walk in my shoes and maybe you'll see that I'm actually not angry. I'm actually very literate, I'm educated and very well-spoken. And I'm very successful and I make a lot of money. That's got to say something. You know?I'm focused on what I believe in, determination is an understatement. This WILL be difficult. uphill battles only make you stronger.— Aaron Carter (@aaroncarter) January 30, 2016R&B: Is there anything that you'd like to say to your fans in Athens?

AC: Yeah, I f---ing love you guys. And thanks for sticking with me. Have some respect and come to my shows and realize that you're going to see a 28-year-old man, who you have probably no idea who I am and what I'm doing with my life. So, let that happen.And don't come and be a fake fan. If you're going to come and be a fake fan, then I'm gonna call you out on it. People come to my shows to make fun of me sometimes, and then they see what I'm doing, that I'm singing a four-octave range, and I can sing just as good as anybody out there, if not better. I practice my craft every single day. I went and did off-Broadway for two years, eight shows a week, like 550 shows in a row without stopping. That's the second time I've done Broadway in my career. I'm 28-years-old, like, I'm a baby still. It's a new era, it's a new time.R&B: What can we expect from a live show?AC: I don't care about what they expect. That doesn't matter to me. It's not about what you guys expect anymore. It's my life, my career, and what I'm doing, if you guys don't like it, then don't buy my records, don't watch my videos, don't come to my concerts. I'd rather you not do that. I'd rather do what I feel is right for myself and fail, versus do what everyone else thinks is right and succeed. Feel me? Why? So at the end of the day, like, they all get what they want but you don't get what you want? No. People being like, 'Oh my God, you should be singing all only songs from when you were 12!' No, dude, I'm going to be reinventing myself and making a statement as a man. And, yeah, I might be a little egotistical about it. But you know what? Whatever. I work really hard. I just deal with a lot of adversity, but I've got a really great team around me and a really great support system when it comes to everyone who works for me now. I love my team and it's going to stay that way. Until somebody does something stupid and then they can be expendable. It's about 2016. I look forward to it.",Adrienne Andrews @a_l_andrews,culture,https://www.redandblack.com/culture/q-a-aaron-carter-still-making-music-doesn-t-care/article_04daed26-c76d-11e5-91ab-b70b116d20a8.html
6-Feb-16,Project Safe holds 17th annual showing of 'The Vagina Monologues' to raise money for survivors of domestic violence,"Beginning Feb. 4, local nonprofit, Project Safe, is showing the award-winning play “The Vagina Monologues” in the university chapel. The play will run for four consecutive days, including showings at 8 p.m. on Feb. 5 and 6 and a showing at 3 p.m. on Feb. 7. This is Project Safe’s 17th annual presentation of “The Vagina Monologues.” Just as its title suggests, “The Vagina Monologues” is a collection of monologues presented by women of all ages and backgrounds about their various feminine body experiences, including sex, rape, harassment, masturbation and genital mutilation.


 


 The play’s unconventional setting has women sitting in a row of chairs taking turns to talk about provocative topics with titles from “The Flood” and “Vagina Happy Fact” to “Because He Liked to Look at It” and “Hair.” “Don’t believe them when he tells you it smells like rose petals when it’s supposed to smell like pussy. That’s what they’re doing, trying to clean it up, make it smell like bathroom spray or a garden. All those douche sprays, floral, berry, rain. I don’t want my pussy to smell like rain. All cleaned up like washing a fish after you cooked it. I want to taste the fish. That’s why I ordered it.” Waves of laughter erupted among the audience when the performers demonstrated different moaning sounds, ranging from the “elegant moan”, the “uninhibited militant bisexual moan”, the “machine-gun moan” and the “college moan,” which went something like “I should be studying.” The audience burst into laughter again when an actress performing the “Reclaiming Cunt” monologue yelled fiercely at those under the stage and demanded them to chant “cunt” at her.


 


 The play is performed by UGA students, staff and other “vagina enthusiasts.”Tickets cost $15 and all proceeds from the play will go toward supporting Project Safe’s effort to end domestic violence through education and to services for survivors of domestic violence in the community. Shilpa Jais, sophomore biological engineering major, said it was the second time she watched the play, and she really enjoyed it. “My favorite story was “My Angry Vagina” because I agreed with all three of the stances. Usually people don’t talk about women having pleasure, because they think it’s such a bad thing to do or to have,” Jais said.

Alyssa Vinson, junior sport management major, said she liked all the monologues because of their honesty. “Usually people don’t talk about these things,” Vinson. “There were times when I was a little bit uncomfortable, but it was also a little bit empowering. It was good, I enjoyed it.”",Pui Wong @puiwong8,uganews,https://www.redandblack.com/uganews/project-safe-holds-th-annual-showing-of-the-vagina-monologues/article_b0099964-cd1b-11e5-b6d3-4fe8a7b582b0.html
7-Feb-16,Guest speaker comments on virtual stereotypes and gamer culture,"Nick Yee, the co-founder and analytics lead at Quantic Foundry, said there tends to be a stereotype of virtual worlds and the people who play in them.As a part of the Jim Kennedy Lecture series on Jan. 28, presented by the Department of Advertising and Public Relations at the Grady College of Journalism and Mass Communications, Yee spoke on this stereotype.“When people think of games and virtual worlds, we typically stereotype them as being escapist fantasies,” Yee said. “They are places where we are able to create new identities and free to reinvent ourselves. But over the course of my research career, I’ve tended to find the opposite.”


 


This freedom people believe to exist in virtual worlds, Yee said, is actually an illusion. He said his data has shown people’s real life characteristics tend to be the same in their virtual world avatar.“We often think of games where we can pretend to be someone we’re not, but over and over again, a lot of the data I’ve seen shows the opposite is actually true,” Yee said. “Games are more of an identity management tool. You play as who you are.”For example, Yee said, extroverts in real life tend to enjoy group activities in the virtual world, and introverts kept to themselves in games just as they would in real life.There is one thing, however, Yee said people strived for in their virtual world no matter what their real lives were like.“Whenever you give people virtual bodies, they have this instinctive need to make those bodies look pretty,” Yee said.Just as researchers have proven people associate attractiveness with other good qualities, Yee said the same is accurate in the virtual world.He said the more attractive avatars are more confident, and other avatars are more likely to walk up to the attractive avatars.This is among many status symbols that gamers try to obtain in the virtual world, just as they might in the real world, Yee said.


 


“The status symbols that we have become familiar with, such as big house, style and nice things are all interconnected,” Yee said. “It’s really hard for people to invent new status symbols in the virtual world, so they fall back on symbols that they are most familiar with.”Especially in games like ""Second Life"" — a 3D virtual world where users can customize their own avatar, socialize with other avatars and create their own imaginary life — Yee said what the gamer views as perfection is more obtainable because houses and clothes cost next to nothing in the virtual world.Seeking perfection in a virtual world may not be a surprise, but Yee said what non-gamers may not suspect is that gaming is a social act, and people are playing with other people they know in real life.“Most video game play is actually incredibly social,” Yee said. “When you’re playing a game, your kid, sibling or someone else might comment on that activity. That’s a huge part of gaming, whether it’s in your home or online. It’s an unexpected use of VR in that it’s social.”",Katelyn Umholtz @Kumh0ltz,uganews,https://www.redandblack.com/uganews/guest-speaker-comments-on-virtual-stereotypes-and-gamer-culture/article_37370e72-cdb6-11e5-8adf-6f05f67d3b60.html
7-Feb-16,Top 5 fitness trends to get you spring break ready,"It’s that time of year again; time to lose those extra pounds gained during Christmas break.

The variety of options offers a way to get in shape that will definitely appeal to all the different preferences of college students. Here is a list of the top five fitness trends in Athens that will be sure to keep you motivated and keep you coming back.


 


1. Orange TheoryOrange Theory fitness is the new fitness craze on the market. This group workout is all based on the heart rate. This heart-pumping 60-minute workout gives you more energy, tones your body and burns extra calories – even after the workout is over. The class consists of three different components: indoor rowing, treadmill training and weight training blocks. Orange Theory’s claim to fame is that calories will still be burning 36 hours after the class is over due to the high-intensity interval workout that targets your metabolism. This is also the perfect class for those who love competition. The entire classes heart rate is displayed on a screen throughout the class to motivate every one in there.2. Pure BarrePure Barre is all about the tucking and the toning. Pure Barre uses a low-impact technique that focuses on all the areas that women want to tone most. The use of the ballet bar in the 55-minute class allows for tiny isometric movements tones your body and builds lean muscle. After each toning exercise, there is a stretch section so that all the tension is released and you can comfortably move on to the next exercise. There is also a Pure Barre platform class that is more upbeat and is more focused on cardio and getting your heart rate going. It is guaranteed that you will see results after just 10 classes.3. BlastBlast combines cardio interval training and strength conditioning that burns up to 900 calories an hour. Throughout the workout, the 16-person class splits in half and alternates between the floor and the treadmill ever five minutes.

7-Feb-16,Georgia shows strengths at Virginia Tech Doc Hale Elite Meet,"Georgia completed day three of the Virginia Tech Doc Hale Elite Meet in Blacksburg, Virginia on Saturday. The Virginia Tech Doc Hale Elite Meet was highlighted by some record jumps by Senior Chanice Porter and sophomore Keturah Orji.Porter, who is competing in the long jump for the second year at Georgia, tied Georgia’s fifth-best mark of all-time with a 6 foot, 1 ½ inch clearance to win. Porter not only heaved herself into first place, but the four time All-American beat her personal record and tied for second on the NCAA list. 


 


Leading the NCAA in the triple jump, Orji flew for two marks above 44’ as she ended with a top effort of 44-2.50 earning first place.“I thought we got some good training out of this meet and to have the performance from Chanice [Porter] was a big bonus,” said Bulldog head coach Petros Kyprianou, adding that Porter’s performance was the “highlight” for the Bulldogs.Orji, who was the indoor runner-up at Nationals last year and won the 2015 NCAA outdoor title, is the only competitor in the NCAA this year to reach 44 feet.Fellow sophomore Aliyah Johnson followed with a jump of 40-10.25 for a third-place finish in the triple jump as well.In the pole vault, Junior Georgia Stefanidi continued her development and posted a season-best mark of 13-5.25 to finish third.“A lot of the highly-ranked teams decided to rest this weekend,"" Kyprianou said. ""We decided to compete some people and it worked out well for us. I am looking forward to see where these teams can go.  I think we will be shooting to give the best we can give when Nationals arrive.”Coming into Thursday, the Lady Bulldogs ranked No.2 in the nation by the in the latest U.S. Track & Field and Cross Country Coaches Association (USTFCCCA) poll while the Bulldog men were 10th.The Bulldogs split up and go three different directions next weekend.  Georgia makes the trip to the Husky Classic (Seattle, Wash.), Samford Open/Invitational (Birmingham, Ala.) and Music City Challenge (Nashville, Tenn.) for their next set of meets.

8-Feb-16,UGA student opens make-your-own donut shop in Athens,"After opening a location in Washington, D.C., last year, owner Tony Raffa is happy to be opening Zombie Coffee and Donuts in Athens.Raffa, a 22-year-old business major at the University of Georgia, said the shop will have coffee and donuts made fresh-to-order but it will be set up more like a frozen yogurt shop than like a donut shop, with customers getting to choose their own toppings.Raffa said he had the idea for the business while he was still running a software business with his friends as a college freshman. While working on an app for restaurants, he met Chuck Rendelman, the president of a yogurt franchise called FroZenYo.


 


From talking to Rendelman about the frozen yogurt business, he came up with the idea of applying the same have-it-your-way setup to donuts. Raffa then teamed up with Rendelman to create Zombie Coffee and Donuts.The logo is a red eye representing the zombie motif and the state of the customers before they drink coffee, according to Raffa.“You’re a zombie before you have your coffee,” Raffa said.Raffa described how the business works, saying donuts run on a conveyor belt all day, and when a worker takes a donut off the belt for a customer, the customer can then ask for toppings ranging from the usual glazes and powder to the unusual cookies and other foods, including the most popular, maple glaze with bacon.Customers can ask for as many toppings at they want, the price per donut remains constant. Raffa said he does not want any customer to be discouraged from having it their way because of the price.“I don’t like it when people don’t know what price they’re going into,” he said. “If you’re going to have it your way, I want you to know what price you’re looking at first.”The same policy goes for the coffee. Raffa said customers will be able to top the coffee any way they want to with self-serve machines, or they can ask the barista to make them specialty drinks.Raffa said he plans to keep the shop operating around the schedule of many college students, from 7 a.m. to 2 a.m. The store will also deliver donuts around the Athens area, he said.


 


To show his appreciation, Raffa said he plans to give some of the shop’s proceeds to the city and school district, but is allowing his customers to vote to decide where else they want the donations to go.“There’s really no place like Athens. It's pretty unique,” Raffa said. “It has that kind of feeling that everyone has got each other’s back. It’s honestly a community that I feel like has given me a lot.”","Casey Williams

11-Feb-16,German author presents cinematic poem at UGA,"What mental images do you create to explain the reality around you? Are they of beauty or of terror? These are questions that are tackled in Werner Fritsch’s cinematic poem “Faust Song of the Sun,” which will be shown Feb. 12 at 4 p.m. in the Lamar Dodd School of Art in the S150 auditorium.Fritsch is an acclaimed author, poet and director with numerous works across all different forms. Though this will be the first film by Fritsch to be shown at the University of Georgia, the film has earned acclaim and attention in Germany.“Fritsch is one of the boldest poets in German literature, and he’s a crossover between media,” said Dr. Nobert Eke, a distinguished visiting professor who will give a lecture at UGA detailing Fritsch’s work.


 


The opportunity to have Fritsch himself come introduce himself happened almost by chance. Eke, who had previously been familiar with Fritsch’s work, spoke about showing “Faust Song of the Sun” to the public. At the same time, Fritsch was currently in America to shoot footage for his latest film. The Germanic and Slavic Department decided to invite him, and he accepted.“It’s a unique opportunity, especially for people who come to his screening, to visit with the author, to hear from him about the movie and talk with him afterwards and discuss the film,” said Dr. Martin Kagel, the department head of Germanic & Slavic Studies. Inspired by a section of the play “Faust” by Johann Wolfgang Goethe, “Faust Song of the Sun” attempts to look that moment and explore it deeper by focusing on the beautiful moments experienced in life.The format of a cinematic poem was a deliberate choice by Fritsch to allow viewers to form their own conclusions from the film. Because of the freedom of association, viewers can come away with multiple answers, rather than just one.“It’s like reading a book of poems,” Fritsch said. “You can be free to have your own imagination.”“Faust Song of the Sun” also tackles the idea of globalization and views it from a different standpoint. Instead of focusing on images of war and violence, Fritsch chooses to show the poetic moments people experience in their lives and help them be conscious of these moments.Since it focuses more on the person’s own response, viewers must be active participants. The mixed media approach was employed by Fritsch in order to foster a response from his viewers and allow them to see what inner images they carry in their daily lives.“It’s like watching a piece of nature,” Faust said.


 


The film itself is three hours and only serves as the first part of “Faust Song of the Sun,” with the second part recently completed and the third one being currently created. Before introducing the screening of his film, Fritsch will read from his play “Nico: Sphinx of Ice.”A multimedia installation by Ideas for Creative Exploration based on the work will follow it. After the “Faust Song of Sun” screening, a reception will be held to allow audience members to interact with the author.“What students would take away from it is a better understanding of a maybe shared heritage, a common culture and the significance of culture difference — not in a negative way, but in a positive way,” Kagel said.",Danny McArthur,culture,https://www.redandblack.com/culture/german-author-presents-cinematic-poem-at-uga/article_cc8ef0b6-cf91-11e5-99a1-5f396df13956.html
14-Feb-16,Georgia closes indoor regular season with success,"The Georgia Bulldogs reached the end of their indoor regular season on Saturday.The team members split up this weekend by taking their talents to the Samford Open in Birmingham, Alabama, the Husky Classic in Seattle, Washington, and the Music City Challenge in Nashville, Tennessee, on Saturday.The trip to Nashville was a lone one for Georgia’s 4x4 team but prompted commendable results. The team comprised of Ayrian Evans, Derrick White, Maurice Freeman and Raytez Jenkins combined to run a 3:08.44 to win their event and move to 13th on the national list.


 


At the Samford meet, senior Shelby Ashe bested the competition with a throw of 66 feet, 9 ¾ inches. Ashe improved her No. 21 mark on the national list and third spot on the SEC list with a win in the weight throw. She improved her No. 4 mark on Georgia’s all-time top-10 list.Also changing the record books is senior Ashley Henry, who ran the fastest time in the 400 since Shaunae Miller in 2013. Henry came in at 53.86 to finish second and move to No. 6 in the school record books.The woman’s 60 meter final proved a strong showing for Georgia, as senior Chanice Porter and sophomore Katie Stone finished second and third, respectively. Porter, who came into the weekend ranked in the top five nationally in both the long and high jumps, ran a 7.58 for runner-up honors as she continued her training. Stone matched her career best with a 7.58 to finish third.The 3000 produced a number of personal best for the Bulldogs on Saturday. Allie Castro (10:14.29), Kingsley Green (10:15.31) and Lauren Hovis (10:16.31) for fourth, fifth and seventh, while Morgan Malanoski (8:33.31)  and Michael Giuliano (8:37.86) took fourth and seventh for the men.The Husky Classic produced some strong finishes Saturday as senior Kisean Smith left with his second 1:48 of the year in the 800 after finishing second with a 1:48.94.  In the same race, senior Christian Harrison bested his No. 7 spot on the Bulldogs’ all-time top-10 list with a 1:49.35 for sixth place.Georgia returns to indoor competition for the Southeastern Conference indoor championships arrive in Fayetteville, Arkansas, on Feb. 26-27.","Tyree Brown

15-Feb-16,UGA honors three with award for applying MLK teachings to kick-off Black History Month,"February 14 is, in addition to Valentines Day, also the birthday of one of the United States’ most celebrated African-American activists — Frederick Douglass.His birthday is one of two, the other Abraham Lincoln’s, that designate February as Black History Month, a time dedicated to remembering the rich history and traditions of African-Americans in this country.In the spirit of honoring African-American history and its most influential people, the University of Georgia bestowed the “Fulfilling the Dream Award” at its 13th annual Martin Luther King Jr. Freedom Breakfast on Jan. 22.


 


The award was given to three members of the Athens community, including UGA senior Darren Anglin, William Kisaalita, a professor in the College of Engineering and Homer Wilson, the owner of Wilson’s Styling Shop.These individuals were chosen because of the way they have applied Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.’s ideology to make a significant contribution regarding race relations, justice and human rights, said Michelle Cook, associate provost and chief diversity officer for UGA.Cook said they met the four requirements for the award, which include significant contribution to the advancement of social justice, human rights and/or race relations, promotion of Dr. King’s example of volunteerism and civic engagement to address critical community issues, utilization of Dr. King’s philosophy to reduce tensions, resolve conflict and foster goodwill and demonstrated effort to use Dr. King’s teachings to build bridges of understanding and unity.The presentation of this award is one of several upcoming events that will be held by the university to honor the history of African-Americans.“This award is an opportunity for the entire UGA, Athens-Clarke County community to celebrate the bridges that connect us. It allows us to pay homage to those whose lives and work contribute to building a better community for all,” Cook said.",Kate Huller @katehuller,athensnews,https://www.redandblack.com/athensnews/uga-honors-three-with-award-for-applying-mlk-teachings-to/article_93be912c-d3f3-11e5-9de2-6f4b81b369de.html
15-Feb-16,Hansen's Hits: Feb. 15,"First things first, Beyoncé isn’t on this list. That’s not my choice; she decided not to put “Formation” on Spotify. This plus Kanye West’s escapade with “The Life of Pablo” forced me to finally crack and get the free 30-day subscription for Tidal, so I guess they win in the end. However, even though Beyoncé’s anti-police brutality – don’t skim over the last word there – isn’t on this list, there were many other quality songs released this week for Spotify fans to enjoy.“Body Talk” – FoxesLondon pop starlet Foxes mixes electronica with melodic pop sensibilities on “Body Talk” to great effect. The chorus is especially energetic with a thumping drum pattern and layered vocals.


 


“Witness” – Trixie WhitleyThis guitar-driven track definitely has a blues undercurrent to it that I just love. The intricate guitar plucking leads into a bit of a confusing, out-of-place chorus upon first listen, but it Whitley’s beautiful falsetto grew on me quickly, making it one of my favorite aspects of the track.“The Noisy Days Are Over” – Field MusicWith vocal harmonies that sound straight out of the 60s and instrumentation out of the 70s, this retro track by Field Music does everything right. For a lengthy track, the pulsating guitar never loses its flavor and neither does the poppy drumming or the multiple chorus repeats.“Headlong” – Laurence Fox“Headlong” has so much more energy than I expected it to have. Starting with a fast-paced guitar pattern and piano riff, the track quickly builds to a fantastic string-backed chorus that carries the track to fruition.“Summer” – Anchor & BrailleStephen Christian’s side project Anchor & Braille has filled a larger need in my life since Anberlin went on hiatus in 2014. While I still prefer Anberlin’s melding of energetic alternative rock with electronic elements, Anchor & Braille’s slower, more methodical brand of electronica gets the job done. And maybe it’s just Valentine’s day, but the touching lyrics of “Summer” hit me at the right time.


 


“Dark Energy” – The CultThe Cult deliver an aptly-named, energetic track with “Dark Energy.” The drum work especially stands out driving the track and becoming the focus on the chorus with multiple syncopated fills backing the vocal harmonies. “Wonderful Crazy Night” – Elton JohnThis may be Elton John’s 32nd album, and he may sound a little on autopilot at this point, the charts are solely missing a jazz-influenced swing tune like “Wonderful Crazy Night.” The piano and walking baseline are the clear standouts, and I also enjoy a good piano solo, which the track definitely delivers.“Riot” – ScooterOne of the more interesting tracks on this list, Scooter is a German dance and trance group that has been making music since the 80s. While the pre-chorus and versus are a bit cheesy, especially the elongated “Woahs,” the chorus more than makes up for it with a great guitar riff and a danceable beat.“Dopamine” – DIIVIndie group DIIV released one of the most consistent albums this week with “Is the Is Are,” and my favorite track has to be “Dopamine.” The song has a silky guitar progression with vocals that meld into the background to create a dreamy atmosphere.

“Illuminate the Trail” – TexturesFans of progressive metalcore will find plenty to enjoy in Textures’s new album “Phenotype.” However, this track strands out for its first melodic chorus surrounded by electronic elements wavering in the background before murdering the tracks time signature for the rest of the song.",Zach Hansen @zach_ehansen,culture,https://www.redandblack.com/culture/hansen-s-hits-feb/article_e6875714-d438-11e5-9af9-d74554303600.html
17-Feb-16,"Yeezus rose from the grave a zombie, not savior","Kanye West’s spectacle is beginning to lose its luster. Yeezus, for as much as he thinks he’s a musical savior, is no more than a reanimated, stylized corpse regurgitating his old ideas that are now withering away to bare bones.This led to “The Life of Pablo,” an album that thinks it’s much smarter and groundbreaking than it actually is. Having 18 tracks clock in at just under an hour, the skits and short interludes don’t provide cohesion to a singular concept; they instead clutter the track listing and lengthen what should have been just a five or six track EP. This is not album of the year. This is album of the life.— KANYE WEST (@kanyewest) January 26, 2016


 


With over 25 other guest artists appearing – topping the 22 features on his magnum opus “My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy,” West gets lost or flat-out overshadowed by a few guest stars. Chance the Rapper steals the opening track “Ultralight Beam” from West, blowing his verse out of the water; the same goes for Kendrick Lamar’s verse on the equally excellent “No More Parties In LA.” Those plus “FML” are the three highlights of the entire album – not to be confused with the mediocre banger “Highlights.”And while some of the best tracks from “MBDTF” featured up to nine guest artists, the spotlight was always on West. His presence was undeniable, and while he occasionally dropped corny lines, he would make up for it with charisma and reflexive jabs at himself.The closest West gets to likable on “TLOP” is the 44-second, joke interlude “I Love Kanye” where he pokes fun at his own musical and personal dichotomy over the years. It’s easy to think he’s in on the joke, laughing with the listener, but tracks like “Famous” and his always-controversial Twitter feed bring his self-awareness into question.I did not diss Taylor Swift and I’ve never dissed her…— KANYE WEST (@kanyewest) February 12, 2016There are a few other interesting bits and moments on the record, but that’s all they are: moments – essentially demos. One solid flow or beat doesn’t make a two-minute track worthwhile, and it definitely doesn’t make the listener forget about all the pretentious triteness they had to sit through to get to it. Take “30 Hours” for example; West produces one of the best beats on the record, but then squanders it by making it an impromptu outro, leaving in terrible freestyle rapping and even taking a phone call while the beat loops for over five minutes. West may have thought throwing an outro three tracks from the end to be innovative, but it isn’t; it’s a waste of time.


 


The most successful thing West did with ""TLOP"" was create an immense amount of hype surrounding it. From changing the album title four times to the leaking the album artwork, he masterfully hooked his fans. And if he's really in $53 million of debt, West better hope releasing it solely on Tidal will pay off. I write this to you my brothers while still 53 million dollars in personal debt... Please pray we overcome... This is my true heart...— KANYE WEST (@kanyewest) February 14, 2016In the end, there are only five or six tracks even remotely worth returning to. The rest are just interesting ideas or moments that needed more time to develop or needed to be incorporated differently.Yeezy may think he’s the savior and king of the music industry, but he has way more in common with a zombie – a shell of his former self, unable to see that he’s not doing anything that different from everyone else around him.",Zach Hansen @zach_ehansen,culture,https://www.redandblack.com/culture/yeezus-rose-from-the-grave-a-zombie-not-savior/article_cfdb6b0a-d4ff-11e5-ba91-77573e8635af.html
18-Feb-16,New indoor practice facility to benefit track athletes,"While Kirby Smart drew the attention of donors at the indoor practice facility’s groundbreaking ceremony Tuesday, head track coach Petros Kyprianou stood among the crowd in near anonymity.Kyprianou smiled as people flocked across the practice field to catch Smart, athletic director Greg McGarity and University of Georgia President Jere Morehead. He may not be the headliner in a who’s who of Georgia athletic figures, but the veteran coach realizes this day is just as big for him as any of his colleagues.The university’s new indoor practice facility has been identified by many as the football team’s biggest addition. While the $30 million project was put in place to benefit the football team, the facility also offers advantages to other teams. In addition to batting cages for the baseball and softball teams, there’s a 65-meter track runway and jumping pits.


 


For Kyprianou, these new advantages induce a sigh of relief.“My IQ has improved by 20 points in the past seven years trying to improvise where to train and how to train,” Kyprianou said.Kyprianou explained he’s been part of different training situations throughout his track career. During his youth in northern Greece, the thought of an indoor facility was far-fetched; instead, he dealt with winter weather and rainy conditions without a second thought. He coached at Nebraska without an indoor facility and later spent time at Boise State with one, which helped him prepare for both situations.As useful as the facility will soon be for athletes, it’s already become a draw for the track team’s recruiting targets.Kyprianou said the top sprinters in the world get to be picky with where they choose to go to college. They opt to target schools with state-of-the-art facilities. Chief among those are indoor training grounds — an advantage that not all teams are afforded.Although the construction will not be completed until January 2017, the facility has already become a key component in Kyprianou’s recruiting pitches.“We’ve had a couple of world-level recruits, and we’ve already shown them the photos and the pictures and all that,” Kyprianou said. “They’re already aware. We’ve been selling this facility for a good bit now.” 


 


Photo by Garrett LeffelmanKyprianou’s joy did not go unnoticed by McGarity. The athletic director spoke on the excellent job the first-year head coach has done with the track program and how this building can further his efforts.McGarity mentioned the value the facility holds for track athletes, who are prone to injuries when working solely outside.“A lot of athletes are like thoroughbreds,” McGarity said. “They’re very easily tweaked.”Kendell Williams can attest to that. Instead of having a football player speak at the ceremony, the junior track and field standout was chosen. She spoke about her excitement at having a new facility, which will be ready for the end of her senior season.

20-Feb-16,Georgia congressman reminds students of inspiration in Holmes-Hunter Lecture,"A crowd gathered to listen as Sanford D. Bishop Jr., United States congressman from Georgia, delivered the 2016 Holmes-Hunter Lecture in the chapel on Feb. 18.A notable proponent of civil rights, the congressman for Georgia’s second district joined the ranks of other leaders who had preceded him in this honor. In the past many influential icons of the civil rights movement have delivered the lecture, including Andrew Young and Charlayne Hunter-Gault herself.


 


The lecture is an annual event commemorating the achievements of Hamilton Holmes and Charlayne Hunter-Gault as the first black students to enroll at the University of Georgia.Before his lecture, Bishop was introduced by freshman Ammishaddai Grand-Jean, a political science and economics double major from Jonesboro.Grand-Jean said Bishop was “a public servant, outstanding leader, and a role model for his generation.” “The impact of their courage has made them true icons of American history,” Bishop said of Holmes and Hunter-Gault.Bishop gave great deference to God and to the people who walked before him and helped him achieve his success.“The steps of the righteous are ordered by God, I truly believe that their steps were ordered, as are mine,” Bishop said.The congressman described his Alabama upbringing, and his first interactions with the painful realities of segregation.“Growing up, living in an all black part of town, I didn’t understand the concept of race,” Bishop said, “but as I got older I experienced first hand the burning of crosses in my neighborhood.”


 


He told the stories that inspired him, in the hope that they might inspire those gathered to hear him speak.He recalled his father speaking to him following the announcement of the Brown v. Board of Education decision.“My father turned to me and said ‘son, things are going to change, you’ll have opportunities that we never had, but you have to be ready’,” Bishop said.Bishop closed by quoting a poem called ""Bag of Tools"" and encouraged the audience to remember every person has skills that can help their fellow man. “You have to keep passing on the flame, it was a great motivation and I want to share it with more people,” Grand-Jean said.","Harrison Young

21-Feb-16,Super Bowl halftime performance was inappropriate for audience,"This article is part of a dueling column. See the opposing view here. Super Bowl 50 had little to offer in the way of excitement. The gameplay was robotic and lacked for suspense. Worst of all, even the commercials were boring and uninspired.Halftime proved to be just as bland and forgettable with rock band Coldplay playing its overplayed hits and a muted Bruno Mars refusing to leave “Uptown Funk” in 2015. 


 


To the chagrin of many football fans, Beyoncé spiced up halftime with a new performance of her song “Formation.” During the performance, a group of her backup dancers wore Black Panther Party uniforms in a tribute to Malcolm X.I cannot imagine the notoriously large Super Bowl audience felt an aura of inclusivity when it saw the Super Bowl become another political message with supporters of a group like the Black Panthers, a group that — though not purely revolutionary — still condoned and engaged in violence. This is the latest push in the Black Lives Matter movement, a movement without substance or a comprehensive picture of the issues that are being pushed and endorsed by celebrities like Beyoncé. Black Lives Matter’s assumption that police officers are hunting poor black citizens for slaughter is statistically not true. According to The Guardian’s shooting database, 303 of the 1,140 people killed by police in 2015 were African-American. That accounts for about 26 percent of all cop killings, which is well behind the amount of whites killed by police, at more than 65 percent. The idea that there is institutionalized racism in America today is statistically and legally not true. If there is an individual racist or race-based law, then I agree it should be done away with completely. However, the only race-based laws in America today are actually in favor of minorities, from affirmative action to government-subsidized mortgages for people with bad credit. The blame in the political climate likes to be put on people with little responsibility in the matter, such as right-wing individuals. Vice President Joe Biden said in 2012 that the Republican Party would put black people back in chains. Kanye West said after Hurricane Katrina that George Bush did not care about black people. Michael Moore and Hillary Clinton demagogue about the Flint, Michigan, water crisis and rest sole blame on Gov. Rick Snyder.It does not matter to Kanye West that Ray Nagin and Kathleen Blanco, both Democrats, refused a mandatory evacuation up until a day before the hurricane and left more than 100 buses to collect rainwater instead of busing people out. The African-American community keeps ignoring that Flint, Michigan, has been run into the ground by Democrats for 30 years until an emergency manager, also a Democrat, followed through on a decision endorsed by the city council and mayor to switch water sources in order to create more union jobs and stimulus. Facts do not matter to any of these race-baiting people, who would turn the complex issues of race in America into a political line in the sand. They would stop voting for politicians who have turned well-managed and safe cities like Ferguson, Missouri, into wastelands filled with corruption and racism. Beyoncé should prove that black lives truly matter to her by no longer campaigning for the people who have made black lives worse. Instead of a show at the Super Bowl, work to change the law and the politicians who think black lives only matter in order to keep them employed for another four years.

22-Feb-16,Hansen's Hits: Feb. 22,"In a week where Kanye West finally decided to drop his long awaited album, the week ironically was not all that kind to male artists or rap. Like Beyoncé, since West didn’t put his album on Spotify, no song will appear from “The Life of Pablo,” and no other rapper that I could find dropped an album this week. However, female artists and lead vocalists made up for it by comprising 80 percent of this list and giving everyone some great tracks to listen to during a pretty thin release week.Basia Bulat – “Long Goodbye”Bulat’s melodic indie-pop sound produced one of the best albums this week, and the easy standout track was “Long Goodbye.” With a fantastic hook paired with an energetic bass line, this track makes saying goodbye to a former lover not seem like the end of the world, even if the singer is still mentally trying to cope with the aftermath.


 


Radiation City – “Oil Show”The instrumentals of this track may be my favorite this week, as the drum pattern has a lot of groove while the underlying static electronics and meaty bass line carry the track. The vocals add to the atmosphere, especially the background crooning, but I could honestly just listen to the well-crafted instrumentals alone.The Suffers – “Dutch”Horns make this track. Sure the vocals are above par, but the brasswork adds a great funk and jazz element that completely overshadows the vocals. The saxophone solo near the end is an especially high point of the track, and the speedy percussion backing it provides a great template for the horns to build upon.Lissie – “Stay”From the depths of an underwhelming, boring album, Lissie’s “Stay” finally capitalizes on the Western theme of the album with plucked banjo notes, a rumbling train beat and bluesy vocals. Easily Lissie’s best vocal performance on the album, she carries the first half of the track up until the instrumental climax.Vince Gill – “Me And My Girl”If it weren’t for the bouncy bass and tinny drums, this would be an actual genuine country track on this list. However, while it is a little too poppy, it still does what it does well. Vince Gill’s voice sounds authentic and carries emotion and the guitar work near the end is truly a highlight of the track.


 


Flowers – “Pull My Arm”One of Flowers’ heavier tracks, “Pull My Arm” has a great, syncopated snare pattern back by a frantic bass pattern. Once the guitars come in near the chorus, the track’s energy intensifies to a satisfying climax, which highlights the lead vocal’s great melody.The Jezabels – “My Love Is My Disease”The drums are again the focal point of this song, with a rollicking pattern that never lets up throughout the track. The lead singer’s falsetto on the last note of each phrase of the chorus is a great addition that helps the track distinguish itself from the rest of The Jezabels’ album.Motorpsycho – “Lacuna/Sunrise”A long, slow build, Motorpsycho isn’t nearly as heavy or intense as the group’s name may imply. This track is much more reminiscent of late ‘60s progressive rock groups like Pink Floyd with an ever-changing chord structure interspersed with multiple solos, verses and bridges.Rokia Traoré – “Tu Voles”I don’t speak French, but that doesn’t stop me from enjoying Malian world artist Rokia Traoré. The flow of the vocals sounds nice and matches the slight funk feel the guitar provides. The guitar work especially keeps me coming back with a captivating chord progression and a catchy chorus, even if I have no idea what “Tu Voles” actually means.

Lacey Sturm – “The Soldier”The lead singer of Flyleaf, Lacey Sturm, released her first solo album “Life Screams” this week, and a couple of tracks bring me back to my middle school rocker-phase, which Flyleaf was a frequent part of. While a shallow track upon multiple listens, “The Soldier” provides an energetic chorus that’s sure to make it onto my workout playlist.",Zach Hansen @zach_ehansen,culture,https://www.redandblack.com/culture/hansen-s-hits-feb/article_61aa22be-d993-11e5-bc51-c37d79e74074.html
23-Feb-16,Williams siblings resist rivalry nature in competition,"Every sports team is said to operate like a family, but as for Georgia’s track and field team, this family is closer than you think.Kendell and Devon Williams, brother and sister, are only a year apart and are multi-event athletes on the Georgia team.“We are not competitive at all with each other,” Devon said.


 


The Williams siblings say they get the competitive question from everyone, but they believe they have no reason to be. Devon is a 2015 first team All-American with a career high 7,341 points in the decathlon. Devon's younger sister Kendell is a two-time NCAA Indoor champion in the pentathlon.Both Kendell and Devon began track at a young age, joining the same team at ages 6 and 7, respectively. They have been on the same team ever since.After finding success at Kell High School in Marietta, Devon brought his talents to Georgia in 2012. Soon after, Kendell followed suit.“I got to see him in his first year and see how [head coach] Petros [Kyprianou] improved on his skills,” Kendell said. “I knew that Petros could do a lot with me.”Devon had no problem with his younger sister coming to school with him.“I would say I’ve had influence on her, but it was her decision in the end,” Devon said. “Naturally, it was more comfortable for her to want to come here and be able to go through her college career knowing she has her brother for support.”It’s all about support for the Williams siblings in the end. With both doing multi-events, the pressure from multiple events and practices can get intense.


 


“Doing these events take a lot, but family helps you stay grounded and is an added support system,” Kendell said.On the track they may not be competitive, but off, when the pair return home for the holidays, Phase 10 is the game of choice. When they were little, Devon and Kendell would pull out the deck of 108 cards and play several rounds of the card game.“The whole family is competitive at Phase 10,” Devon said. “Me, Kendell, my mom and my grandma would sit around the table and play for hours.”“He would win most of the time,” Kendell said.But winning is nothing new to both siblings. Head coach Petros Kyprianou has seen the progress made by both athletes since their arrival.“Kendell and Devon are both strong competitors in the perspective events,” Kyprianou said. “We can’t really compare them by events but they are both strong in their events.”Although Kendell has racked up plenty of outdoor and indoor championships, she still considers her brother the better competitor.“Devon is the better competitor,"" Kendell said. ""Ten events is so hard on the body. He would take the trophy in that.”

23-Feb-16,Athens follows Georgia trend of lower traffic fatalities in first month of 2016,"According to the AAA press release, traffic fatalities are down 17 percent with 100 accidents this year through Feb. 3, 20 fewer accidents than last year. Lieutenant Don Eckert with the Athens-Clarke County Police Traffic Division had similar numbers.“As of [Feb. 16], traffic fatalities are down 19 percent,"" he said. “There’s 135 this year compared to 166 this time last year.""However, Eckert said these numbers are not entirely conclusive and that the numbers fluctuate all the time. He said the numbers could be down because of increased safety precautions or because last year was a bad year for traffic fatalities.


 


“Like last year, when they went up and we were on that upward trend. And we don’t have that trend this year,” Eckert said. “Athens hasn’t had any so far this year.”Athens-Clarke County police are currently in year two of their three-year H.E.A.T. grant funded by the Georgia Governor's Office of Highway Safety. Eckert said he would like to believe that the reason traffic fatalities are down are because of their efforts to combat DUI-related fatalities and traffic fatalities in general.“We’ve been trying to combat it to get [the number of traffic fatalities] down,” he said. “The Department of Highway Safety noticed that the trend was unusually high last year in comparison to previous years, so next year we hope to combat it even further.”Traffic fatalities have been a statewide issue, according to Eckert, who said the Governor's Office of Highway Safety has worked with several departments and agencies within the state to work towards the collective goal of decreasing the number of fatalities.""They do different proportional efforts statewide to try and combat it,” he said. “Like with the H.E.A.T. grant, they travel around the state and work with the different agencies on things like vehicle checks.”Eckert said there is no way to predict where the percentage of traffic fatalities will go each year, and the most they can do is use funding like the H.E.A.T. grant to educate and enforce traffic safety laws.The AAA press release said that although traffic fatalities are down, drivers should still take precaution on the road.""Any number of fatalities are too many, so AAA encourages all drivers to stay alert and keep Georgia roadways safe,” said Garrett Townsend, Georgia AAA public affairs director. “We've seen an improvement so far this year, but we have a long way to go. We just ask all motorists to stay focused while behind the wheel, and hopefully we can reduce this deadly trend.""


 


Peyton Hosier, a sophomore early childhood education major from Suwanee who transferred from Georgia Southern University, said traffic fatalities should be a big concern for college students.""I was just talking to a friend about the accident involving the Georgia Southern students,” she said, referring to a multiple-vehicle accident on I-16 in April that killed five nursing students. “One of them, Emily, was my friend. But everyone kind of knows each other down there. It is the very scary reality that no one ever thinks it could happen to them.”Hosier said she often thinks about how the five students had their own lives and loved ones.“They had lives just like us. They had boyfriends and a career ahead of them to save lives and a family. They were someone’s daughter and someone’s friend,” she said. “Just as quick as something can be given to you, it can be taken away.”Hosier said it is important for students to realize there is never a reason to text and drive. The driver of the tractor-trailer involved in the Georgia Southern crash later admitted under oath to texting while driving at the time of the accident.“Literally in the blink of an eye, your life and someone else’s can end in a second,” Hosier said. “It’s actually really selfish, because you’re basically saying, ‘Yeah, I know the law, but it doesn’t apply to me. I won’t get in a crash.’""Hosier said the Georgia Southern community banded together after the accident, especially the smaller Greek community.“I think it was a wake up call for so many people. It was really nice to see the entire Greek community come together,” she said. “Greek or non-Greek, we all lost someone.”

Hosier said it is important to cherish others everyday.“Everyone always uses the phrase, ‘Hug the ones you love and don’t ever take any of it for granted,’ and this is one of the truest testaments I’ve ever found,"" she said.","Charlotte Norsworthy

25-Feb-16,Q&A;: Blues legend Booker T. Jones as dedicated to music as ever,"With four Grammy Awards and a spot in the Rock & Roll Hall Of Fame, Booker T. Jones, 71-year-old frontman and organ player for Booker T. & the M.G.’s will be performing with special guest Jay Gonzalez at The Foundry on Feb. 27 at 8 p.m. The Red & Black chatted with Jones about his excitement for the upcoming show, views on today’s musical scene and the relationships that made his career possible.The Red & Black: Right now, you are doing a collaboration with Jay Gonzalez. How did that start up?Booker T. Jones: Jay Gonzalez is an old friend of mine from Drive-By Truckers. I’m a fan of his. Great keyboard player. We met doing a live performance of the Drive-By Truckers. Pretty sure we met backstage.


 


R&B: Do you normally keep up with the music scene today?B.T.J.: I try to. There’s so much music.R&B: Do you like the music scene today? Is there still good music coming out?B.T.J.: I still listen to a lot of older music. I still listen to my first Jimmy Smith record. I still listen to a lot of the blues I loved. I like some of the new stuff. I like Deadmau5. I listen to a lot of the new online radio streaming stuff. There’s such a wide variety available now.R&B: Why were you so passionate for music early on? Why did you decide to learn so many instruments and study music so much?B.T.J.: It just seemed to be part of me. It wasn’t really a choice. I guess I could have chosen something like science or something. It was part of my makeup. My mother played piano and sang. It was inspirational to hear her and great to be her son. I think I try to emulate how she played all my life.""I would like to be described as the man who made “Green Onions” and the guy who gave people a lot of pleasure and a lot of fun.""


 


R&B: Was she supportive of you going into music?B.T.J.: She was. She bought me every instrument they could afford. They got a ukulele downtown at the five-and-dime. I learned the chords off the box of the ukulele. She sold a piano. They were poor. I cried so hard that she brought the piano back. My dad was, too. My dad drove my little band around when I was in high school in West Memphis to our gigs. He was a teacher and had to get up early, but he still stayed with us and all that.R&B: You left Stax Records in 1971. In your newest album, you came back. Why did you decide to leave that record label and then come back?B.T.J.: That was a difficult decision. The label that I left was not the same Stax record that I started with in 1961. When I was in high school, I was going there after school, and we were just playing music after school and getting five or 10 bucks. Maybe 15 for playing on sessions. Booker T. & the M.G.’s had a hit in 1962. I took off to Indiana to study music from ‘62 to ‘66. During that period, the company grew and new people came on. By 1968, it was a pretty big company and they started doing things differently. They sold the company to Gulf+Western in New York City. It was an emotional decision, but California was the land of promises for me. I met Herb Alpert down there and played with Bobby Darin out there. It just drew me away. I wanted to do different kinds of music. I didn’t always want to do the R&B. I loved that music so much, but there was strictness at Stax.R&B: Was commercial success ever important to you?B.T.J.: I think it was important because I needed to make a living. I really think I honestly cared more about making music than being commercially successful. I think we were just really lucky to have commercial success.


TNCMS.AdManager.render({region: 'fixed-big-ad-bottom-asset', slot: 1, fold: ""below""});


R&B: At what point did you realize you were popular? That Booker T. & the M.G.’s was a big band?B.T.J.: That happened on two different scales. Popularity to us, being played outside of Memphis, was a pretty big success. But then it happened on a different scale when we went to London and we played at Finsbury Park. And there were not 300 or 400 people, there were thousands of people there. That was really an eye-opener.R&B: Was there anybody in particular you really enjoyed working with?B.T.J.: So many. Starting with Albert King in St. Louis. He played my first blues song. I loved the blues so much. But I began to like the song “I’m A Lonely Man” by Albert King. That was a real thrill. Otis Redding was a constant joy to work with.R&B: Was there anybody you would have like to collaborate with in music that you never did?B.T.J.: I never worked with The Beatles. I never worked with Paul Mccartney. I met John Lennon, I met George Harrison and Ringo Starr. We never did anything together.R&B: Were they nice guys?B.T.J.: Oh, yeah. George, we went to lunch together. I was trying to get Ringo to play on a session, which he wouldn’t do. He introduced me to Jim Keltner. He told me, “You don’t want me. You want to use this guy, Jim Keltner.” He’s a great drummer.

""I still listen to my first Jimmy Smith record. I still listen to a lot of the blues I loved. I like some of the new stuff. I like Deadmau5.""R&B: Did you get along with a lot of people in the music scene in California?B.T.J.: They embraced me. Leon Russell took me in and let me stay at his house. Quincy [Jones] took me under his wing and showed me the time and the movies and introduced me to all kinds of people. Quincy was like a mentor, like a father in a way. So many people like that in California. Gene Page. Bobby Darin. In California, I could just walk into the studio and record. It was a good time for me.R&B: Maurice White, one of the lead singers of Earth, Wind, and Fire passed away a few months ago. Did you know him at all personally?B.T.J.: My father packed Maurice’s first set of drums into his old ’49 Ford and brought it from Beale Street to Maurice’s apartment a few blocks away from our house. That’s how close we were. First set of drums that we got on time, and we carried it up the steps to his apartment. Yep, I knew him.R&B: Why did you decide to stick with music for so long?

B.T.J.: When I woke up this morning, that’s what was on my mind and that’s how it’s been my whole life. I have other things that I’m interested in, but that’s what’s on my mind. I hear music in my mind. I dream music.R&B: How do you make a song? What is your musical process?B.T.J.: It’s not set. It varies with the song. It varies with the style, the instruments. I go from simple ideas. Maybe a voice to a guitar. Maybe an organ, soulful arrangements. And now that I’ve heard a lot of dance music, I sometimes want to remix songs that I hear.R&B: So you’re big in the electronic dance scene and dubstep?B.T.J.: I am. I’ve been sort of a synthesizer guy since the first time I’ve started playing my Hammond Organ. My Hammond organ is basically a big synthesizer.R&B: What would you like your impact for music to be? Fifty years from now, when people talk about Booker T. Jones, how would you like them to describe you?B.T.J.: I would like to be described as the man who made “Green Onions” and the guy who gave people a lot of pleasure and a lot of fun. That’s the reason for it.",Matthew Kopf,culture,https://www.redandblack.com/culture/q-a-blues-legend-booker-t-jones-as-dedicated-to/article_cccb5240-d9c3-11e5-b4e4-e7224ebf6087.html
26-Feb-16,Georgia rides big nights from four players to victory over Arkansas,"On Thursday, Georgia women’s basketball fans got a first look at a Shacobia Barbee-less UGA squad.After a rough start, the Lady Bulldogs gave those fans a reason to believe they can win without their star guard, as they beat the Arkansas Razorbacks 72-57 in Stegeman Coliseum.It would have been a lot to ask of a single player to pick up the burden of Barbee’s absence. Instead, the team shared it. 


 


Four different Lady Bulldogs scored double-digit points, including Merritt Hempe (18), Tiaria Griffin (15), Caliya Robinson (14), and Pachis Roberts (12). That combined with 22 minutes and six points out of reserve Haley Clark was enough to fill the hole Barbee left in Georgia’s lineup.In addition to being the first game without Barbee, it was also Georgia’s last home game of the season. That made it the last time the seniors on the team would play in front of the Georgia crowd.Hempe, a senior, was proud of the last impression she and her teammates left on the court.“We want to make sure people don’t come in here and walk in and think that they can come in and win games,” Hempe said. “We defend our home court.”Georgia did end up defending the home court, but the team did not get off to a great start. After scoring the first basket of the game, the Lady Bulldogs allowed Arkansas to make an 8-0 run, putting the home team in an early hole. Georgia struggled to get anything going in the quarter, failing to make a single 3-point shot. It entered the second quarter losing 14-8.Georgia kept pace with Arkansas for the remainder of the half. It cut the deficit to four points a couple of times, but each time the Razorbacks went on a run of their own and widen their lead.As the half wound down, a timely 5-0 run by Georgia brought the Lady Bulldogs within two. They went into the break trailing 26-24 but knowing they weren’t playing their best basketball yet.“We had to settle in,” Taylor said. “We just weren’t settled the first and second quarters.”


 


The second half began with more sluggish play from Georgia on both sides of the ball. But midway through the quarter, a blocked shot by Caliya Robinson followed by a made basket by Robinson infused the team with some energy. A flurry of layups from Robinson, Hempe, and Tiaria Griffin to end the quarter put the Lady Bulldogs up 45-42 going into the final frame.From there, Arkansas just didn’t have enough left to stay with Georgia. Robinson had a huge quarter including success in the paint and from beyond the arc, hitting Georgia’s first 3-point shot of the night with about seven minutes left in the game.Good defense and made free throws were enough to keep the momentum in Georgia’s favor, as it finished the Razorbacks off 72-57.Georgia will play its final game of the season when it goes on the road to take on Tennessee on Sunday, Feb. 28. Tip-off will be at 1 p.m.","Nathan Berg

27-Feb-16,Bulldogs to Brazil: Jamaican track athletes Ashinia Miller and Chanice Porter aim for Rio,"He’s a 6-foot-3, 275 pound senior, someone who looks like he should be starting for Kirby Smart in the fall. But instead of protecting a quarterback, Ashinia Miller throws shot put for Georgia’s track and field team.People respect Miller. It may have something to do with his intimidating stature. It also may have something to do with the fact that he truly has their best interest at heart and they know that.“People always follow me or ask me for advice,” Miller said. “I would never tell anybody to do something bad. I always give people good advice, even if they’re my rival. I just can’t sleep not giving good advice or not telling the truth.”


 


And that’s what brought senior jumper Chanice Porter to Georgia. The first time she saw Georgia’s campus was after she was enrolled in classes.Miller and Porter are both from the same area in Jamaica. They went to different high schools, but were able to form a bond after making several national teams together. So Porter, without ever visiting the university, depended on Miller to offer good advice on whether or not she should come to Georgia.“She’s like a little sister to me,” Miller said.Georgia was the first school Miller visited. And it ended up being the last. Porter trusted his instincts after he told her that he loved the campus, the atmosphere, the facilities and even the dorm rooms.“When I came here the facilities felt like I was in heaven,” Miller said.Despite offers from several other schools, most of which came from the Southeastern Conference, both Miller and Porter came to Georgia to compete collegiately.Porter has always been fast and considers herself a good runner, but was by chance that she ended up jumping. She comes from a school in Jamaica that had a lot of runners, so her coach moved some of the athletes around to different events.Porter was first sent to hurdles and she quickly realized it wasn’t for her. So she was sent to high jump and long jump, both of which she did well in. After her first competition jumping, she remembers being pleased with her performance.


 


“It was a good experience because a lot of people saw my potential and saw what I could do,” Porter said. “So a lot of coaches were watching me to see what I could do the next year because they saw the ability I had jumping.”For Miller, it was much of the same. By chance, his coach at school saw him and asked him to do some pushups. His coach was impressed and told him he should go to the gym.Miller said he didn’t know what shot put was when his coach mentioned it to him. He also admits that one of the reasons he went to the gym like his coach asked was to work on his summer body. He soon figured out what shot put was and began to throw with some of the other athletes.Now that Miller and Porter are both seniors, they are attempting to qualify for the 2016 Olympics in Rio de Janeiro. They are well on their way to making it, too.Miller said he feels ready for competition and knows that he has the ability to qualify for the Olympics. But he is worried about letting the nerves of competing and the possibility of going to Rio de Janeiro get in his way.“I’m kind of anxious because I want to do so well,” Miller said. “I think I can be a world-class thrower if I just get my mind together, my body together and just do it and stop thinking about it.”Porter’s goal is to qualify for long jump. There has recently been a coaching change for jumping events at Georgia, and the change seems to be paying off. She has already beaten her previous records in the high and long jump this season. She’s hoping to jump the qualifying 6.70 meters in this season’s first outdoor competition so she will automatically qualify for the trip to Rio de Janeiro.Head track and field coach Petros Kyprianou sees the ability in both to make it to the Olympics, and has enjoyed coaching them. 


TNCMS.AdManager.render({region: 'fixed-big-ad-bottom-asset', slot: 1, fold: ""below""});


There’s something special about these two specific athletes. They have gained his respect in a way that some athletes may not be able to.“From my experience of being a coach for 20 years, I hear kids talking about the Road to Rio,” Kyprianou said. “I respect the kids who put in the work without talking.”Because of this, Kyprianou believes that they both will make it to the Olympics and get to represent their home country of Jamaica.“That’s what I really like about both of them,” Kyprianou said. “They don’t talk, they’re just hard workers and they show up and do their job.”","Layne Saliba

28-Feb-16,Hands Like Houses's 'Dissonants' dynamic but lacks diversity,"Post-hardcore band Hands Like Houses adds a third album to its discography with the release of “Dissonants” whose only shortcoming lies in its lack of tempo diversity.“Dissonants” immediately captures the attention of the audience with its utilization of a fictitious word as the title. Dissonant is an adjective used to describe clashing or unharmonious sounds and the word dissonance is the said lack of harmony. What’s particularly peculiar about the album’s name then is that it is itself discordant, or dissonant. The title “Dissonants” implies a play upon incongruity – since it is not a real word, it is neither an adjective nor a noun and suggests the album’s refusal to be categorized.The first track on the album, “I Am,” is either a continuation of the album title, or a response to it. It reads either as “I Am” dissonant or “I Am” dissonance. Either way, the implication is that the album, and the band, is rebelling against the expected harmony of music. A line repeated throughout the song reads, “I am not the same, I won't feed on fame.” This phrase emphasizes the clashing values of the band and the music industry and portrays the band as another similar sounding word – a dissenter.


 


The track with one of the best listening experiences on the album is “Motion Sickness.” The emphasis on the pounding of the drum has a solidifying effect, grounding the listener in the rhythm. This contrasts with the title “Motion Sickness” which suggests a lack of balance and stability.However, the song soon provides the churning rush associated with motion sickness. The song slows in pace and the backing music fades leaving only echoes and quiet electronic sounds that slip through the listener’s mind. One line reads “the world is spinning and I am standing still,” and in this idea, motion sickness is conveyed as a sensation akin the world rapidly turning on its axis. The song then quickly picks back up and throws the listener into the agitated spinning once again.   “Grey Havens” is the most engaging song lyrically in its grappling with the concept of death and afterlife. One of the most poignant lyrics reads, “I don't know which way to fall into Infinity.” The song addresses the confusion and lack of understanding of what comes after death as the line, “I'm afraid of being oblivious to oblivion,” exemplifies. The anxiety provoked by thoughts of mortality arises again in the line “will it feel like waking up, or falling back to dream” and conveys a fear of the unknown. Collectively “Dissonants” needs a larger diversity in the tempo of the songs as all of the tracks were either medium or fast paced thus mitigating some of their impact. Despite this, “Dissonants” each song is individually dynamic and a select few are exceedingly successful in composing grand and interesting ideas which are emphasized by the enrapturing music.",Anna Haas @TeacupAnna,culture,https://www.redandblack.com/culture/hands-like-houses-s-dissonants-dynamic-but-lacks-diversity/article_cb2d66f2-de56-11e5-8364-aff0673f0435.html
1-Mar-16,If SEC football coaches were candidates in the 2016 election,"Tuesday’s Republican and Democratic primaries were aptly dubbed the SEC primaries since seven southern states are participating. The loose tie-in with the Southeastern Conference got us thinking: Which remaining presidential candidates match with the SEC’s colorful coaches?Below are our choices.    


 


Photo by Christina CannonAlabama head coach Nick Saban is Hillary Clinton. You know what you’re going to get from both Saban and Clinton. Both have been in their business for a long time. The two also serve as the perpetual favorites, leaving them as the main target for the competition. They may not be well liked by everyone, but no one can deny their power.Both have their fair share of critics. Saban has been caught in a lie before, and Clinton has been hounded for several political controversies. Saban has been able to persevere and establish one of the greatest college football dynasties ever. Only time will tell if Clinton can make history by becoming the first female president.— Zach Shugan @ZachShugan


 


Photo by Erin O. SmithOle Miss head coach Hugh Freeze is Bernie Sanders.Like Sanders with Clinton, Freeze appears to be the only one capable of beating Saban, having done so two years in a row. No one thought a lowly high school coach would go on to compete with some of the conference’s best coaches, much like people discounted the Vermont senator’s chances last fall.Plus, people sure do love to talk about the money that funds their causes.— Jordan D.

He also turned LSU’s most important officials against him, which almost led to his dismissal. There is a visceral reaction to him and what he does and says.The same can be said for Ted Cruz, whose supporters are fiercely loyal. Those who don’t like him feel about the same as Miles’ bosses did not so long ago.— Evan Greenberg @EvanGreenberg8

Both Rubio and Jones bring youth and excitement but are also known to rely on their scripts too heavily.There’s also the issue of being on the verge of success, as the Volunteers have been on the edge of a defining moment only to let it slip away. Sounds a lot like Rubio, who has a penchant to claim runner-up and third-place finishes as victories.— Zach Shugan @ZachShugan

Photo by Christina CannonKentucky head coach Mark Stoops is John Kasich.Stoops, like Kasich, has flashes of success that makes onlookers think he’s turned a corner. This happened the last two seasons, as the Wildcats started the season hot only to disappear when it really mattered.Both men’s value comes from situations outside their control; Stoops was considered a good hire because of the success of his brother Bob at Oklahoma, while Kasich is coveted because of the weight his home state holds come Election Day.Ten years from now, few will recall what Stoops and Kasich were doing in 2016.

But once fall 2015 rolled around, both men appeared to be doing their jobs with their eyes closed.Also, Carson’s polling near-even with Kasich in Carson’s native Michigan is the equivalent of going to overtime with Jacksonville State.

Trump is leading most Super Tuesday polls, and Bielema won conference championships at Wisconsin and has led Arkansas to bowl game wins the past two seasons.

The duo enjoys calling out their adversaries, and both love accusations. Bielema weirdly and backhandedly accused Florida of recruiting violations when he praised their 2016 recruiting class. Trump accused Ted Cruz of voter fraud in Iowa when he and his clementine hair came in second in the caucus.Bielema is a man concerned with the image of his university, what others around him are doing and how he fits within that.

1-Mar-16,The 1975’s new album difficult to dislike,"In 2013, The 1975 exploded on the pop music scene with their first album, a self-titled LP that was heavily praised due to its combination of dark themes with youthful carelessness.The band’s sophomore album, titled “I Like It When You Sleep, for You Are So Beautiful Yet So Unaware of It” was released on Feb. 26, and it again succeeds despite carrying a similar theme of darkness and sin.The lyrics permeating the album are, at times, so satirical and unashamedly self-absorbed that they should be nauseating, and yet The 1975 manages to execute a bubblegum-pop delivery so flawless that all offenses are forgiven.


 


After opening with a short, self-titled track, the album get’s it’s true start with the first single released, “Love Me.” The track is an obvious head nod to “Fame” by David Bowie and carries a level of funk not found in previous releases by the band. This is the perfect delivery for the almost satirical lyrics found in singer Matty Healy’s own version of social criticism, in which he references his “Friends online” and boldly utters lines such as, “You look famous, let’s be friends / and portray we possess something important.” This idea of shallow, self-absorption is found in various other tracks throughout the album. In “UGH!,” Healy sings, “This conversation's not about reciprocation no more / But I'm gon' wait until you finish so I can talk some more,” and in “The Sound,” there is no mistaking Healy when he sings, “It's not about reciprocation it's just all about me / A sycophantic, prophetic, Socratic junkie wannabe.”Despite the lyrics, the tracks are truly difficult to dislike due to The 1975’s ability to make something horrible sound amazing with their infectious dance rhythms and endearing Manchester accents.Other tracks contain the band’s signature darkness through offensive themes. In “Loving Someone,” Healy repeatedly references selling one’s body for sex and the lyrics in “She’s American” play at a stereotype of foolish American women with lines such as, “If she likes it cause we just don't eat / And we're socially relevant, she's American.” These offenses are quickly forgiven through a unique, rapped delivery in the former and the unforgettable, catchy hook in the latter.The 1975 has never shied away from creating music that verges on offensive, and they took it to a new level in “I Like It When You Sleep ....” For many other bands the lyrics and themes explored in this album would be much too risky, but The 1975 yet again stepped up to the challenge and succeeded in creating a likeable album despite lyrics that would suggest otherwise.",Emma Korstanje @EmmaKorstanje,culture,https://www.redandblack.com/culture/the-s-new-album-difficult-to-dislike/article_5c593bc0-df0f-11e5-b743-afd93fbf62f8.html
1-Mar-16,'Gods of Egypt' flops spectacularly,"There is a special type of cinematic flop wherein the enormous budget of a film is not strong enough to overcome the many ingredients spoiling the stew. The audience is left feeling not only slightly disappointed but vastly aware of the lightness of their wallet and the loss of their time. Despite a star-studded cast, a rich mythology to rely on and the incredible funds of over $140 million, “Gods of Egypt” still manages to be one of these immense failures.The 2016 fantasy romp directed by Egyptian-born Alex Proyas was met before its release with considerable criticism and contempt as a result of its whitewashed cast. The estimated $30 million funneled into marketing was not enough to overcome the uneasiness felt as a result of the overwhelmingly white cast portraying the denizens of Egypt.This unsettled feeling was not eased during the movie one bit. In fact, the startling sound of Gerard Butler’s Scottish accent proclaiming the mythos of the Nile was only one such example of the out-of-place characterization.


 


The story begins with a smug Australian narration by character Bek, portrayed by Brenton Thwaites. He tells of the intermingling relationship between the gods and men, with the differences being rather minor. The ruling class of gods is considerably larger, have gold running through their veins, and from time to time shapeshift into alternative forms. These morphed beings are supposed to relate back to the animals incorporated in original Egyptian lore, but instead manifest as expensive-looking animations whose shiny metallic appearances are as out of place as their wearers.With this awkward tapestry of mythological themes, “Gods of Egypt” is the most unfortunate combination between “Aladdin” and “The Lion King” possible.Among the many flaws of “Gods of Egypt,” there are two that stand out as the least forgivable. The first is the underwhelming nature of the movie. While the dramatic action scenes and throbbing score attempt to endow suspense and interest, the best that can be said of most scenes is that there is mediocre delivery. Even a potentially terrifying monster is defeated with the tepid utterance of “Oh, bother.”The second major issue is that the movie is so stutteringly paced that it is impossible to develop any emotional attachment to the characters. The awkward banter between characters might even be somewhat endearing if only the characters were.There is some enjoyment to be had from “Gods of Egypt” if inner critics can be silenced. Beyond the convoluted plotline that involves a host of strangely presented gods and their space-boat housing, there is mindless fun in the bright imagery and occasionally funny dialogue.Still, if creativity and a high tolerance for cringe-worthy performances are in short supply, it’s probably best to visit whatever movie is playing one theater over, or better yet, stay home and watch the original Disney movies.",Laurel Hiatt @laurel_hiatt,culture,https://www.redandblack.com/culture/gods-of-egypt-flops-spectacularly/article_22353cd6-df3d-11e5-996f-670dcb8a8300.html
1-Mar-16,'Gotham' spring premiere is hot with new villain Mr. Freeze,"Commissioner James Gordon hit the screen once again for the spring premiere of “Gotham: Rise of the Villains” last night on FOX in an hour of gore and CGI ice effects.“Bad guys in this town are changing” narrated Gordon, overlapping a montage of previous footage to clue in viewers who, after waiting three months, forgot what was going on. Within the first 10 minutes the show’s latest big bad, Victor Fries, a.k.a. Mr. Freeze, appeared on screen icing a cop.The borderline-romantic relationship between GCPD forensics expert Edward Nygma and Oswald Cobblepot’s had a good moment or two. Cobblepot asking Nygma as “a dear friend” to deliver lilies to his late mother’s grave was a small tender moment between the two quirky villains, contrasting to the normal murder and mayhem they spread as the Penguin and the Riddler respectively.


 


A particularly poignant scene came as Fries consoled his terminally-ill wife. The golden lighting shone out among dark greens and moody blues characteristic of the show’s cinematography, and the delicate music playing behind his promises directly contrasted the grinding instrumentals accompanying the images of his victims’ frozen corpses.Those who follow the DC canon squealed when Dr. Hugo Strange, chief psychologist at Arkham Asylum, appeared. His bureaucratic scolding of Cobblepot, who closely resembled an angry emo teenager in prison stripes, was unsettling. The “intensive treatment programs” of rehabilitation he alludes to promise more scenes of cryptic therapy sessions and intense medical misuse at Arkham.Cringeworthy moments? Watching Tabitha Galavan call Butch Gilzean “honey bunny” and precede to straddle and kiss the steel-willed baddie into submission wasn’t so pleasant. Also having inmates respond to Cobblepot’s biting rant with prancing and cockney cries of “I’m the king of Gotham” only served to weaken one of the series’ only good remaining villains.The graphic, soupy mess that remained from an experiment gone wrong around the halfway point will leave viewers unable to to unsee the gruesome melting anytime soon. And the intense bloody eye-gouging of another character mentally swayed to “see no evil” was the final reminder in this episode that “Gotham”is not afraid to go dark in this reimagining of the Batman storyline.For a show recently lacking a good villainous presence to drive the plot, despite the inclusion of half a dozen one-episode antagonists and primary enemy Theo Galavan, the presence of a new force in Gotham is appreciated. The freeze-effects? Average. The presentation of one of the most recognizable villains in Batman lore? Humorous thanks to the mod white glasses.Overall, however, Fries brings diversity to the normal villain lineup who operate out of spite, taking motivation solely from saving his beloved wife. And the moment that she discovers the horrors of his human experimentation will no doubt provide the catalyst this character needs to evolve into the one and only Mr. Freeze.",Holly Roberts @donnovan_jade,culture,https://www.redandblack.com/culture/gotham-spring-premiere-is-hot-with-new-villain-mr-freeze/article_c40fce90-df56-11e5-bf0b-5fafb47cedb3.html
1-Mar-16,Eccentric surf rockers SEX BBQ to perform at The Globe,"Smashing together tinkling, melancholy sounds of a broken-down carnival with the twang of signature surfer tunes, SEX BBQ offers a sound not easily characterized by a single musical genre. When asked to describe the sound created by their band, members of the Athenian group had varying responses.“Remedial math rock,” joked guitarist Steve LaBate, who also compared it to Stephen King’s Dark Tower series and called it “post-apocalyptic spaghetti western fusion.”Lead vocalist and guitarist Kate Jan added “punk rock meets space and creepy carnival,” and backing vocalist and concertina player Steve Albertson contributed further to the distinctive sound  by calling it “cinematic art punk.”


 


SEX BBQ originally started after a chance meeting of Jan and LaBate at a Braves game, but evolved after the two wrote a few acoustic tracks and recruited drummer Steve Brown, bassist Everett Steele, and previous singer and keyboardist Bunny Palmer.The group got into surf punk around 2012, taking influence from groups like Street Violence, Mermaids and Ghost Bikini.“With SEX BBQ sound in mind I wrote most of our songs with incorporated punk I listened to over the years, lots riffy stuff like Dead Kennedy’s,” Jan says.SEX BBQ’s name has an equally bizarre backstory, originally starting as a joke but kept as a memorable title.“The name came from the meme going around about sex bbq, part of this post used to ‘decode your teen sex lingo,’” Albertson said.LaBate echoed, saying, “We love sex and barbeque so it’s great.”Both musicians stressed the collaborative nature of the writing process, despite each member of the band bringing distinct musical preferences, sounds and instrument types into the mix.“We got all these musicians together and inevitably everyone had different ideas on what they wanted the band to be, so it became this completely different thing once the band lineup solidified,” LaBate said.


 


Tie-ins to Athens come in inspiration with the two original female singers who would trade vocals, which LaBate compared to the B-52’s Kate Pierson and Cindy Wilson. Albertson also claims to bring elements of whimsy and creepy circus music into his work, tribute to bands Dead Milkmen and the Tiger Lillies, as well as the sounds of toy instruments, characteristic of another band CocoRosie.LaBate’s inspiration includes spaghetti-western instrumentals from composer Ennio Morricone, while Jan’s singing has characteristics of musician Juliana Hatfield.“And everybody brings attitude,” Jan says. “We speak our mind and appreciate each other's differences.”SEX BBQ’s debut album “Sex Noir City” is available online at bandcamp.com, alongside two singles “Locus of Control” and “Wake Up” previously recorded in August 2015.Each group member favors different songs, Jan claiming that “Locus of Control” is her favorite thanks to strong baselines, harmonizing and how it was fleshed out in such a dynamic way. “Fantasma” is another track highly recommended by SEX BBQ for its arrangement, and interplay between vocals and instruments.  “The vocals on ‘Future Simon’ are almost like that scene from the Dark Crystal where the little creatures get their souls sucked out,” LaBate said about a favorite track.Together the three agree that The Globe can expect an energetic and fast-paced set, with the encouragement for a lot of dancing and kissing.“It’s metaphorical bbq, because everyone is saucy,” Albertson said. “It’s prom night, we’re gonna send you off right, back off to whatever bad decisions you’re gonna make.”

7-Mar-16,Georgia diving still in full force over spring break,"The Georgia diving team has plenty at stake over the next couple of weeks.First up is the NCAA Zone B diving championships at Georgia Tech from March 7-9. If the Bulldog divers perform well there, then they have a chance at making the roster for the NCAA championship meet. The NCAA championship meet for women runs from March 16-19 and the men’s meet goes from March 23-26.Two high-pressure meets in such a short period of time is not something that worries the divers though. Having a meet during their spring break, however, does raise some concern for the hard-working student-athletes.


 


""I'm definitely excited about it,"" sophomore diver Olivia Ball said. ""It's a fun meet and there's a lot of hype. It's during spring break, which is kind of not the best, but I can't wait to get over there.""While Zones only take up three days out of the diver’s spring break, the athlete’s performance there will determine whether they will be enjoying the rest of their spring break away from a diving board or if they will continue training back at school for the NCAA championship meet.Ball will be able to enjoy her spring break after her last dive at Zones. She even has plans of her own after the meet ends.  “I think my parents are going to be in Atlanta because I’m from Ohio so they’ll come down,” Ball said. “I’ll probably spend a few days shopping and stuff like that with my mom afterward.”  If the divers finish in the top-12 in an event at the Zones, then they will have a chance to perform in that same event at the NCAA Championship meet.Finishing in the top-12 of the Zone B Diving Championship will be no easy task for the Bulldogs. In order to even participate in an event at Zones, divers must have a high qualifying score that is not attainable for the majority of divers at the NCAA level.There are five separate Zones labeled A through E. Each zone features the best divers from separate regions of the United States. Zone B has divers from the Southeastern part of the country.  At Zone B, there are 54 female and 38 male divers from 19 different colleges that have qualified in any number of the three diving events: the 1-meter, the 3-meter and the 10-meter, which is commonly referred to as platform.


 


Nine Georgia divers out of 92 will be in attendance for the meet.Georgia diving coach Dan Laak has just one goal for his nine divers heading into this meet.“Obviously we want to qualify as many as I can for NCAAs,” Laak said. “I think we can come out of there with Olivia and maybe another girl and then two guys. That would be phenomenal. We haven’t had a guy make NCAAs since 2008. It would be real exciting if we could do that.”Senior Crawford Berry's next step is not clear before Zones gets underway. He said he has a plan for whatever outcome might transpire.  “If I don’t make it, we have Thursday, Friday, Saturday off,” Berry said. “No diving, no practice. I’ll be done forever, I’ll be retired. A few of us might go up to [UGA diver] Walker’s [Wheeler] lake house. But if I do make it and anyone else makes it, then we’re here training harder than ever.”","John Durham

11-Mar-16,A look at Lent: A college student's take,"If you are confused about the black crosses adorning the foreheads of many a few Wednesdays back, do not fret—this is not a scary cult, but rather ashes that symbolize the start of a 40-day spiritual journey for many Christians. That journey is Lent, and it is a season of sacrifice and repentance leading up to the celebration of Christ’s resurrection on Easter Sunday. Many religions, including, Catholics, Orthodox Christians, and many mainline Protestants observe the Lenten season. For those unfamiliar, Lent is not a walk in the park. It involves a sacrifice of some sort as well as fasting, allowing Christians to focus their attention on God, and not on worldly desires that tend to convolute that relationship.The ashes placed on individuals to mark the start of the holiday give meaning to Ecclesiastes 3:20, which says “All are from the dust, and to dust all return.” Essentially, the ashes serve to remind Christians that God has given them life, and only souls will depart to an afterlife, all else goes to dust. It reminds individuals who recognize the holiday that life holds a greater purpose beyond monetary value or superficial detail, but instead a future inside God’s golden gates.


 


Being raised in a Catholic family, I have found lent to be extremely rewarding. It is a challenge, yet one that reminds me to be selfless and kind. This year, I have decided to give up all meat including fish, and although difficult, it reminds me of the sacrifice Christ made for me to enjoy the luxury in the first place.The history of lent resides in the forty days Jesus spent fasting in the desert in preparation for adult ministry, all the while avoiding temptation by the devil. The temptation he faced in the desert is why Christians sacrifice during Lent, so that they may be challenged by the temptations that life brings as well.Our temptations today might include a certain food, alcohol, television or technology—the list is long. These are just some examples of what Christians may abstain from during the forty days of lent. In addition, they must also refrain from eating meat on Fridays as a way to commemorate Christ’s crucifixion. Instead, they eat fish—a symbol of Christ.While a sacrifice is the go-to choice of many, Christians may also seek to do something positive each day. This can be a random act of kindness each day of Lent, saying something nice to a stranger or a promise to attend church each week—essentially a fulfillment to embody their duty as Christian.University of Georgia students who recognize Lent find it to be a positive and rewarding experience that allows them to take a step back and reflect.“I am trying my best to give up cursing because I do it often, and whenever I have the urge to curse, I’m reminded of the season,” says sophomore medias studies major Marlow Greer from Atlanta, Georgia, “I think Lent positively affects me because it helps me remember not to take simple pleasures or indulgences for granted…It’s a time to step back and really put things in perspective.”Junior marketing major Sammy Korgi from Lilburn, Georgia, is vowing to go to church each Sunday and also believes Lent to be a positive experience.“I am focusing on never complaining about anything in life, as it is too short to focus on the negatives,” says Korgi. “Lent impacts me by showing me the sacrifices God made for us to have life…it allows me to reflect on the simple things in life rather than all the extravagant things.”


 


Sophomore biochemistry major Patrick Seethaler from Nashville, Tennessee, is giving up Netflix.“It is a thing that I don’t need in my life to survive, it is a big sacrifice, and it will free up time for me to do better things like study, pray and hang out with friends,” says Seethaler. “When I am suffering from the small sacrifices I am doing, like Netflix and meat on Friday’s, I ask Jesus for help and it makes my relationship with him stronger.” For those who recognize—happy Lent! Remember the reason for the season, and how much sweeter Easter Sunday will be for you. In the meantime, I will be dreaming of a Zaxbys and Chickfila.— Cassie Daigle is a sophomore from Stone Mountain majoring in broadcast journalism Opinions expressed in The Red & Black are the opinions of the writers and not necessarily those of The Red & Black Publishing Co., Inc.

16-Mar-16,Civil rights group suggests criminal history questions on UGA applications prompt bias,"The University of Georgia sent out acceptance letters for the class of 2020 and is facing questions about its application from a major civil rights advocacy group.The Lawyers Committee for Civil Rights Under Law has requested information from the University of Georgia and 16 other southern universities regarding the criminal history questions on their applications.“Our research showed nearly 100 million Americans have a criminal record, and people need to understand that having a criminal record doesn’t mean you’re guilty,” said Brenda Shum, director of the Educational Opportunities Project.


 


According to 2014 Bureau of Justice Statistics, of an estimated 744,600 inmates in county and city jails, 35 percent were black and 15 percent were Hispanic.Shum and her colleagues believe the questions do little other than make a barrier for minority students. The organization would like to see the questions removed from all college applications.Many students, however, still believe a university has a right and duty to know this information, arguing that it is key to the safety and security of campus life. “It matters what you got arrested for, but you have to make sure you have a safe campus, so I understand it,” said Marlon Hardiman, a senior risk management major from Acworth.Some institutions may reject applicants out of hand or require many additional steps for these applicants to gain entry, Shum said.Many schools request records of arrests, and not simply convictions, meaning that they could potentially reject candidates who were innocent.The University of Georgia’s application asks if an applicant has ever been charged with, convicted of, or pled guilty or nolo contendere to a crime other than a minor traffic offense.“Any time there is an additional process that an applicant might be required to go through, there is a risk of an unreasonable barrier to higher education,” Shum said.


 


For many, one mistake could cost them a lot more than they ever thought it would, and some may wind up paying for no reason at all.“While litigation remains an option, we’re hoping that administrators and students will join us in trying to take a closer look at their own admissions practices,” Shum said.Shum said there is promising evidence that students are interested in this issue, but for many, it simply is not something often thought about.“It’s not something I’ve ever thought about,"" said Sierra Runnels, a sophomore international affairs major from Baton Rouge, Louisiana. ""It didn’t occur to me how that would be discriminatory when I applied, but I could see how it could be.""When asked for comment, Jan Gleason, executive director for marketing & communications, issued the following statement:""As part of a holistic approach to screening candidates for undergraduate admission, the University of Georgia includes disciplinary and criminal background related questions on its undergraduate application to protect the safety of our community. When a student responds yes to the criminal background question, the Admissions Office contacts the applicant to request additional information, including a detailed description of the charges and any court/legal documents.  Once additional information is provided, the admission decision-making process resumes.""",Harrison Young @redandblack,uganews,https://www.redandblack.com/uganews/civil-rights-group-suggests-criminal-history-questions-on-uga-applications/article_43acf026-eb30-11e5-a6fb-576e8a9fdf2f.html
17-Mar-16,Georgia women's swimming starts NCAAs strong,"The Georgia women’s swimming team won the only event at day one of the NCAA championships.The 800-yard freestyle relay of Hali Flickinger, Kylie Stewart, Meaghan Raab and Brittany MacLean broke the Georgia school record set in 2013 and the pool record set by Texas A&M earlier in the day. MacLean stopped the clock at 6:51.80, nearly a whole second faster than the 2013 Georgia relay and an astonishing seven seconds faster than the Texas A&M relay.“That really sets the tempo for the week,” Georgia head coach Jack Bauerle said. “Winning is important, but swimming well is equally important. All four ladies swam their fastest time ever and it took every bit of that to win. It looks like that’s how the meet will go.”


 


The victory earned the Bulldogs 40 points and the lead after day one. Trailing them is the University of Southern California with 34 points and California with 32.The Georgia swimmers also kept an impressive record going with a win in the relay. At least one male or female Bulldog has won an individual or relay event every year at the NCAA championships meet since 1995.The NCAA championships will continue tomorrow with five swimming events and one diving event.","John Durham

18-Mar-16,Meet the SGA candidates: Dare platform,"Dare ticket members said they want to challenge members of SGA to cultivate personal relationships with other students.“We are daring ourselves as student leaders to really step up and actually be advocates for students,” Tifara Brown, the Terry college senator running for president said.Brown said building student relationships is the crucial first step to facilitating change. She described her platform as a grassroots campaign, in that ordinary people maintain the principle role in the organization.


 


Hamilton Way, running for treasurer, embodies the ordinary students this in Dare’s campaign.Way is not a current member of SGA, his sole experience in SGA was through Freshman Forum three years ago. However, Way is involved in various campus organizations like UGA HEROs, The Chapel Bell and Dawg Camp.Way said he believes his affiliation with different groups on campus, coupled with his distance from the inner workings of SGA, provide the ticket with a crucial outside perspective.“I feel like I give a great voice of how the average person feels. I can determine what students wish we would do that we’re not, and what we should do to make up for that,” Way said.Gaby Reyes, a multicultural organizations senator running for vice president, said her motivation for taking on this role is uniting the Hispanic population with SGA.Reyes noticed a huge gap between the two groups and seeks to close it. She has already helped organize the first collaborative meeting between SGA and the Hispanic Student Association, which resulted in more involvement by Hispanics in the student government.If elected, Reyes said she hopes to continue working towards unifying many groups on campus.“This isn’t a campus for Greeks, this isn’t a campus for blacks, whites, Hispanics, Asians — this is a campus for all of us. We can’t promote that unless everyone has a voice at the table,” Reyes said.


 


Brown said she endorses this climate of inclusivity as well.Brown said she learned about the importance of promoting inclusivity on campus through the #ITooamUGA campaign, started to highlight micro-aggressions minority students face.SGA partnered with I Too Am UGA founder Vernessa Clemmons to interview students for about an hour about their experiences as minority students. A video was constructed from these clips.From this, Brown discovered the power in hearing other’s stories.“I know what it is to have your voice silenced. If in office, I want to be able to collaborate with our other students to break that barrier,” Brown said.To break this barrier, Brown found it necessary to highlight the diversity problem at UGA.Brown did acknowledge the national awards UGA has received for diversity and commended the administration for making an effort to promote it. Brown said she found the diversity problem is caused by the students and not necessarily the system.“Our issue is that we have diverse groups of people operating around each other. If the minority population [rose up to] 50 percent tomorrow, we would still be operating in our own comfortable bubbles,” Brown said. “We want to take those different bubbles and bring them together.”

If ed, the Dare campaign plans to implement several initiatives to bring UGA’s large campus together.The ticket plans on conducting informal and themed “town halls” monthly to provide students with an organized setting where they can pose questions and concerns, Reyes said. Reyes and Brown said when they tabled in the past, the main thing students desired was a space to talk with members of SGA.“It’s not that students don’t have ideas or concerns, were just missing that space where we can have these types of conversations,” Brown said. “All of the issues we want to solve come from these conversations.”In addition, if ed Dare will implement a division of Student Affairs program called Unite, Brown said. The goal of Unite is to bring together two different organizations that wouldn’t normally intersect so that they can discuss issues, network and simply hang out, she said.Despite the new goals the Dare ticket hopes to accomplish, the campaign does not reflect an ""out with the old, in with the new"" mentality, Brown said.“Ultimately we want to lay the foundation for the expansion and betterment of programs we have on campus,” Brown said.",Hannah Echols @echols_hannah,uganews,https://www.redandblack.com/uganews/meet-the-sga-candidates-dare-platform/article_8b40b83a-ed03-11e5-8e63-f73711788c2f.html

20-Mar-16,5 Beauty Hacks for the struggling college student,"Sometimes the college student struggle is too real. You want to do what’s best for your skin and hair, but your finances just aren’t having it. With the money you already have to shell out for classes, clubs and simple necessities, there’s just not a whole lot of money left over to dedicate to making sure you look your best. Here are five beauty hacks to help you get through those times when your dollar doesn’t match up with your intentions.1. Use shampoo as shaving creamYou’ve probably encountered that one situation where you really needed to shave but are out of shaving cream. Luckily, anything that can make a good lather can work just a well and help you hold out until your next shopping trip. While many turn to soap in this situation, shampoo can work better as it’s less harsh and can create a thicker lather that is easier to shave with.


 


2. Buy multi-purpose oils.Oils are an underrated gift that can help seal in hair moisture and keep your skin feeling soft. In order to get the most bang for your buck, consider buying pure oils that can be used for cooking as well as skin and hair care.Coconut oil, olive oil, avocado oil and grapeseed oil are easy to find in the cooking section of most grocery stores, and they provide hair with strength and shine. Extra virgin oil is the most effective, and you can put the amount of oil you plan to dedicate to your hair and skin in little jars or plastic spray bottles.3. Use sugar to exfoliate.Exfoliating your face is an excellent way to fight breakouts and keep your pores from being clogged. Unfortunately, conventional exfoliating products can be expensive, and some are not eco-friendly because they contain tiny pieces of plastic known as microbeads.Fortunately, you can make your own exfoliator by taking white sugar and adding olive oil until it forms a paste-like consistency. Just make sure to wash it all off afterward to keep your face from being sticky!4. Use a t-shirt instead of a towel to dry your hair.Using a towel after washing your hair can make it frizzy. By plopping your hair in a cotton t-shirt, you can get the extra water out and keep your strands intact.


 


5. Cover your hair in coconut oil before dying it to minimize damage.When it comes to dying your hair, it’s usually best to leave it the professionals. Sometimes, though, you might not have the money to pay for a pro job, or maybe you want to take a more DIY approach just to try it.You can minimize the damage of a self-dye job by coating your hair in coconut oil the night before and washing it out right before dying your hair. The result should be softer hair that is better able to withstand bleach.",Danny McArthur @Danny_CMcArthur,culture,https://www.redandblack.com/culture/beauty-hacks-for-the-struggling-college-student/article_9382f7d6-eed1-11e5-8142-0380a23a9f6a.html
20-Mar-16,Cine Critique: '45 Years' subtly heartbreaking,"Marriage has historically been a focal point for cinema, as it provides endless opportunity for filmmakers to explore complex relationships and character dynamics. For a film that seemingly doesn’t have a lot going on, Andrew Haigh’s “45 Years” delivers an intricately written and acted study into the inner workings of marriage.“45 Years” centers around Geoff and Kate Mercer (Tom Courtenay and Charlotte Rampling) as they prepare to celebrate their 45th wedding anniversary. One week before the big day, Geoff receives news regarding the girlfriend he had before he met Kate. She had died tragically when they were young, and he learned that her body had just been found in a glacier in Switzerland.Through the course of the movie, Geoff struggles with unresolved feelings about this woman, and Kate has to suffer with the thought that her husband never truly loved her throughout their 45 years of marriage.


 


This film opens with a beautifully bleak wide shot of an English landscape as Kate is out walking her dog Max. The audience becomes accustomed to this style of cinematography from lead cinematographer Lol Crawley, as it establishes itself to be a visual representation of the bleak nature revealed in Geoff and Kate’s marriage once the news of Geoff’s former lover starts to cause doubts about the 45 years they had spent together.The usage, or lack thereof, of camera movement further visually represents the state of the Mercers’ marriage. The exposition of “45 Years” is filled with lots of stagnant long takes with very few close-ups. This lack of close-ups during scenes of dialogue prevents the audience from accessing the intimacy of the marriage at first, giving the appearance of a perfectly happy husband and wife from a distance. But once the close-ups and shot-reverse-shots appear in the second act, the audience begins to see the shaky foundation this union is based upon.Charlotte Rampling is nothing short of sensational as Kate, and Tom Courtenay delivers an effective onscreen partner in Geoff. Rampling was arguably the least talked-about of this year’s lead actress nominees at the Oscars, but her performance was beyond worthy of the nomination. She shows the audience a woman who has come to the realization that her husband never really stopped loving the woman before her, even through all 45 years of their marriage.The costuming by designer Suzie Harman further adds to Kate’s progression as a character. In the exposition, she is dressed in colors that are dark and saturated. As the story progresses and her marriage starts to slip away from her, Kate’s wardrobe starts to become as bleak as the landscape around her. This allows the audience to physically see Kate lose her sense of self into the surroundings, as she has tied so much of her life into her marriage and has to grapple with the realization that she was her husband’s second choice.While “45 Years” doesn’t have a traditionally dramatic plot line or much of a definitive climax, it takes audiences through an incredible journey into the inner workings of the relationship between a husband and wife. This film takes audiences behind the veil of intimacy within the institution of marriage and shows how easily this institution can be brought to its knees, even after standing strong for 45 years.",Cam Gaskins @cam_gaskins,culture,https://www.redandblack.com/culture/cine-critique-years-subtly-heartbreaking/article_b831782c-eeaa-11e5-acd6-f7d0ee888fa8.html
20-Mar-16,Her Story: Senior who devotes life to sexual assault prevention moves toward law school,"Madison Turner said the most defining moment of her life happened in August 2015 when more people than ever attended the Walk a Mile in Her Shoes event she founded on the University of Georgia campus in 2014 through the Relationship and Sexual Violence Prevention group.“I was leading the walk with some of my best friends,” Turner said. “We were at the very bottom of the hill, and I turn back, and there were still people walking down over the Million Dollar Staircase, because that’s how many people were in line to walk.”Turner, one of the founding members of RSVP and president of the group in 2014, said through the organization, she brought the Walk a Mile program to UGA to spread awareness about sexual assault on college campuses and encourage the men on campus to walk a single mile in women’s shoes.


 


Turner said all the people walking with her was a touching moment.“I just got ... tears in my eyes, got chills,” she said. “It was just the craziest ... moment for me because I realized ... I did that.”As one of the founding members of RSVP, Turner said she worked hard to start the group and sees her contributions as her legacy.  “Once I realized [rape and sexual assault] happened, I wanted everyone to be educated,” she said. “I hope that [Walk a Mile in Her Shoes] will continue to be an annual event because I brought that to UGA as a way to really raise awareness and engage the community in the situation.”Beyond her work at RSVP, Turner has been involved in student organizations across campus.She has served as a Student Government Association senator and as a committee lead for UGA Miracle’s Family Relations Committee, among other positions.Turner, a senior double majoring in criminal justice and political science only weeks away from graduation, said she has received acceptance offers from law schools across the South.Even though she is headed to law school in the fall, Turner said she pledges not to forget her roots in the RSVP program.


 


“Until we live in a country, and live in a world, where women are not assaulted sexually ... I’m going to keep working toward that,” Turner said. “I have a feeling it will be a life-long initiative.”Turner is a proud feminist and said her definition of feminism boils down to empowering women and promoting equality.“At the end of the day, if we have the same opportunities as men in careers, in our lives ... everything else is going to fall away,” Turner said.While at UGA, Turner said she has experienced blatant sexism in the classroom.Turner, who is a member of Alpha Omicron Pi, said a professor during her freshmen year said the day or day after bid day, she was wearing her sorority tank-top and a professor joked that she was only in the class to study boys.“I was in an honors class,” she said. “Just because ... I was wearing the clothes that were stereotypically what sorority girls wear, I felt like he was making so many assumptions about me that weren’t true.""“I’m a double major, and I’m going to law school in the fall,” Turner said. “I’m definitely not here to study boys.”Turner said this wasn’t the only time she faced criticism for her gender.

Turner said a professor had told her she would be better off marrying a lawyer rather than studying to be one, so she could have the money without the work.Turner said she believes UGA can overcome the stereotyping of women, particularly those involved in greek life. “If you had a world where women were respected as much as men ... that couldn’t be the same world where women were sexually objectified because those are the things keeping us from living in a world like that right now,” she said.",Anna Logan @annaklogan,uganews,https://www.redandblack.com/uganews/her-story-senior-who-devotes-life-to-sexual-assault-prevention/article_4e957c52-ee45-11e5-a36e-c75c981425c0.html
20-Mar-16,Georgia track and field closes Georgia Relays with strong showing,"The Bulldogs start their outdoor season with 18 total victories this weekend at the Georgia Relays held at the Spec Towns track. After a five-win performance on Friday, the team gained 13 more on day two of the meet.“I don’t think it was totally unexpected to see these performances,” head coach Petros Kyprianou said.Junior Asianna Covington kept the momentum from Friday going after getting second in both the shot put and hammer throw by adding a first-place performance in the discus. Covington won the discus on Saturday after her fifth of six throws traveled 151 feet, 3 inches. 


 


Freshman Hayden Merrick highlighted her first showing for the Bulldogs by adding her name to the UGA records. Merrick had a throw of 148-7 on her sixth and final attempt to place second, a mark good enough for 10th in school history. Freshman Denzel Comenentia, who won the shot put the day before, earned another victory in the discus. Comenentia threw a 174-9 while teammate senior Ashinia Miller threw a 167-8 for second.Georgia Stefanidi opened her outdoor season by winning the pole vault, clearing a height of 12-5.50. Staefandi’s sister Ekaterini Stefanidi also pole vaulted this weekend but at the World indoor Championships in Portland, Oregon. She placed third with a height of 15-9.During the 3000-meter run, senior Brooke Koblitz earned top honors with a time of 9:58.56, while Kate Northrop's 10:11.87 and Kingsley Green's 10:17.01 got the Lady Bulldogs a 1-2-3 finish in the event.As for the men’s 3000, senior Sid Vaughn won the race after completing his laps in 8:29.45. Freshman Daniel Navarro ran 8:43.65 to gain second.Senior Ashley Henry started her last meet with the Bulldogs by winning the 400 meter dash with a time of 55.04. Second place went to sophomore Devon Artis, who ran a 55.75.Sophomore Derrick White completed the Georgia sweep in the open 400 meter after finishing the men’s race in 48.03.Georgia also took control of the 100 meter dash with a win by sophomore Katie Stone and Jon Okoye. Stone hit a personal best by sprinting a 11.82, while Okoye also ran a personal best with a 10.45.


 


Leontia Kallenou won the high jump (5-8.75) on a first attempt clearance.Ayrian Evans, Raytez Jenkins, Reggie Glover and Maurice Freeman started their outdoor season by grabbing the top collegiate finish in the 4x100m with a time of 40.09.In the final event of the day, the Bulldogs placed in the 4x4 relay on both the men’s and woman’s race. Ashley Henry, Devon Artis, Natalie Bordes and Catelyn Schmiedebusch combined to clock a 3:50.25 to finish first for the women. Derrick White, Jeramey Hampton, Maurice Freeman and Kisean Smith finished one-hundredth of a second behind the winning squad to take second with a 3:12.08.Georgia gets back to work next weekend at the Yellow Jacket Invitational in Atlanta on March 25-26.","Tyree Brown

21-Mar-16,Hansen’s Hits: March 21,"Bad release weeks happen. And sadly, this was a pretty poor week for new music. Bands like Killswitch Engage and 3 Doors Down are both past their respective primes – especially the pitiful attempt by the latter to write a sex club song with the lead single “In The Dark.” Even some of the albums I was anticipating the most this week, namely Flatbush Zombies, still left a lot to be desired. There were still some very strong tracks this week, but I didn’t have nearly the issues I had the last couple of weeks narrowing the pool down to only 10. AURORA – “Conqueror”Unlike most of this week, an album that didn’t disappoint at all was AURORA’s “All My Demons Greeting Me As A Friend.” A mixture of great melodic multi-layered vocals and strong percussive prowess makes “Conqueror” stand out on an album that was the cream of the crop this week.


 


Into It. Over It. – “Open Casket”The beginning and the end of this track may scare a few listeners off with rough feedback guitar effects, but not me. The wonderfully plucked guitar patterns and the depressing lyrical content kept me invested in this quick tale of mortality, death and depression.CFM – “Brain of Clay”CFM attempted to find out how much reverb they could apply to … well, everything and still make a coherent musical album. “Brain of Clay” is an accurate title for a track like this – befuddled and hazy.Flatbush Zombies – “R.I.P.C.D.”Laced with grime, Flatbush Zombies’s debut album “3001: A Laced Odyssey” still has a lot of character as a whole, but as I mentioned in the introduction, it left something key to be desired: better beat production. Luckily, the beat of “R.I.P.C.D.” is just as unsettling, old school and grimy as the lyrics the three emcees spit.Emmy The Great – “Dance W Me”


 


Emmy The Great’s oddly titled “Dance W Me” has a fantastic low-end mix with booming bass giving the track a lot of character. The build on the chorus is also divine, even if the way the track name is just casually mentioned – like a studio outtake – at the end of the chorus.Brian Fallon – “Nobody Wins”Sporting a bit of a country influence, Brian Fallon’s “Nobody Wins” has a rumble to it no other track this week has. The chorus trucks along with Fallon’s vocals driving the song forward.  Rita Wilson – “Crying, Crying”Another pseudo-country track, but Rita Wilson’s carries a lot of bouncy energy to it. The syncopated drum fills and strings help add scope and dynamics to the track, especially the piano riffs trailing off into the distance at the end of each chorus. Bent Shapes – “Realization Hits”Bent Shapes dropped an overall consistent album with “Wolves of Want,” and the standout track “Realization Hits” is an above-average rocker. The guitars have a solid bite to them and the vocals flow well and remain easy and pop friendly.


TNCMS.AdManager.render({region: 'fixed-big-ad-bottom-asset', slot: 1, fold: ""below""});


Obsidian Kingdom – “A Year With No Summer”This off-kilter track by Obsidian Kingdom starts very uneasy and ominous with a plodding bass line before exploding into a wall of noise. Sludgy guitar riffs flood the mix and the vocals sink into the background adding another complex layer to the mix.Beau – “Oceans”Emotional, beautiful and passionate: all of these characteristics describe Beau and her track “Oceans.” The vocals remain at the forefront with all of the light guitar rhythms and breezy synths backing her delivery well.",Zach Hansen @zach_ehansen,culture,https://www.redandblack.com/culture/hansen-s-hits-march/article_a6151752-ef9f-11e5-b893-8fe83cf7ed70.html
21-Mar-16,Two men arrested for human trafficking in Athens Days Inn,"On Saturday, March 19, Athens-Clarke County police entered a room at the Days Inn on North Finley Street in reference to a possible missing 16-year-old from New York.According to a police report, the responding officer was advised that the occupants of the room may be armed, and therefore waited until other officers arrived. The officer reported the smell of marijuana coming from the room.When police entered the room, they found a member of the “snow gang” and arrested him upon contact. Police found the 16-year-old girl inside the hotel room with a large black purse, and when police entered the bathroom, they found another man on the toilet. The man told police that he had a gun on him with matching permit, which was later confiscated, according to the report.


 


The two men, both 22 years old from Covington and Sandy Springs, and the young girl were transported to the East side police station. The two men were charged with armed robbery with a gun, pimping a person under 18 years of age and trafficking commercial sex acts, according to the report.Police found the hotel room was registered under a separate name from New York, and were told that other suspects were headed to Florida, according to Sergeant Jeff Clark of the Centralized Criminal Investigations Division of the Athens-Clarke County Police Department.With assistance from Florida law enforcement, police were able to rescue another juvenile victim and five possible suspects who were arrested and are in the process of being extradited to Athens, according to Clark.","Charlotte Norsworthy

22-Mar-16,"MAC Cosmetics' new campaign makes large, multi-faceted argument about inclusivity","MAC Cosmetics, widely accepted by makeup-wearers as the powerhouse of lipsticks, announced its latest partnership: “Fearless and compassionate, Caitlyn Jenner opens up about the transformative power of beauty and her M·A·C partnership in support of transgender communities.” She will have her own shade of lipstick––appropriately named “Finally Free” to represent the freedom Jenner experiences of being finally free from living a life incompatible with her identity, and finally free to be herself. It is set to release April 7 exclusively on maccosmetics.com . . . so let’s all get excited. I haven’t even seen it (but only because a picture is not available yet), and I know I want it; I love this campaign and everything it represents.Before the exciting Jenner partnership announcement, MAC was immersed in a whirlwind of controversy over a picture posted on Instagram. The picture simply a Black person wearing MAC lipstick, but (unfortunately, not too surprisingly) the comment section quickly became brutal and saturated with racist comments. Shortly after, in an effort to smooth things over and separate itself from the racism, MAC posted a graphic, true to the MAC aesthetic makeup lovers live for, stating that it is for “All Ages, All Races, All Sexes” with this caption: “M·A·C stands for and respects All Ages, All Races, All Sexes. We celebrate the beauty of individuality, and the confidence to be who you are.”Within the makeup-loving community, the company is known for having colors that match more skin tones than competition, which is a great thing. I appreciate the message that makeup can be for whoever wants to wear it; that’s a message society needs to hear and believe.


 


Anyone can wear makeup, but that does not mean that anyone has to wear makeup. Wearing makeup is a choice, and people should have the freedom to choose whether they want to wear it or not. No one should ever judge anyone for wearing––or not wearing––makeup.Many individuals think people wear makeup to impress others. More specifically, people think women wear makeup to impress men. While that may be the case sometimes, it is certainly not necessarily true all the time. For example, in case it isn’t too obvious, I like makeup. It is really fun; it’s all the fun of getting to paint without my problem of lacking the ability to paint well. I am also comfortable having no-makeup days, though.People who wear makeup do not necessarily wear it to impress anyone, and it is absurd to assume they do. Women do not live their lives for men. To assert that women wear makeup to impress men is giving the patriarchy more power than it deserves––and it has enough power without anyone giving it more.Partnering with Caitlyn Jenner is a good move for MAC. she is, of course, and transgender person, which reinforces the belief that makeup––particularly MAC makeup––is for everyone. More than that, though, she is a cultural icon, so she will have the exposure necessary to make this campaign bigger than makeup enthusiasts and social justice aficionados.- Katie Davis is a senior from North Carolina majoring in philosophy and sociologyOpinions expressed in The Red & Black are the opinions of the writers and not necessarily those of The Red & Black Publishing Co., Inc.

22-Mar-16,The rebirth of politically conscious hip-hop,"If you look back at the rap scene of the mid 80's and 90's, you might see a political theme. Hip-hop pioneering groups such as Public Enemy, N.W.A. and Grandmaster Flash transcended music and began to address social and political subjects inspired by their stories in the ghettos. Artists such as, Tupac, The Notorious B.I.G. and Nas made music that uplifted and educated young minorities from the projects and slums of America. What sets these pioneers apart was their courage. They disregarded the fear of backlash that may come from their efforts to shed some real light on the situation of poverty and violence that they experience in their everyday life.However, somewhere around the turn of the new millennia, politically and socially-conscious hip-hop was pushed underground and was replaced by crunk and party-themed lyrics.However, in recent years, hip-hop returned to its roots of politics, and conscious rap began to pick slowly up steam. Conscious rap is about message delivery through storytelling influenced by great political voices such as Gil Scott-Heron, The Last Poets and Marvin Gaye; such in the case of ""The Message"" one of the first conscious rap songs released in 1982 by Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five. Spirited by Kendrick Lamar and his Grammy-winning album ""To Pimp a Butterfly"" whose character runs the spectrum from slam poetry to upbeat club classic, this consciousness is widely apparent in his music.


 


So, what is the cause of the sudden rise in politically conscious hip-hop?Over the past couple years, high-profile cases of police brutalities against unarmed black Americans have gained the world's attention. Police brutality, and the disproportionate incarceration of black men seems to be the modern-day successor to chattel slavery.The new system of race operates so tactfully that it does not resemble a system. It is a system that idealizes diversity while being the breeding ground of injustice. It is a system that promises a colorblind utopia while ignoring the reality of race inequality in any significant metric of society in which black Americans fare much worse than their white counterparts.In this, it has also given rise to politically conscious rap to the music of underground artists such as Kendrick Lamar, Killer Mike, MosDef and the dozens if not hundreds of new rap artists who speak on these issues, utilizing their own experiences. When Hip Hop and Politics Intersect Great Convo & Interviews happen. Thank U @cthagod, @djenvy & @angelayee for into'N your audience to @berniesanders. The Hip Hop community is smart & informed and will be a big factor in deciding who out next POTUS is.

However, they do so not to glorify these ideals but to portray them artistically as the reality in which they were raised and warn their audience of the associated dangers of this new system of race.The rise of public awareness through social media is combatting this firmly entrenched system of racial injustice, and the rise of the “new school” of politically conscious hip-hop reflects that reality.

23-Mar-16,US may gain lung disease vaccine through improved relations with Cuba,"Cuba has developed a potential treatment for lung cancer, and a New York company is trying to bring it to the United States.CimaVax is a vaccine based treatment for lung cancer developed by the Center for Molecular Immunology in Havana. With improving relations between the two countries, there is a chance this vaccine could become available in the U.S. thanks to the Roswell Park Cancer institute, a New York based research foundation, which has applied with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to begin trials on this drug in the U.S. that could start as early as this year. 


 


“There’s going to be a big outlay of capital to do the clinical trial, and somebody has to make it available, we’ll have to see what company might pick it up,” said Michael Pierce, director of the University of Georgia Cancer Center. Unfortunately, this process can take an incredibly long time, a hard fact for many struggling with the disease, he said. “It’s sad, anytime there’s any press on a cancer lead, I get calls ""my brother’s dying, is there any way we could get any of this?"" I have to say it isn’t possible,” Pierce said.The treatment works by training the body’s immune system to target a protein called epidermal growth factor. EGF is essential in the growth of lung cancer, and CimaVax limits the cancer from spreading.But, Kimberly Klonowski, an immunologist and associate professor in the Department of Cellular Biology, said the vaccine would not be a magic bullet against the disease.  “We’ve had anti-EGF antibodies for decades in the U.S. and we haven’t heard much about them, and I’d assume that’s because they don’t work that well,” Klonowski said.",Harrison Young @redandblack,athensnews,https://www.redandblack.com/athensnews/us-may-gain-lung-disease-vaccine-through-improved-relations-with/article_af4cb982-f0ef-11e5-91dd-1fcc7f2232b1.html

Once the user clicks on their ideal route, a map of the route appears along with walking directions to the nearest bus stop for that given route.


 


Stephanie Sharp, IT senior manager at the University of Georgia and a member LEAD Athens, pursued this project as a personal project until the group decided to adopt her project last summer. However, Sharp said she still worked with the smaller details acting as the head of technology for the project.Sharp said she saw a need in the community after she visited New Orleans and saw their buses were linked to Google Maps.“I assumed that Google had a way to go out and get this information from a transit system,” she said.Sharp said when she got back to Athens, she noticed the bus icon was not active on Google Maps. She said her combined experience working in technology as well as her love for public service was the force for this addition.""That’s when I discovered that someone has to do this — someone has to do the work.”The official UGA app features information on Athens Transit bus routes and schedules; however, Sharp said the app isn’t user-friendly for the most part.“If you know the bus system, it can be useful,” she said. “But if you’re new to Athens or you’re traveling through Athens, you don’t know how many bus routes there are or where they stop.”Sharp said the connection to Google is already making the lives of Athenians easier since its release.


 


“The Bike Athens group is really excited about it because you can get from one place to another when they’re only traveling by bike,” she said. “They don’t have to know anything about the bus system.”Butch McDuffie, director of Athens Transit, said he is excited to have another tool for members of the community to use.""Our world is changing in how people receive data,” he said. “Now, they can just Google it ... which is something that we have not had in the past.”McDuffie said he is hopeful that the addition will promote the use of public transportation.“I think it will help a lot of people who choose to use public transportation,” he said. “So hopefully this will help our ridership looking at the big picture.”Sharp said if this project were not completed by a group of volunteers, it would have cost the community close to $40,000.“It’s free and open to use as long as you have the technical expertise within your transit authority to create this system to work with Google Maps,"" she said.Other members of the project included Steven Dasher of the Athens Regional Foundation, Tricia Davis, director of health information management at St. Mary’s Healthcare System, Richie Knight with HW Creative Marketing and Curt Spell, a real estate agent with Blanton Properties. These team members worked with Sharp on some of the technical details, focusing mainly on marketing and public relations for the Athens Transit to Google Maps link.

The project was officially completed and went live last month, and now that it has been revealed to the public, the team will begin advertising it on the Athens-Clarke County government’s cable TV channel as well as on all Athens Transit buses.Sharp said this is only phase one of three as she works to make the program even better.“When you look at the route on a map, it goes across lawns or through buildings, and that is because Google doesn’t know the specific street turns that the buses take to get from one spot to the other,"" she said. “Phase two consists of me drawing shape files that Google will recognize that tells it which street turns are required to get from one stop to the other.”Phase three consists of incorporating real-time bus locations, according to Sharp.“It will actually tell you where your bus is in relation to where you’re standing to see how quick it will get there,” she said. “Right now, there are just time estimates, but the tracker will more accurately predict when it will arrive.”Steven Dasher took part in the research portion of the project in which he looked to other cities who have implemented the bus icon on Google Maps.“We looked at cities such as the Chatham Area Transit Authority down in Savannah to see how they implemented this and how they continued to keep it rolling sound,” he said. “Our project is established and now we can reap the benefits of having Athens Transit on Google Maps — that’s exciting.""",Charlotte Norsworthy @cfnorsworthy,athensnews,https://www.redandblack.com/athensnews/athens-transit-now-on-google-maps/article_957af1d4-f0ec-11e5-ab97-cf1e63657e0d.html
24-Mar-16,Georgia pitcher Robert Tyler shows no regression after forearm injury,"In five innings, Robert Tyler’s return to the Georgia mound on Opening Day against Georgia Southern left 13 red Ks on the porch of the green house in right field, one for every strikeout the junior pitcher recorded.“Robert’s one of those phenoms that doesn’t come around very often,” junior catcher Skyler Weber said.But in his next five starts, Tyler never made it past the sixth inning. Head coach Scott Stricklin monitored his pitch count, targeting Tyler’s exit around 75 pitches.


 


Stricklin waited until the first games of Southeastern Conference play this past weekend to let the hard-throwing right-hander loose ­­­— well, to the tune of a 90-pitch limit.One February earlier, Tyler left his outing against Georgia Southern with discomfort in his right forearm.  This was new; he had no past dealings with any arm issues.“I was [anticipating] the worst,” Tyler said. “We didn’t know what was going on, especially driving back to Athens to get the MRI. I had a lot of thoughts going on in my head.”Tyler pegged the initial results as good news: no surgery. Next came the research, as he looked across the major leagues and found forearm strains to be a regular symptom experienced by pitchers on the disabled list.Tyler also found his new arm distress was due in part to the baseball implemented in college in 2015. The seams were lowered closer to the ball, allowing it to carry further in hopes of generating more offense. The new model resembled a baseball more similar to the one used in the major leagues.As a result, pitchers like Tyler were forced to grip the ball tighter, putting more strain on the forearm. So he started over.

He had to regain confidence in each of his pitches. He was on a strict pitch count in May 2015 with 50- and 70-pitch outings for Georgia, earning no decisions in each. Stricklin cited “the mental hurdle” as the biggest barrier for Tyler.“The biggest thing was trying to convince myself that I wasn’t hurt anymore,” Tyler said. “My body felt good, but my [mind] was telling me I wasn’t. I just had to tell myself I was fine.”His doubts were alleviated over the summer with his performance for the U.S. National Team. He boasted a 3-0 record over nine innings with a 1.00 ERA. Before his national stint, he pitched briefly for the Bourne Braves in the Cape Cod League to keep his arm in shape.            Stricklin spent the early part of the 2016 season curbing his pitchers’ usage. He pegged SEC games, which began with the Kentucky series that started March 18, as unrestricted outings for Tyler and other Georgia starters.  “I think [the pitch count’s] a good thing, because I can just go for it,” Tyler said. “I know whenever I get to that limit, I’m done. I can just bust my butt until I get to it.”But the pitch count hasn’t been Tyler’s most glaring foe of late. In his start against Kentucky, he gave up seven walks, which he called “unacceptable.” He still got the win, only giving up two runs in the 5-2 victory.“I know this is going to sound crazy,” Tyler said in his thick south Georgia accent, as he prefaced his philosophy of escaping from pressure-filled situations.Tyler said the burden he puts himself in — like the added stress of seven walks — challenges him, making him a better pitcher on the mound.


TNCMS.AdManager.render({region: 'fixed-big-ad-bottom-asset', slot: 1, fold: ""below""});


He wants to be able to handle the situation himself. Unless his catcher, freshman Michael Curry, decides to add his own input between innings.“We have a good connection,” Curry said. “So I’ll go crack a joke and get him smiling.”Five starts in, Tyler stands sixth in the NCAA in strikeouts per nine innings, and his total number of strikeouts is at 39. There have been moments, dominant ones, for the potential top draft pick who pitches in front of stands packed with radar guns and Major League Baseball scouts.With his pitch count closely regulated, there’s a sense Tyler’s best stuff in college hasn’t been seen — it could be in the proverbial seventh or eighth inning of his career. As he enters the thick of SEC play, Tyler raises a familar question in the age of forearm strains and limited pitch counts:What could Tyler do with nine innings on the mound?","Jackie Kinney

25-Mar-16,Georgia drops opening game in Mississippi State series,"Everything was going well through three innings for Georgia baseball in its game against Mississippi State on Thursday. Until it wasn’t.The No. 10 Mississippi State Bulldogs (16-6-1) used a seven-run fourth inning to build an insurmountable lead and defeat Georgia (14-9) 9-2. The loss is Georgia’s fourth straight.Freshman Kevin Smith has been one of Georgia’s best starters this year but lasted just 3.2 innings against the Bulldogs. The rally started off a solo home run from Reid Humphrey -- who hit two on the day -- to put Mississippi State ahead 2-1. The team never looked back.


 


“The big inning was a killer, and Kevin was one pitch away from getting out of it,” Georgia head coach Scott Stricklin said. “I told the team that it was disappointing that we got beat in one inning.”Freshman Addison Albright pitched a career-high 4.1 innings in relief for Georgia. Keegan McGovern saw his hit streak come to a close after going 0-for-3.Georgia stays in Starkville for the second game of its series with the Bulldogs Friday at 7:30. Robert Tyler will take the mound.“We’ve got our ace going Friday in Robert Tyler, and we’re looking forward to a good start from him,” Stricklin said.","Evan Greenberg

25-Mar-16,Love Your Melon spreads to campus community,"In fall 2015, seniors Peyton Bennett and Ali McClure launched Love Your Melon at the University of Georgia. The proceeds from this apparel company directly benefit children battling cancer and fund initiatives to find a cure.“Love Your Melon is a one-for-one philanthropic clothing brand that sells hats, beanies and shirts,” said McClure, secretary of Campus Crew, the name for UGA’s chapter of Love Your Melon. “When you buy a hat, not only are you buying one for yourself, but you are also buying a second one for a kid with cancer.”Love Your Melon was conceived in an entrepreneurship class at the University of St. Thomas in St. Paul, Minnesota. Over time it became a nationwide, American-made apparel brand fueled by the work of college students. 


 


Approximately 15,000 children are diagnosed with cancer every year. However, Love Your Melon hopes to eliminate this figure entirely with the help of partnership organizations.  Fifty percent of Love Your Melon’s profits go directly toward research and support for children battling cancer.  The first 25 percent of profits are donated directly to CureSearch for Children’s Cancer, a national nonprofit organization that works toward finding the cure for childhood cancer. The additional 25 percent goes to the Pinky Swear Foundation, which pays for gas, hospital bills and the expenses that pile up for families whose children are battling an illness.  When buying a hat on Love Your Melon’s website, patrons can directly credit it to UGA’s team. Then students from the university will personally deliver an additional hat to a child staying at a local hospital.  Love your Melon has already donated 52,000 hats to children with cancer across the United States. “Our primary goal is raising awareness and promoting the brand,” said Petron Bennett, UGA Campus Crew captain and president. “Eventually we want to go into hospitals in Atlanta and local ones in Athens and pass out hats to the kids.”Campus Crews remain relatively small to promote quality over quantity and create a genuine culture within the organization.  These small numbers also facilitate hospital visits. Students members at UGA also frequently receive challenges from their regional manager. Recently, they were asked to find a celebrity local to Athens to promote the brand on social media.  “One of the things that makes us unique is that we’re really not an organization limited to college campuses,” McClure said. “Celebrities are involved and people all over the place, not just college students.”Bennett and McClure reached out to the family of Aaron Murray. Working in conjunction with Josh and Aaron Murray, they were able to reach UGA’s athletic community and Josh Murray’s “Bachelor” fan club.   


 


UGA is currently third in sales in the Southeast region and has nearly reached its goal of 500 hat sales for the year.  After they reach their goal of 500 sales, UGA’s team can more directly work with families whose children are battling cancer. The team plans to eventually spend time with children outside of the hospital and form bonds with their families.“I want to be a pediatric oncologist,” said Bennett. “This is what I want to do forever.  I know children need medical treatment, but they also need treatment as an individual.”UGA’s team is capped at 20 members; however, that doesn’t mean others can’t participate.  Students can work alongside the organization and promote awareness and directly benefit childhood cancer funds, especially through the use of social media.  Spots to join the UGA Campus Crew will open up at the end of the semester when members of the current team graduate.",Michael Banks @mgbanksy,culture,https://www.redandblack.com/culture/love-your-melon-spreads-to-campus-community/article_39b4b2ac-f1fc-11e5-8873-6320a67aa74d.html
26-Mar-16,Georgia baseball falls to Mississippi State for team's 5th consecutive loss,"For the second day in a row for Georgia baseball the difference between winning and losing was one inning. The Bulldogs (14-10, 1-4) had a 1-0 lead against Mississippi State (17-6, 4-1) going into the seventh inning. But a State rally put it up 3-1 and the team didn't look back.Georgia starter Robert Tyler was dealt a no decision despite pitching six scoreless and hitless innings. Logan Moody got the loss, giving up three runs with one of them earned. 


 


“We gave them too many opportunities to cash in during the seventh and eighth innings; it was a tough loss,” Georgia head coach Scott Stricklin said. “We had a 1-0 lead in front of a big crowd on the road against a good team, and we let it slip away.""Game three of the series in Starkville, Mississippi, will be Sunday at 3:04 p.m.","Evan Greenberg

26-Mar-16,Georgia dominates hammer throw to begin Yellow Jacket Invitational,"Georgia athletes took home a 1-2 victory in the hammer throw on both the men’s and women’s track and field team. This is a consecutive top-two finish for both teams since they had the same result in last week’s outdoor season opener.“I was pleased with the overall performances, which were very close to last week’s performances,” Georgia throwing coach Don Babbitt said.This week, the Bulldogs traveled to Georgia Tech in Atlanta to compete in the Yellow Jacket Invitational on Friday.


 


For the women’s team, senior Shelby Ashe and junior Asianna Covington went 1-2 in the women’s hammer throw for the second consecutive week.Ashe threw a mark of 200 feet, 11 inches on her fifth attempt to win the event. Teammate Covington repeated last week’s performance by earning second with a throw of 191 feet, 11 inches.As for the men, junior Alex Poursanidis was able to best last week’s winner and teammate, freshman Denzel Comenentia, by throwing a season-best mark of 225 feet, 9 inches for the win.  Comenentia, who won last week’s season opener, managed second place with a sixth and final toss of 220 feet, 7 inches.“We just completed a heavy week of training so to be able to maintain our competitive standard while being this fatigued is a good sign,” Babbitt said.",Tyree Brown @brotha_tyree,sports,https://www.redandblack.com/sports/georgia-dominates-hammer-throw-to-begin-yellow-jacket-invitational/article_219c69b0-f36b-11e5-9174-8b90d63ee11d.html
27-Mar-16,Young Democrats of UGA president found in violation of 3 out of 4 policies,"On March 25, the University Judiciary, after about two hours of deliberation, found Emma Krass in violation of the University of Georgia Code of Conduct policies 3.6, 3.7 and 8.2.  These policies state Krass, president of the Young Democrats of UGA, failed to comply with law enforcement, participated in a campus demonstration that violated UGA’s freedom of expression policy and used a campus building without authorization.Krass was also charged with policy 3.1, obstruction of university activities, but was not found in violation.


 


The sanctions Krass faces are to follow university codes in the future, attend a follow-up meeting scheduled for May 1 and turn in a two-paged paper on the university’s freedom of expression policy, to be turned in May 1.  The judiciary hearing was scheduled after Krass was arrested on charges of criminal trespass during a sit-in at New College on North Campus Feb. 1, which she refused to leave when UGA Police arrived to remove the protesters from the building.   The demonstration was held by members of Freedom University — an Atlanta-based institution focused on teaching undocumented students in Georgia — to call President Jere Morehead and the presidents of Georgia State University and the Georgia Institute of Technology to publicly denounce the University System of Georgia’s Board of Regents policies 4.1.6 and 4.3.4, which ban undocumented students from attending public institutions in Georgia and from receiving in-state tuition, respectively.    During the demonstration, several undocumented students were arrested alongside Krass, who faces a separate hearing for her criminal charges, as the university judiciary is distinct from state law enforcement and only decides if a student violates university codes.   Krass’s arraignment will be April 12.For about about six hours, starting at 8:30 a.m., a series of witnesses testified for and against Krass and several documents were reviewed, leading to the judiciary’s decision.Throughout the hearing, Krass maintained she had not violated the university’s policies.In fact, several of the testimonies made for Krass said the actions she took should be celebrated.


 


“UGA should be proud of the actions Emma Krass and others took,” said Adam Veale, who was found not in violation of a similar conduct code violation after he was arrested at the Georgia State Capitol protesting for Medicaid reform.Veale said Krass’ active participation in the protest at New College “upheld the pillars of the Arch.”   “What she did was what any UGA student should strive to do,” Veale said. “This integrated classroom was designed to further education for people who are currently being denied that opportunity.”Krass said she “knew she could not stand idly by” but that it was her civic duty to protest the injustice the undocumented student protesters faced and stay in the building alongside them as police made arrests.None of Krass’ witnesses said they felt the protest would have been as effective if Krass and the other students had not remained in the classroom.And each of Krass’ witnesses said if the University Judiciary found Krass’ conduct in violation of the code of conduct, it might discourage other students from speaking out for causes they believe in.  Lt. Jeff Whitfield, a UGA police officer who was present when the arrests were made, said the only reason the arrests were made was because the students did not have permission to stay inside New College after closing, he said. The arrests were made after 9:30 p.m.“We protect free speech, but we consider time, place and manner,” Whitfield said.

The UGA Freedom of Expression policy designates two free speech zones on campus where students can protest without notifying the university beforehand. These are located at Tate Plaza and Memorial Hall Plaza.If a student wishes to engage in spontaneous protest anywhere else on campus, they must obtain permission from the university and alert university police.The group of protesters on Feb. 1 did not fulfill this requirement.",Lindsey Conway @LindseyVConway,athensnews,https://www.redandblack.com/athensnews/young-democrats-of-uga-president-found-in-violation-of-out/article_f91290c6-f3d0-11e5-b803-d3f803e33367.html
29-Mar-16,SGA Executive Ticket Topic: All In campaign discusses importance of campus involvement,"This is the second Q&A in a series with the Student Government Association Executive ticket candidates.Student Government Association executive ticket All In hopes to connect with all different groups on campus through their combined involvement in volunteer, leadership, Greek and athletic organizations.The Red & Black sat down with the All In ticket to discuss how their involvement has shaped their campaign and will continue to shape their role in SGA, if elected Wednesday.  


 


Red & Black: What organizations are you all involved in on campus?Megan Corriveau, candidate for treasurer: I’m involved in the Gamma Phi Beta sorority, I did UGA HEROs for two years, I was the co-coach for the ‘Girls on the Run’ nonprofit organization [the Northeast branch], I have been the director of student resources in SGA for the past year and I’m on the event planning committee for the Relationship and Sexual Violence Peer Educators student group.Sam Street, candidate for vice president: I got involved with SGA my freshman year and applied to be part of the freshman programs. I was in Freshman Focus, which is now [Freshman] Connect. I ran for senate my sophomore year and got a seat as a Franklin college senator. I served on the athletics committee and the allocations committee for a while as well. I’ve also been on the club swim team since my freshman year. I am currently treasurer, but won’t have an executive position on the team next year because I’m running for SGA exec. In addition, I rushed Sigma Nu in 2013 and was the involvement chair for two years.Shallum Atkinson, candidate for president: I was the former chief justice for SGA for two terms. I had to resign to run for this position, in order to remove any conflicts of interest. I also serve as the president of the Black Male Leadership Society, which was last year’s organization of the year. I have been involved with the Black Affairs Council as well as Road Dawgs this year. It was the first annual year of Road Dawgs, a program where we travelled to inner city high schools with the goal of reaching minority groups. This helps UGA’s recruitment process to increase diversity on campus.R&B: In the SGA Student Body Elections debate last Wednesday, Shallum said “We can’t be exclusive in our inclusivity.” How will your presence in these organizations help you to include more organizations in SGA, if elected?SA: I think that SGA as a whole gives you a certain reach to parts of campus that you may not have solely being a part of other organizations. It is an organization that is committed to the entire student body. Some organizations I’m in are targeted to specific groups, like the Black Male Leadership society. This gives me a unique perspective when I’m trying to recruit new members, get our points across or accomplish the goals we have put into place. Connecting SGA with the smaller things I do allow those things to reach a higher level, such as how BMS was the organization of the year. This was due to our ability to organize events on campus and our efforts to include other students in our work.MC: I definitely think our involvement makes us very approachable. Students can find a connection with us through many different avenues. Our names are out there, and we’re meeting people and then they are meeting other people — it’s this snowball effect. It has been awesome because students have reached out to us to say why they support us. This has linked us to their area of campus and their individual experience with UGA. We obviously don’t cover all of campus. There are 800 plus organizations. We would love to get to know even more of them. But already having this footing on campus will let the student body see that we are relatable, approachable and fun to be around.SS: I think I bring a different perspective as well to this ticket. We are all three very well rounded students here at Georgia. We fit into different outlets that the school offers. For me, being on the club swim team and Sigma Nu allows me to meet such a hodge podge of different people that are involved in so many areas on campus. I’ve developed very personal relationships with those people as a leader in those organizations. It has really helped me get to know more about what kind of students are here at Georgia that we normally don’t see.


 


R&B: So, you want to represent student voices in the groups you are a part of. But, has your ticket discussed plans to also represent students outside of these organizations involved?MC: I think that’s what we are trying to say. Yes, we are a part of these different organizations but that allows us to reach out to all organizations as a whole. And not just organizations. I don’t care if you’re involved in an organization or not. If you are a student at UGA, it’s our job to care about you.R&B: How have the connections you all have made through these organizations helped to make your campaign easier?SA: It has given our campaign a larger base of people to reach out to. Because people have actually seen our work in play through our leadership positions, people have more of an attachment before they even look at our platform and initiatives. I went from the top down in talking to administrators on a regular basis and did things like having lunch with President [Jere] Morehead. I’ve been a UGA intramural referee on campus since freshman year. Having people just see my face to laugh and joke around with me is instrumental. Our ticket does a lot of things on campus that impact a lot of people, but at the end of the day we are just regular students.R&B: How does your heavy involvement at UGA coincide with why you chose to name your campaign All In?MC: We were brainstorming and tossing verbs around, and we knew we didn’t want to choose anything limiting. We wanted something that seemed to encompass what we set out to do, and what we set out to do was to be relatable to better every student’s experience. We were talking and saying that we’re all in to do this, and all in to do that ... from there we decided alright, we’re All In.SS: When we were meeting last semester we started going over our platform points before we even came up with the name. We agreed that our platform would be a gateway to coming up with the name. We found that we wanted inclusivity to be such a big part of our campaign. That sparked All In for us, and it was something we immediately agreed upon.SA: It’s even down to our tagline. My favorite movie is Drumline. There’s a part where they say, “One band. One sound.” When you’re listening to a band, it’s not about the trumpets and the drums or the instruments that drown everything out. The softer wind instruments and the flutes are just as important to making the overall sound. Each and every one of us, coming from all walks of life, make up what people mean when they say ""the University of Georgia,"" not select groups, not a specific few, not the same people who consider themselves at the top of the bureaucratic system of UGA. We’re all one group, one family. One body. One voice. One UGA.

31-Mar-16,Beam of hope: Gymdogs make improvements in weakest event,"At the beginning of the season, a few of Georgia’s beam rotations featured just as many routines with falls as ones without major mistakes. The four-inch wide piece of equipment had turned into a haunting source of errors that could have been detrimental if it were to follow the Gymdogs into the postseason.But in the final portion of the regular season and at the SEC championship, Georgia had four consecutive meets where it surpassed the 49.0 team total benchmark on the event, meaning the team had an average score of 9.8.Before that streak started on March 4, the Gymdogs had only reached a mark this high twice all year. Meanwhile on the other three events, anything lower than a 49.0 is an abnormality.


 


“Looking back on it, everything takes time,” senior Mary Beth Box said. “Beam just happens to be the event where it shows that it's taken us time to develop.”At NCAA regionals, the Gymdogs must finish at least second in the six-team competition in order to advance to the national championship. Georgia’s test on beam will arrive early.While teams in regular season dual meets always start on either vault or bars, having six teams in one competition forces the meet to have all four events running at the same time, along with two byes.Since Georgia is the No. 2 seed at its regional, the team will begin on beam.“To be able to start there and start nice and strong and put that one in our back pocket and then we move on I think is a great rotation for us,” head coach Danna Durante said.In eight of the Gymdogs’ 13 meets so far this year, beam has been their lowest event total. But most of those occurred in the first half of the season.“A lot of people will probably say, 'Oh, it's all about beam and it's about hit or miss for them. It's good that they start because it will be a good determining factor of how the rest of the meet will go,'” senior Brittany Rogers said. “I think that's a way for us to start off strong.”


 


Photo by Taylor CarpenterBased on Georgia’s event totals this year, beam is the only event that is a statistically significant predictor of the overall team total. This means the Gymdogs’ total varies closely with their beam score. Therefore, if Georgia does well on beam, it typically has a high overall score and vice versa.But Georgia views these mistakes as something that will not linger into the postseason.“I don't see it being a struggle for us right now,” Rogers said. “We're not crawling into our shells thinking, 'Oh we're heading to beam.' It's more of like, 'Oh yay, now we can shine on beam.'”And lately, that’s what they’ve done.In the last four meets, Georgia’s beam lineup has notched six scores of at least 9.9 and a handful of others above 9.8.


TNCMS.AdManager.render({region: 'fixed-big-ad-bottom-asset', slot: 1, fold: ""below""});


In their preparation, the Gymdogs have been simulating the NCAA regional by beginning practice intrasquads on beam and using a similar format of warming up that they’ll experience on Saturday.An overarching theme for the lineup lately has been for the gymnasts to simply perform the same routine that they typically show in practice.“That's really all we need to do in order to prove that we're a great beam team is to do our average because all of the girls in the lineup are superb beam workers,” sophomore Natalie Vaculik said.After reaching a low of No. 43 in the national rankings on beam, Georgia climbed to No. 18 on the event prior to the NCAA regional. On the other three events, Georgia stands in the top 10.Still, in February when Georgia was ranked No. 43 on beam, it was able to defeat No. 1 Florida.Georgia is coming off its first weekend without a competition since the beginning of the semester, and Box said she’s noticed a strong sense of confidence during practice.“Once we hit beam, which I have a feeling we are going to, the mentality is to keep fighting and keep bringing the energy,” Box said.","Emily Giambalvo

1-Apr-16,Gymdogs hope to qualify to NCAA championship at regionals,"The Gymdogs have officially entered the crunch time of their season, and that means postseason has begun. Georgia will host five other schools for the NCAA regional on Saturday.In order to advance to the national championship, Georgia must finish at least second.In the Athens regional the schools joining No. 9 Georgia include No. 3 LSU, No. 13 Oregon State, No. 22 Arizona, No. 27 George Washington and No. 36 Michigan State. Of those opponents, Georgia has only faced LSU before this season, and the team has seen LSU twice.


 


Regionals being hosted in Athens means the trio of seniors didn’t have to say goodbye to Stegeman quite yet when they competed at Senior Night in March. Now they have another opportunity to compete with a home crowd.“The fact that I get almost another senior night is making it a lot easier to accept that I’ve been here for four seasons and I’ve had my time,” senior Brittany Rogers said. “We’re kicking butt in the gym right now. So I know we’re going to end it off strong.” Regionals are different than regular meets. The team members have to stay in a corral while their teammates compete, and warm ups are adjusted to allow individual competitors from other schools a chance to prepare.Only four teams can compete at a time, which means all the teams will have two byes in their schedule. The gymnasts must adjust to be able to handle the longer meet since regular season competitions do not have this stop-and-go nature.“It’s kind of a challenge for me to have byes because I do over-focus during that time,” Rogers said. “Danna makes it to where she wants us to play games and take our mind off competing because if you focus on it way too long it's just too hard to maintain.” In order to adjust to these changes for regionals the coaching staff has been adding components like this to the team’s practices to get them ready for this Saturday’s meet. This gets the team mentally prepared as well as allows their bodies to know what they need to in order to be ready to compete.“We’ve thrown some things in the middle of practice where they have to turn their minds to a different focus, and then had them come back and show routines,” head coach Danna Durante said.This team has had a strong last two weeks in the gym preparing for regionals, according to Durante. After competing every weekend since the beginning of January and having one of the toughest schedules in the country, the gymnasts were finally able to have a break last weekend.


 


It’s tough on both the body and the mind to go that many weeks without rest and to have to maintain focus the whole time. Finally having a week off from competing and traveling is key to the success in the gym as Georgia prepares for regionals.“We’ve had the chance to get some really good work done and not travel mid-way though the week,” sophomore Gigi Marino said. “We also get some really good rest in because we’ve finally had the time.” The Gymdogs said they have prepared and are ready for anyone.The seniors know it’s their last time competing in Stegeman, but hope they get to wear that Georgia leotard three more times, meaning they would have made it to Super Six team final at the national championship.“If everyone could see how we’re doing in the gym right now we would definitely be in the talk of national championship and Super Six because we are kicking butt right now and we are super confident,” Rogers said. We’re super excited to get back into Stegeman one last time.”","Brittany Stocus

1-Apr-16,A look at the Gymdogs' competition in the NCAA regional,"At the NCAA regional on Saturday, the top two teams will advance to the national championship. Georgia enters the meet as the second-ranked seed among a field of six teams.The competition will be held in Stegeman Coliseum as Athens is one of the six locations for regionals this year. Below is a breakdown of the six teams in the competition and their chances of finishing in the top two.No. 3 LSU


 


The third-ranked Tigers come into the regional as the top seed and are therefore clearly a favorite to move on to the NCAA championship.LSU’s top four team totals of the regular season are all higher than any earned by the other five schools that will compete in Athens.However, when LSU met Georgia in a dual meet this season, the Gymdogs won. In the SEC championship, LSU outscored Georgia. Coming to Athens, LSU associate head coach Jay Clark will be making a trip to his alma mater and the school he spent 20 season with, including three as head coach.LSU junior Ashleigh Gnat arrives in Stegeman off three consecutive perfect 10s on floor. Earlier in the season, she also scored a 10 twice on vault and another time on floor. She tops the national rankings in those two events and competes the hardest vault in college gymnastics. Of her vault and floor performances in 2016, Gnat has only dipped below a 9.9 once (and even that was a 9.875). LSU has a crew of well-known freshmen, including junior elite national champion Lexie Priessman, 2012 U.S. Olympic team alternate Sarah Finnegan and McKenna Kelley, who is the daughter of 1984 Olympic champion Mary Lou Retton.LSU has had its share of trouble on beam this year, but both meets came early in the year. Recently, the team has seemed to rectify any problems on the event and has pulled itself to a No. 3 ranking on the event. LSU will end the meet on vault, one of its best events, even though a high final event score probably won’t be needed for the Tigers to earn their way to NCAAs. No. 9 GeorgiaAt the beginning of the year, Georgia struggled to post scores that were in the range as those earned by the nation’s top teams. Lately, however, the Gymdogs have been fairly consistent and enter regionals with four straight meets where they scored above a high-196. Still, these scores are a few tenths away from LSU’s season bests. Although, to qualify to the national championship, Georgia doesn’t need to beat LSU. It just needs to finish second, so if all teams have an average meet with no major downfalls, Georgia and LSU will be heading to NCAAs.Based on average scores, Georgia has had one of its worst seasons in recent years on beam. The beginning of the year featured rotations that had multiple falls, which resulted in the team only being ranked No. 43 in the country on the event at the beginning of February. However, in the last five meets, the Gymdogs have managed to find some consistency on beam. The test comes early as the Gymdogs begin the meet on beam. After that rotation, Georgia will have the floor, vault and floor, which have all been solid this year.

Georgia trio of seniors — Brittany Rogers, Brandie Jay and Mary Beth Box — will lead the way for the team. All three have displayed consistent ability to produce scores in the 9.9s this year. Freshman Sydney Snead has started her college career as a 9.8 machine and constantly produces strong scores on vault, bars and floor, while sophomore Gigi Marino typically earns high scores on vault and floor. Georgia doesn’t need to worry about qualifying to the national championship, especially if it has at least a somewhat stable beam lineup in the first rotation.


 


No. 13 Oregon SateOn paper, this regional looks like it could be one that has the possibility of getting interesting when it comes to a third-ranked seed upsetting one of the top two teams. However, with Georgia competing at home, Oregon State’s chances of climbing into those spots is not as likely. The Beavers haven’t reached a 197 team score this year, but have been consistent nonetheless. Oregon State just earned a 196.925 at the Pac-12 championship, which was higher than Georgia’s 196.85 at the SEC championship. Still, Georgia competing with a home crowd will put the Beavers in a situation where they will count on mistakes from either Georgia or LSU if they want to go the NCAAs as a team.Madeline Gardiner has significantly helped the Beavers this year with her all around performances, particularly the handful of 9.9s she has earned on beam. Kaytianna McMillian stands seventh in the nation on bars and has scored three 9.95s this year. Oregon State ranks 10th on both bars and beam, and both of those events will come in the second half of the meet for the team. Even with a third-place standing at the halfway point, Oregon State could have the ability to crawl into second late in the competition. No. 22 ArizonaArizona entered the season with first-year head coach Tabitha Yim and expectations of possibly breaking into the group of 12 teams that qualifies to the national championship. However, the team has spent most of the season in the 196s and hasn’t emerged as a real contender to upset LSU, Georgia or Oregon State. The team’s best event is beam where it is tied for No. 14 in the country. Arizona will start the meet on floor after having a bye in the first rotation.

No. 27 George WashingtonGeorge Washington shocked most of the NCAA gymnastics world when it ranked seventh in the country after its first week of competition. However, the 196.175 it scored in its season opener turned out to be its second-highest score of the year, with a 196.6 coming at the end of February. Still, in the last few years the team has made vast improvements. George Washington has only dipped below a 195 once this year and will have a chance to show its consistency again at regionals.


TNCMS.AdManager.render({region: 'fixed-big-ad-bottom-asset', slot: 1, fold: ""below""});


No. 36 Michigan StateMichigan State barely made its way into the field for regionals, as only the nation’s top 36 teams qualify. The Spartans have only broken into the 196s once this year and are coming off a sixth-place finish at the Big 12 championship. However, Michigan State’s floor totals this year suggest that the team’s might near the Athens regional’s top schools on that event. On beam, Michigan State hasn’t had strong totals compared to its regional opponents as it has been floating in the high 47s and low 48s.Final VerdictLSU and Georgia should easily be the two teams that qualify to the national championship, barring no major mistakes from those teams. Georgia competing at home will give the Gymdogs a chance to increase their margin over Oregon State, but if errors arise on beam, the Beavers could quickly have an opportunity to find their way into the top two.","Emily Giambalvo

2-Apr-16,Sydney Snead misses NCAA regional due to sore back,"In Georgia’s NCAA regional competition, freshman Sydney Snead did not compete on any of the three events she has performed throughout the year.Head coach Danna Durante said a sore back prevented her from competing. In her final season of club gymnastics, Snead sat out due to back problems.Still, Georgia was able to earn a second-place finish with a 196.85 and therefore qualify to the national championship.


 


An hour prior to the meet, Georgia’s staff decided that senior Brittany Rogers would take Snead’s place on floor.“Of course, I was ready to go and I was very thankful for the opportunity to do floor,” Rogers said. “I know Syd wishes she was out there and I performed for her. I wanted to make her proud.”Snead was originally slated to still be in the lineup on vault and bars since those would have less of an impact on the injury.However, Durante said after Snead ran down the vault runway in warm up and didn’t feel good to go, the coaches opted to have junior Lauren Johnson compete in Snead’s place on vault and bars.“She was a little disappointed and you could see it very clearly,” senior Brandie Jay said. “I was going to say something to her after we marched in, and then I look over and she's fine. She got her emotions in check and she was just there for her team.”Both Johnson and Rogers have previously competed those events earlier in the season.“We were excited that experience Lauren Johnson had gotten on vault and bars throughout the year and obviously Brittany on floor because they were able to step in and do a really good job,” Durante said.Johnson earned a 9.825 and 9.775 on vault and bars, respectively, while Rogers received a 9.8 on floor.


 


On both vault and bars, Johnson occupied the anchor position. Durante said this decision was made to keep a similar lineup structure as other meets and to closely resemble what Johnson is accustomed to when she performs as an exhibition in practice intrasquads.The final spot in the lineup can also take some of the pressure off a gymnast, given the previous five already had successful performances.Snead has competed vault, bars and floor at all 13 meets earlier in the year. She has consistently earned scores of 9.8 or higher on all three events, with season-highs of 9.9 on vault and bars.“She was disappointed, but at the same time she's like, 'I know I'll be ready for nationals,’” Durante said.",Emily Giambalvo @EmilyGiam,sports,https://www.redandblack.com/sports/sydney-snead-misses-ncaa-regional-due-to-sore-back/article_419928ac-f938-11e5-8ed3-ab1eba5dae39.html
2-Apr-16,"Gymdogs advance to national championship, seniors close Stegeman careers","Just as Brandie Jay finished her routine on bars, she was overcome with emotion and immediately embraced her coaches standing nearby.The stuck dismount that led to a career-high 9.95 signified not only her final routine of the day but also her last performance in Stegeman Coliseum.“Usually I keep my emotions in check pretty well and I'm pretty emotionally stable for the team,” Jay said. “I lost it for a little bit and I was excited. I was glad to go out of Stegeman like that.”


 


At the NCAA regional, Georgia’s three seniors competed their final meet in Athens, but they’ll perform again this season at the NCAA championship thanks to Georgia’s 196.85 and second-place finish.The No. 9 Gymdogs qualified to the national championship and finished behind No. 3 LSU, which tallied a 197.3 at the regional. The competition’s final results stayed true to the teams’ national rankings as No. 13 Oregon State, No. 22 Arizona, No. 27 George Washington and No. 36 Michigan State finished third through sixth, respectively.Of the 20 routines that sum together to create a team’s score, seniors Brittany Rogers, Mary Beth Box and Jay combined to produce 10 of those.Rogers’ strong showing in Stegeman came as a second chance Senior Night after she had a couple mistakes in March at the regular season home finale.“[On Senior Night, Rogers] was disappointed that she didn't perform the way that she wanted or the way she normally does,” head coach Danna Durante said. “For her to be able to finish strong and Mary Beth and Brandie also have phenomenal nights again, as a class it's nice to be able to finish that way here.”In addition to Jay’s career-high on bars, she also tallied a 9.9 on floor and a 9.85 on vault. Rogers accounted for another one of Georgia's 9.9s with her vault, and Box finished her Stegeman career with scores of at least 9.85 on beam and floor, the two events she competes.Jay’s all-around score was the meet’s second highest total, followed by Rogers, who placed third.Since only the top two teams advanced to NCAAs, this meet always holds the possibility of becoming season-ending. However, Georgia started with a strong beam rotation and was comfortably ahead of Oregon State throughout the competition.


 


“I know a lot of people will say it's new life if you're not top two,” Durante said. “We had a lot of those questions over the last two weeks, especially given the up-and-down season that we've had. For us, it was like, 'This is another meet. It's just another one.'”Ashlyn Broussard led the Gymdogs with her 9.9 on beam. After Natalie Vaculik’s fall in the second spot in the lineup, the team managed to stay on the beam on the next four routines to avoid counting a fall toward their team score.“We were very confident, but it's always relief when you get over with beam whether you've been struggling with it or not,” Jay said.Even though the Gymdogs surpassed the 49 benchmark on beam that denotes an average score of 9.8, beam was still their lowest event total.Georgia’s best event of the day was floor where both Jay and sophomore Gigi Marino earned 9.9s. Box and junior Morgan Reynolds had the next-highest scores in the rotation with their 9.85s.This year, Athens was one of the six locations to host an NCAA regional, meaning the Gymdogs were able to compete in front of a home crowd even in the postseason.“It's a huge advantage,” Box said. “Our crowd is so loud. Some of us were like, 'Wow, I think they might be louder now than maybe a regular season meet.'”The LSU Tigers finished their meet on floor and vault, where they are ranked No. 2 and No. 1 in the nation, respectively. On the two events alone, LSU tallied seven scores of at least 9.9, including a meet-high 9.975 from Sydney Ewing on vault.

Broussard started the vault rotation with a 9.875 on her stuck Yurchenko full that has a maximum score of 9.95. On vault, bars and floor all of Georgia’s scores that counted were higher than a 9.8.After a season that began with numerous rough performances on beam, the Gymdogs have now consistently produced solid scores on the event. And at the NCAA regional, it was enough to extend their postseason run.“We should all get resilience tattooed on somewhere because I think that's exactly what we are,” Rogers said.","Emily Giambalvo

4-Apr-16,Election update: Republican and Democratic candidates continue to fight for nomination,"For the first week since the middle of January, no presidential debates or voting took place last week, the week of March 28.This recess provided voters with a break from the debates and primary coverage that have dominated the news since August. However, there was no rest this week for anyone still vying for a presidential nomination.


 


Candidates have continued their work on the campaign trail this week, despite the lag in political discourse, and news has continued to surface about each one of the presidential hopefuls. From alleged affairs to abortion debates, each of the candidates had his or her their own battle last week. Below is a summary of what your favorite, or least favorite, presidential candidate has been up to.The DemocratsHillary ClintonWith a 691 delegate lead as of April 4 over her opponent Sen. Bernie Sanders, Hillary Clinton has set her sights on New York, a state which will hold primaries on April 19 and which has 291 Democratic delegates up for grabs.“You’ve always had my back, and I’ve always tried to have yours.” https://t.co/PoSYbXVyeO pic.twitter.com/miQFIXahOY— Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) April 2, 2016A Quinnipiac University poll released Thursday morning predicts that Clinton is polling at 54% in the state; however, the former Secretary of State has already begun heavy campaigning in the state despite her predicted lead.Clinton will invest more time than initially planned in the state in order to remind voters of her political history as the state’s first female senator and a promoter of “New York values.”


 


Bernie SandersWhile Hillary Clinton is expected to retain a lead in New York, Sen. Sanders is quick to remind voters that unlike Clinton, for him New York is home. The senator, who was born in Brooklyn, boldly challenged his opponent to a debate in New York, a move that many speculate was an attempt to establish dominance in the state as he remains behind Clinton with 1,051 delegates.In an interview with CNN, Hillary Clinton’s political strategist Joel Benenson responded to the debate proposal with an official statement from the Clinton campaign.""Senator Sanders doesn't get to decide when we debate, particularly when he's running a negative campaign against us,"" said Benenson. ""Let's see if he goes back to the kind of tone he said he was going to set early on. If he does that, then we'll talk about debates.""“You should be willing to debate anytime, anywhere.” — @HillaryClinton in 2008.https://t.co/UruLT1afY3— Bernie Sanders (@BernieSanders) March 29, 2016Sanders' campaign and his supporters have criticized Clinton for this statement and continue to pressure her to take participate in a debate by implying that failure to do so would be hypocritical.The Republicans

Ted CruzWhile the democratic candidates are preparing to battle it out in the New York primaries, Ted Cruz has been busy dealing with rumors of infidelity that his campaign calls “disgraceful.”A tabloid article by the National Enquirer surfaced in the mainstream news on Tuesday night accusing Cruz of having multiple affairs with an unnamed Texas woman.Earlier in the day, a social media director for Trump also suggested online that Cruz had had an affair with his former communications director and now CNN commentator, Amanda Carpenter. Carpenter denounced the claims as “sexist smears.” Cruz later responded to the accusations on social media, referring to all claims of an affair as ""garbage.""Cruz maintains a second place position in the Republican race, with 466 delegates compared to Trump’s 739.

However, despite this overall lead, this week national attention has been directed to a demographic that Donald Trump is not “winning” — women.Reports surfaced earlier in the week that Trump had insulted Heidi Cruz by threatening to “spill the beans” on her via social media, which he later admitted ""was a mistake."" Shortly after this news story broke, Trump’s campaign manager was arrested for “manhandling” a female reporter.Polls now indicate that only 24 percent of women planning to vote in the republican primaries support Trump, the smallest amount for any republican candidate. Trump also gained criticism from both the pro-life and pro-choice movement when he said that women should be ""punished"" for having abortions, a statement that he has since declared a misstatement.Trump was also criticized by the republican party after, in an interview with Anderson Cooper, he abandoned pledge to stand by the whoever will be the republican nominee. Trump met with republican leaders on Thursday for what he called, “a unity meeting” and a chance to clear the air.Stay tuned for more updates to come from the Red and Black’s Election 2016 coverage.","Grace Walker

5-Apr-16,UGA students showcase different cultures for the Comparative Literature Jamboree,"With more than 100 students bustling about in the courtyard of Joe Brown Hall playing Japanese Yo-Yo fishing, trying on Swahili clothes and tasting Kimchi Bokkeumbap, the Department of Comparative Literature held its third annual Jamboree on March 30.The occasion was akin to a fair, only it provided free food, entertainment and cultural exchange. Students and teachers in the department’s Chinese, Korean, Japanese, Swahili, Vietnamese and Yoruba language programs came together to showcase their individual cultures through dances, songs, debates and display boards.“As you see, many people are not ethnically from those places, but they have found some kind of connection with that culture, so they’re learning the language,” said Soudabeh Rafieisakhaei, a graduate teaching assistant. She said the event aimed to celebrate the multicultural nature of the department. Fatai Olorunsola, senior microbiology major, modeled a traditional Dashiki at the Yoruba table.“I’ve taken Yoruba all four years, but the jamboree and the cultural awareness celebration are the only two times when I’m able to see other cultures within the Comparative Literature building and how different we are, which is really important to us,” he said.Students formed a long line in front of the Vietnamese table to try its food.The Swahili table doled out homemade mandazi, samosa and pilau. Zarina Wafula, a graduate teaching assistant, said she wanted people to know more about Swahili, as it was one of the most popular languages in the world.“The food introduces students to part of the culture of the Swahili people. We do that in our classes too, so that we taste the food, and learn about its people and culture,” she said.The Korean program had students bouncing on a seesaw, dressed in its traditional Hanbok and tasting Kimchi. Ashley Kwon, freshman biology major, said the event gave students an idea of what Korea was.“Kimchi represents Korea, and so does Hanbok, so they show people what we’re made of,” she said. Cody Kim, a sophomore biology major, said showing students Kimchi and Hanbok was good because food and dress were an integral part of any culture. “The jamboree is great because it gives us more representation. It’s good to be more tolerant of and have more knowledge about other cultures,” he said.Chuan-haur Liu, graduate teaching assistant, alternated between writing Chinese calligraphy on red scrolls on demand and competing in chopstick competitions with students.“Chopsticks are the tools we use for eating and calligraphy is a very traditional and influential art of writing, so they are most representative of the things we do in China and Taiwan, which is why we would like to do it here,” he said.Rahul Katkar, a sophomore biochemistry and linguistics double major, said he volunteered at the table simply because he liked calligraphy.“I’d like to learn more about the history of each character and the culture behind all of it. For instance, the word “mother is a combination of horse and woman. The logic is obviously different in the East, and that’s something I’d like to see taught,” he said.The Japanese table was strewn with traditional toys like kendamas and tops.Rebecca Sexton, a graduate teaching assistant, said the jamboree was educational for every student.“For students who have already been taking the language, this gives them an opportunity to learn about the culture. If they don’t speak it or know it, this event will expose them to it,” she said.

8-Apr-16,Bubble soccer tournament wraps up Phi Delta Theta’s Masters week,"Thursday night’s bubble soccer tournament concluded the Georgia Alpha chapter of Phi Delta Theta’s Masters Week, a week dedicated to raising donations for the ALS Association.The competition was split into two brackets: a sorority bracket and a general bracket, and two games were played at once throughout the event.“Bubble soccer is such a unique idea, and it appeals to so many people and so many different groups around campus,” said Ben Gladstone, a member of Phi Delta Theta and a sophomore landscape architecture major from Kennesaw. “I thought it was a great way to end the week of philanthropy event."" 


 


A team representing Delta Gamma at the University of Georgia won the sorority tournament, earning $100 to donate to their chapter’s philanthropy, Service For Sight.Madison Miramonti, a DG freshman animal science major from Woodstock, said she had never played bubble soccer before.“It was my first time, and it was harder than I thought,” Miramonti said. “I like soccer, it was fun bumping into everyone, and it was for a good cause. We weren’t just sitting and eating food; we were actually participating in the event which I think is fun.”Delta Delta Delta's team fell short of victory in the sorority tournament, but Camden Werner, a member of Tri Delta, said the event was awesome.“It was a tough battle, but either way, both great sororities were playing for a good cause,” said Werner, a freshman international affairs and Arabic major from Johns Creek. A team representing UGA’s Arch Society won the general bracket and restaurant gift cards.“It felt good to win, but it was for a good cause, so that is what really felt good,” said Jesse Kerzner, a member of the Arch Society and Phi Delta Theta.Kerzner, a sophomore international affairs major from Raleigh, North Carolina, said the games were rough, but he had a great time.


 


“I think everyone should give bubble soccer a shot,” Kerzner said. “Prepare to get beat up a little bit, but it is worth it.”Bubble Bros, a bubble soccer company out of Atlanta, partnered with Phi Delta Theta to host the tournament.Ryan Jones, co-owner of Bubble Bros, said the company travels to a lot of colleges around the state to host tournaments.Jones said bubble soccer is popular in other countries, but there are not many companies in the United States.“Anything that gives guys the opportunity to bash each other in some sort of fun way is always a good thing,” Jones said. “I’m surprised the girls enjoyed it as much as they did. Usually, it is the guys [that enjoy bubble soccer], but a lot of the girls had a really good time.” Nate Bryant, philanthropy chair for Phi Delta Theta, said he was pleased with the outcome of the bubble soccer tournament.“All around, I thought it was awesome. Everyone was smiling and having a really great time,” said Bryant. “As long as everyone had a great time while raising money for a good cause- that is what mattered to me.” Bryant said he was pleased with the entire week.

“The week was great because it was so diverse, and there were so many different events,” Bryant said. “I definitely think we hit our goal of raising at least $10,000 for the ALS Association.”Bryant said he foresees the fraternity hosting bubble soccer again in the future. “We can only improve. One way is with brotherhood participation. A lot of people were involved, but I think we can do even better,” Bryant said. “Another thing we can do is to reach out more to the non-Greek community. Philanthropy is not Greek or non-Greek. It is just humans teaming up to change people’s lives.”",Marlee Middlebrooks @marlee_mbrooks,uganews,https://www.redandblack.com/uganews/bubble-soccer-tournament-wraps-up-phi-delta-theta-s-masters/article_18f18e78-fdaa-11e5-af79-5fbecd020579.html
8-Apr-16,President of Pakistani Student Association discusses recent bombing in Lahore,"Pakistan’s distance from Athens makes it easy to look at the events in Lahore as a far off occurrence, but the human impact of these events knows no borders. Annam Rizwan, a fourth year risk management and insurance major originally from Karachi, Pakistan, is the president of the Pakistani Student Association at the University of Georgia.“I was honestly shocked when I heard about it, it really hurt me but luckily none of my family was affected by it,” she said. “It doesn’t make sense to me. I cannot comprehend why someone would do that.”A suicide bombing in Lahore, Pakistan left 72 dead and over 320 injured March 27. Rizwan’s uncle and recently-married cousin have both lived in Lahore for several years, but were fortunately unaffected by the recent attack.


 


The bombing took place near a playground in the city’s most popular park, Gulshan-i-Iqbal park. The attack, aimed toward Pakistani Christians, has since been claimed by a local branch of the Taliban named Jamaat-ul-Ahrar. The organization has also voiced its support of ISIS in the past.Despite that the group’s spokesperson Ehsanullah Ehsan’s claims that the attack targeted Christian males, the majority of the victims in the attack were reported to be Muslim women and children. The bombing is the most violent attack in Pakistan since the Pakistani Taliban’s school massacre in December 2014, which killed 132 children.The attack follows close in the wake of the bombings in Brussels. The slew of attacks prompted professors in the School of Public and International Affairs such as Jeffrey Berejikian to offer comments on the state of global terrorism. Berejikian is a Josiah Meigs Distinguished Teaching Professor researching U.S. security policy.Rizwan also said there is a lack of attention given to these bombings compared to similar attacks in western countries.“We had filters for the Paris attacks, but why not for Pakistan? They are not any different. Pakistan is not this warzone where things like this just happen,” she said. “The idea that ‘that happens over there anyways’ makes the logic sound so ridiculous, and people saying that is what really hurts me.”Berejikian said that the goal of the bombings remains the same no matter what country the terrorist groups choose to attack.“Their goals in Pakistan aren’t that different than, on the broad level, say ISIL goals are in Syria, to create a new state, consistent with their view of politics and religion,” he said. “Their view is that if you destabilize Pakistan, which is a mess, politically, if you can do anything to destabilize the Pakistani government, create pushback, this helps their mobilization. It's part of that broader theme of terrorism that we’re seeing in the Middle East right now.”Berejikian believes the situation in Pakistan stems from the stirring of religious extremism in neighboring Afghanistan in the last twenty years. “The seeds of radical Islam” that were planted years ago are taking effect, he said, serving as the roots of a religiously charged anti-establishment movement that is striking out at the secular government in Pakistan.


 


The end goal for these groups is the destabilization of the developing Pakistani state, in hopes that the iteration of Pakistan that emerges at the other end will be one more in line with their views, the professor said.As a born Pakistani citizen and practicing Muslim, Rizwan’s ties to Pakistan are an important part of her life, meaning the bombings have a personal impact.While affected by the human suffering, Rizwan was reminded of her country’s position in the western media’s conscience. Rizwan believes the west has a slanted perception of the reality of life in Pakistan, and thought back to her roots in light of the recent media coverage.“What I want people to think about when they think about my country is how friendly the people are. They will make you feel like they are at home,” she said. “They are people just like people here. Kids go to school, people go to work and women are getting [an] education. If you put our two cultures side by side, we are not as different as people think.”Rizwan said she looks forward to a future where her country can hoist itself up beyond the current state of affairs.“These kinds of extremists are everywhere and they are never going to be satisfied,” she said. “Only the people of Pakistan can change their country in the end. There can’t be this outside force that come in and tells the country what is best. It has to come from within.”","Maxime Tamsett and Pete Prybylski

Sophomore Mady Fagan started the success for Georgia in the high jump. Fagan reached six feet for the first time, clearing 6-1.25 to be the best collegiate finisher of the night and third overall. This moved her up to No. 5 on the school’s all-time top-10 list and into a tie for third on the national performance list.“Mady Fagan was our highlight today by making huge improvements from last outdoor season,” Kyprianou said. “She is eager to make it to the NCAA championships, score and help this team reach its goals.”Freshman Aliyah Johnson, who redshirted outdoors in 2015, made her debut in the triple jump and finished fourth at 41-9.75 thanks to her sixth and final try.In the pole vault, Georgia Stefanidi hit a season-best mark. The junior took advantage of a second attempt, reaching a clearance at 12-9.50 to finish fifth.Freshman Denzel Comenentia and senior Ashinia Miller finished third and fourth in the shot put on their home turf.

11-Apr-16,Isaac Nauta developing into viable tight end option for Georgia,"Georgia tight end Isaac Nauta was one of six fresh faces on the field when spring practice began on March 15. Part of a small group of early enrollees from the 2016 recruiting class, the five-star player is expected to have a high ceiling but has to first master what is expected from a player at the collegiate level.According to fellow tight end Jeb Blazevich, so far, so good.“His routes are getting a lot better,” Blazevich said. “His blocking scheme and footwork are getting a lot better. I feel like he's improving. That’s so encouraging to see.”


 


The junior Blazevich said Nauta adds another dangerous body to the team’s tight ends group, which may very well be the deepest position for the Bulldogs. Along with Blazevich and Nauta are sophomore Jackson Harris, who played in 12 games last season, as well as junior Jordan Davis, who appeared in four contests in 2015.Blazevich said the number of capable tight ends on the team is encouraging, a statement that is odd considering the emergence of someone like Nauta threatens his own playing time. Georgia head coach Kirby Smart did say he wants to run more play sets with multiple tight ends on the field, which means Blazevich could be alongside the new freshman phenom instead of one of the two watching intently from the sidelines.Smart reaffirmed Blazevich’s take on Nauta. The first-year head coach said Nauta showed his inexperience early on, as technique along with catching even the easiest of passes came into question. However, as the spring practices tick down to the end, Smart said the five-star recruit is beginning to show his worth.“Early on, he was struggling to block, dropping his head, not being physical,” Smart said. “And, hey, he's supposed to be in high school. He's gotten tougher and gotten more physical.”Blazevich said Nauta might have had the lost look of a freshman early, but that quickly evaporated.“You wouldn't know he's so young,” Blazevich said. “He fits right in. It's like, 'Dang, man. How long have you been here?'”Blazevich didn’t sound surprised that the top tight end in the country came to Georgia. After all, Blazevich said that was part of the allure that drew him to Athens when he committed to the Bulldogs in April 2013. With a history of turning out talented tight ends such as Randy McMichael, Benjamin Watson, Leonard Pope and Orson Charles, the Bulldogs have created a distinction that going to Georgia as a tight end can help you get to the next level.Although last season saw plenty of questions about the use of tight ends, Nauta may have picked the perfect time to come to Georgia. Offensive coordinator Jim Chaney has consistently integrated the tight ends into his system, much to the delight of Smart. He explained Chaney’s ability to mix the tight ends into the gameplan through receiving and blocking was an intriguing aspect to consider when looking for an offensive coordinator.  


 


For Nauta to become a true part of the offense, however, he has to continue making strides.Blazevich said the players this spring have held the mantra to make the next step, which is especially important for a true freshman. The 6-foot-3, 244-pound Nauta may have shown flashes of his ability this spring, but he’ll have to carry it forward through spring ball, the G-Day scrimmage and the summerIf he keeps up the pace, he very well may be on the field come kickoff against North Carolina“He's growing up, and he needs to,” Smart said. “He's got to be ready to play.”","Jordan D.

11-Apr-16,Gender-neutral bathrooms: Why they matter,"North Carolina passed a law, House Bill 2, requiring individuals to use public restrooms in accordance with the sex indicated on their birth certificate––completely denying the legitimacy of individuals’ gender identities. This bill is inherently discriminatory toward transgender people, and it is unacceptable.I have been concerned by bathrooms perpetuating the idea that people necessarily must choose a gender or sex, and it must be their “biological sex”––according to the law, the sex an individual was born as. This definition creates problems in itself. HB 2, commonly referred to as the “bathroom bill,” has brought the issue to the public eye, and brought more people than social justice activists into the discussion. Moments after this bill came into existence, my Facebook friends shared their opinions and divided themselves into two camps: those who think it is completely repulsive that people should use the same bathrooms; and those who think people are all just people, so it should not matter which bathroom they use.I pitch my tent in that second, more inclusive, camp. I have supported gender-neutral bathrooms for years, and I will continue to support them.


 


I am not alone in my support for gender-neutral bathrooms. Celebrities, such as Bruce Springsteen, have canceled shows in North Carolina in protest of the bill, and out-of-state companies have forbid travel to North Carolina unless it is absolutely necessary.A common argument against more inclusive social policies is that some individuals believe they do not matter as much as economic policies. I have not ever agreed with such an argument because nothing will ever convince me that money matters more than people. However, avoiding travel to North Carolina as a result of the “bathroom bill” will have economic consequences for the state; this is fascinating because it necessitates that the absurd social policy affects the economic standing of North Carolina. Perhaps crises like this will enable individuals concerned more with economics than people that social policies are just as important as, and arguably more important than, economic policies.The “bathroom bill” is most relevant to North Carolina, but it has implications for everyone, in all states. Perhaps this discriminatory bill has the potential to exist in other states, for instance.Offering only divided bathrooms for males and females, and perpetuating the idea that sex and gender are purely biological, obviously leads to problems within trans-communities, but also for intersex people. If someone is not defined as either male or female, where do we expect this individual to use the restroom in public? And why does society even think it is its business to police matters as private as going to the bathroom?Of course, there is the misconception that bathrooms are segregated for safety, but discriminatory laws do not make the bathroom any safer for anyone. If someone wants to harm another person in a public restroom, the harmer clearly is not the type of person to be stopped by a simple law.People also seem to believe that sharing public restrooms with all other people would constitute dirtier public restrooms. However, I have not ever been particularly impressed by the cleanliness of public restrooms in general, so I do not think sharing it with other people would make the situation worse. These individuals, who believe bathrooms would be dirtier if we all shared them, tend to believe males are the ones who make public restrooms dirty. This argument is as sexist as a “boys will be boys” argument; that is to say, men are not necessarily dirtier than women in a bathroom, and such an assertion is unfair to males.Several students and organizations created campaigns at UGA in support of gender-neutral bathrooms on campus, but as you have probably noticed, these campaigns have not been particularly successful: Our campus bathrooms continue to perpetuate the idea that a gender binary exists and should be socially enforced. People should be allowed to use the restroom based on their gender identities.- Katie Davis is a senior from North Carolina majoring in philosophy and sociology

12-Apr-16,Filipino Student Association tells legends of the Philippines at annual culture night,"A crowd of more than 400 people in the Tate Student Center Grand Hall April 9 were transported from a simple room at University of Georgia into the rich culture of the Philippines at the Filipino Student Association’s 11th annual ‘Legends from the Philippines.’The three and a half hour program incorporated a mixture of Filipino culture, including food, dancing, fashion and song.FSA will donate the money raised through ticket proceeds to the Antonio Pichon Jr. Elementary School in Davao City, Philippines. Their goal was $700.


 


In this area, there are more students than desks or supplies. FSA hopes the proceeds will help provide a more conducive and comfortable learning environment for students.FSA President, Charyse Magdangal, said a lot of work went into planning a program with such an array of performances.“We typically plan out almost a year ahead of time and start practicing four to six months ahead. And the past two weeks we have met almost literally every single day,” Magdangal said.Magdangal thanked the executive board for their devotion to the program.“It was a big production for me. I had a dream, and my e-board helped me see it through,” Magdangal said.Several forms of dance were performed during the night. One of the most popular forms was Tinikling, a traditional Philippine dance that incorporates rhythmically beating large bamboo sticks on the ground.These dances, along with the other elements of the program, were strategically placed into a storyline.A variation of two Philippine myths, the story of Dyesebel and the story of the Manananggal, directed the evening’s events.


 


The star of these stories was Sherilyn Queen. Queen said the incorporation of legends into the program was pivotal in creating an authentic cultural experience, right down to the place settings at each table.“Every single table had a place card with a Filipino legend on it. This allowed everyone to learn a little more about the Philippines and the legends,” Queen said.   Although the focus of the program was on traditional culture, there was a significant amount of American pop culture elements incorporated into the show.Members of FSA did hip-hop dances to contemporary rap songs and hosted a trivia game with questions on famous American stars.Magdangal said American pop culture is heavily tied into Filipino culture. She said because the Philippines were colonized by the United States, the country’s culture has a strong American influence.“A lot of us...are first generation Americans. Many of our parents emigrated from the Philippines to provide a better life for us, so we are very Americanized,” Magdangal said.FSA also welcomes several members that are not Filipino in its organization. One of the emcees for the evening, Shubi Iteghie, has been heavily involved in FSA the past year but is not of Filipino descent.Iteghie said he feels at home in FSA. He said the organization has fostered a learning environment for him.

“The thing I like about joining into different cultures is that you get to learn new things. Being an African American, I kind of know my own culture. I didn’t necessarily feel like doing more African American culture events. I wanted to learn more things in order to broaden my mind,” Iteghie said.While FSA expanded Iteghie’s cultural experiences, it allowed freshman Nikki Dionisio to find a sense of comfort on campus.She described FSA as a niche that made her transition to college much easier.“My favorite part about FSA is having a sense of family. A lot of us grew up around the same values and traditions and same mannerisms. Whenever I hang out with them, it’s like I’m at home,” Dionisio said.Magdangal said FSA is a unifying experience for all people that get involved. She advocated the importance of having multicultural organizations at UGA.“It’s important to for us to share our culture because we have a voice. We have a presence on campus. And we really need to show people what our culture is like, because if you don’t speak up then no one is going to know,” Magdangal said.",Hannah Echols @echols_hannah,uganews,https://www.redandblack.com/uganews/filipino-student-association-tells-legends-of-the-philippines-at-annual/article_ece4f75a-0076-11e6-9e86-1f6f1f0917a1.html
12-Apr-16,Company provides Jewish students with free genetic testing,"JScreen, a company that focuses on testing Jewish people for genetic disorders, visited the Rohr Chabad House at the University of Georgia to provide services free for students April 10.JScreen screened the first 50 Jewish UGA students for free. The test normally costs $99 with health insurance and upward of $1,000 without.There are 99 specific genetic diseases tested for, including common diseases like Cystic Fibrosis and Tay Sachs disease.


 


The UGA representative for JScreen, Adam Kramer, is a fourth year biology and psychology major, stressed the importance of screening.“The reason Jewish people are more likely to pass these diseases onto their children is because the Jewish population is so small,” he said. “So, there’s less genes in their pool. If Jews intermarry, the likelihood of us being carriers for similar genetic diseases is higher.”According to the JScreen website, a Jewish child is 25 percent likely to get a disease if both of their parents are carriers. The company detects diseases predominantly in the Ashkenazi, Sephardic and Mizrahi Jewish populations.  The program is stationed out of Emory University but travels to varying universities across the nation to promote genetic awareness and testing. Student interns from each campus, like Kramer, are the ones that facilitate and promote the program to their peers.Karen Grinzaid, senior director of outreach initiatives at JScreen, believes that prevention starts at a young age.“We have this initiatives on college campuses because we want to let people know ahead of time so they can plan ahead,” Grinzaid said.The testing process is as simple as spitting into a tube. The saliva is then sent to a lab where the DNA is extracted. Results are delivered four to five weeks later.JScreen employees and volunteers spend hours constructing and passing out the sample kits.


 


Children who attend the Chabad House helped with the program as well, including the rabbi’s six-year-old daughter, Bluma Refson.“I have to give out all these packages. We delivered over 52 packages in here,” Refson said.Grinzaid emphasized the convenience and availability of JScreen testing.“People can go to JScreen.org to learn about screening and order a kit from home. We don’t just test Jewish people but cover people from all different ethnicities,” Grinzaid said.Grinzaid’s husband, Jimmy, was impressed with how far genetic testing has come.“This can really affect your kids really badly, and all of their life they might struggle. If you know, there are things you can do to ensure that the kid will not have that disease. And that’s incredible,” Jimmy said.The Grinzaid's daughter, Danielle, attends UGA and their son, Ben, is an alumnus of the institution.",Hannah Echols @echols_hannah,uganews,https://www.redandblack.com/uganews/company-provides-jewish-students-with-free-genetic-testing/article_083c8b54-00a3-11e6-91c1-0b74209be50c.html
13-Apr-16,Hillary Clinton email scandal explained: Why is she in trouble?,"While the existence of Hillary Clinton’s private server, and the fact that she deleted everything off of it, seem fairly troubling, that’s doesn’t begin to fully encompass what she’s in trouble for.  The primary issue that FBI investigators are looking at is whether or not Hillary Clinton knowingly retained, transmitted, or deleted classified information from her private server. Communicating this type of information on a relatively insecure private server could put highly classified government secrets at risk by making them be susceptible to hackers and spies.  Mishandling classified information is a federal crime under Section 1924 and Section 793 of Title 18 US Criminal Codes and Procedures. A violation of Section 1924 is a misdemeanor punishable by a fine and up to a year in prison, while a violation of Section 793 is a felony punishable by a fine and up to ten years in prison.  On Jan. 29, three days before the Iowa Caucus, the State Department announced that it had discovered at least 22 emails on Clinton’s private server which it deemed to be “Top Secret” and could not be made available to the public. A few emails have been classified at a level some consider to be above ""Top Secret"", called SAP or Special Access Program. Sources in the State Department have said that at least two of these emails surround the movement of North Korean missiles and the specifics of a drone operation.


 


Hillary Clinton has responded by saying been that she never sent nor received information marked classified while Secretary of State. As the agency head, she would be the ultimate arbiter of what information would and wouldn’t be considered classified. She argues that the emails being withheld by the State Department were not classified information at the time she sent or received them them, but now with new information, they have been retroactively classified. She has repeatedly called this “over-classification run amok.” This stance has been supported by one document being downgraded from “top secret” to “secret” on February 29th.Much of the present day coverage of the email scandal surrounds the ongoing squabble between the State Department and Hillary Clinton over what is and isn’t classified and the classification process. The FBI is now investigating to find out if there is in fact highly classified information on Clinton’s private server, and more importantly, if there is proof that she knew it was classified. This would be a misdemeanor crime under Section 1924, and she could face up to one year in prison.  Many legal analysts have concluded that it will be very difficult for the FBI to find compelling evidence against Hillary Clinton for having broken this law. Given that there are no emails “marked classified” on her server, they would have to prove that she sent, received or deleted information that she admitted to knowing was classified at the time.

13-Apr-16,Solarize Athens awards Nuçi's Space solar panels,"Solarize Athens has worked to raise money to donate and install 36 solar panels at Nuçi’s Space to help reduce energy bill costs. Solarize Athens is ""a community-based solar PV bulk-purchasing program that allows homeowners, businesses and nonprofits in the Athens Metropolitan Area to save on the cost of solar together,"" according to the organization's website.


 


 The organization's campaign is a coalition by Environment Georgia, Georgia Interfaith Power & Light, Georgia Climate Change Coalition and Solar CrowdSource. Solarize Athens also partners with community members, including the Athens-Clarke County Unified Government and Athens Area Branch of the US Green Building Council, according to its website. Nuçi’s Space, a nonprofit organization that works with musicians suffering with depression and other mental illnesses, was chosen as a recipient of Solarize Athen’s solar energy system donation over three other nonprofits that applied for the program. Solarize Athens and Athens mayor Nancy Denson met at Nuçi’s Space today to dedicate the first mini-solar panel. This aligns with Athens-Clarke County’s new energy initiative working ""to be a leader in environmental stewardship while fostering a positive climate for economic development and a vibrant community for personal growth,"" according to an Athens-Clarke County resolution. ""The type of solar panels that are going to be installed are 10-kilowatt SolarWorld panels, costing a little over $20,000 for 36 panels,"" according to Colleen McLoughlin, the solar campaign organizer with Environment Georgia. “The coalition and the installer are going to cover half of that cost now, and Nuçi’s Space has agreed to cover the other half of the cost.""


 


McLoughlin said the installation will take no more than a week, noting that Nuçi’s Space is very properly equipped for the installation.“Out of the four that applied, Nuçi’s Space came out on top in terms of who would benefit the most from this installation and who would have the greatest impact on the Athens community,” she said.McLoughlin said a committee of 13 graded the four applicants on a range of categories. Seven of the committee members were residents of the Athens community, and six were members of the Solarize coalition.“Nuçi’s Space has a great mission, and they are super enthusiastic about this,"" she said.The solar panels are expected to last around 25 years and will reduce energy costs by about 50 percent during good months, according to McLoughlin.","Charlotte Norsworthy

14-Apr-16,Why Georgia students need to vote,"""Dear graduates of 20-whatever year it is when I come down there. You just graduated from a shady school that has the name of a shady state that tried to pass a shady law.”So begins the ad-libbed Commencement speech for the University of Georgia by one of its most famous alumni: Tituss Burgess. The comedian, of “Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt” and “30 Rock” fame, goes on to encourage UGA students to “get out of the bars” and go vote in the state primary elections May 24.My first reaction upon seeing his speech was: There’s been so many “shady laws” as of late, which one is Burgess referring to?


 


The Red & Black has fielded multiple stories on House Bill 859, also known as the “campus carry” bill, House Bill 757, the “religious freedom” bill, and Senate Bill 323, which amended the state’s open records laws.From the video, it seems Burgess was referring to the recently vetoed religious freedom bill, which would have given religious organizations the ability to effectively discriminate against same-sex couples. The bill’s ambiguity may be what Burgess would describe as “shady” with religious organizations being loosely defined as any 501 (c)(3) nonprofit that identifies as a religious entity.These laws and our lawmakers are deciding the rules by which we must obey, potentially for the rest of our lives.If that sounds like a lot of power, it’s because it is.Vague legislation can be presented for a myriad of reasons, to hide the true nature of a bill, to leave it open to further interpretations, and to avoid infringing on the rights held by us, the citizens.I personally did not vote in the last presidential primary. Why? I was too busy to go home for a day, too preoccupied with homework, internships, all those things that Graduate schools will want me to write down in an eloquent summary of my past four years. And, frankly, I didn’t care enough to haul myself to my hometown library and place a vote for a candidate I’d decided was the lesser evil.But Burgess is correct in saying that “shadiness” from our state government means we should reprioritize voting. When it comes down to it, this is another story about the importance of making your voice heard in your government.When will these stories stop? When they stop being necessary. As much as you’d like to think that as long as the government doesn’t impede queso sales, or make the eLearning Commons even harder to figure out, your life will remain unaffected — that is not the case. These are bills that affect your life as a UGA student, and the lives of your classmates and families. This legislation matters and it is your duty to, in the words of Burgess, “…put Beyoncé on pause, as devastating as that may be,” and vote May 24 in the state primary. Until we do, there will keep being people berating us for giving up hard-won democratic rights in a fit of laziness. 


 


Also, if UGA wants to reward four years of work with Tituss Burgess giving a poignant and “preach it” commencement address, I think it would make my tuition almost worth it.

18-Apr-16,Hansen’s Hits: April 18,"Kanye West finally made the financially smart decision of putting “The Life of Pablo” on Spotify, and this leaves me conflicted. I’m happy to finally be able to listen back through the album’s few highlights again, but the ridiculous hype built up for a sub-par album, in my opinion – which can be read here — risks dominating this week’s new releases. And while Kanye does earn a spot on this playlist, he does not overshadow all of the other great music released this week and definitely shouldn’t be the only thing you listen to this week.Krizz Kaliko – “Bite Your Tongue”Strange Music’s Krizz Kaliko is a talented rapper, but he shows off some great, soulful singing chops on this song. Granted, I can see this song wearing on me, but the mix of soul and electronic groove was easily my most played track this week. 


 


 Frightened Rabbit – “Get Out”A very solid alternative rock album, Frightened Rabbit’s “Painting Of A Panic Attack” was one of my favorite albums this week. The song “Get Out” specifically has a great, punchy chorus accentuated by dynamic guitar riffs and snare hits. Kanye West – “Ultralight Beam”Chance the Rapper steals this track from Kanye West. However, West definitely deserves credit for a killer minimalist beat backed with powerful chorus vocals. This easily stands as the apex of ""The Life of Pablo,"" which sadly is the opening track.    The Lumineers – “Cleopatra”While the Lumineers’s sophomore album “Cleopatra” is a bit of a departure from the group’s first outing, the album is still definitely worth giving a shot. The title track is a great example of what to expect with its story-driven presentation.  Cult Of Lune – “A Greater Call (feat. Julie Christmas)”


 


This is a monster of a track that clocks in at over eight minutes. While I enjoy the ambient build up to sludgy riffs, the interplay between the screamed and clean female vocals provide a great sense of contrast and atmosphere to the track.  Parquet Courts – “Berlin Got Blurry”Featuring one of my favorite guitar patterns this week, Parquet Courts puts this fast-paced progression at the forefront of “Berlin Got Blurry.” The bass line trucking along through the verses is also a standout element. Jean-Michel Blais – “II” Classical is a genre I don’t have a lot of experience with, nor do I have a really critical ear for it. I can’t really tell the good from bad, but “II” by Jean-Michel Blais struck me as what I consider good classical. This track is technical while simultaneously beautiful. All Saints – “One Strike”English girl-group All Saints deliver a very solid pop single with “One Strike.” The plucked guitar notes, multiple percussive elements and harmonies from the four women all combine to make a radio-ready pop song that I thoroughly enjoyed.

 Mayer Hawthrone – “Love Like That”Mayer Hawthorne’s funk-laden delivery and production shines best on the song “Love Like That."" Aside from a few modern synth lines, it sounds like it could have come straight from the glory days of funk and R&B love songs.  Woods – “Sun City Creeps”The horns and guitars meld beautifully on “Sun City Creeps” by Woods. The whole track has a slightly Latin vibe to it, which mostly comes from the percussion and accented guitar notes.",Zach Hansen @zach_ehansen,culture,https://www.redandblack.com/culture/hansen-s-hits-april/article_ed5b31ee-04dc-11e6-801f-636a002e0db0.html
19-Apr-16,The lottery: A tragic illusion,"I was excited, as many people are when they turn 18, to be officially carded for purchasing something I could not previously purchase without an adult present. The first thing I had to present my ID for turned out to be DayQuil during cold and flu season, but that’s not exactly the point. The next thing I was carded for was a more common thing: a lottery ticket. I’m not, nor have I ever been, particularly drawn to the lottery as an institution, but in the excitement of turning 18, I bought a ticket. My lottery ticket did not win, but perhaps I should be grateful for that.In Jan. of this year, Craigory Burch, Jr. was murdered during a home invasion in Fitzgerald, Ga. Just two months prior to his murder, in Nov. 2015, he won over $400,000 — Burch was a Georgia Lottery winner. Of course, correlation does not equate with causation, but it is a possibility that the murder and winning of the lottery are related. Regardless, 7 individuals have recently been charged relating to this murder.Though Burch’s situation was less-than-ideal in a very tragic, publicized way, the lottery in general is not an altruistic system either. It preys on lower-income people.


 


The lottery is a form of tax . . . and it is not a progressive tax (one such as sales tax in which the more an individual spends, the more he or she pays). Instead, the lottery is a voluntary regressive tax. The less money an individual makes, the more he or she plays, and pays, which is inherently unfair. That is to say, such a voluntary regressive tax is, generally, paid by poorer people. It works on illusion; to keep the illusion alive, someone wins occasionally, but not very often. Lotteries are just a way to spell hope for money for individuals who play the game.Lotteries also generate a different kind of hope. Or, HOPE. That’s right, I mean the HOPE Scholarship—Helping Outstanding Pupils Educationally—which is funded by the lottery. HOPE has many benefits for students, and our state, such as allegedly improving access to college, preventing “braindrain” (i.e., keeping intelligent, college-going individuals in the state), and increasing graduations rates. HOPE also leads to a sad story, however. 75 percent of HOPE Scholarships go to students from Metro Atlanta. These students would have likely been able to attend college even without the Scholarship. Naturally, this is a result of those students being the ones who apply to college, are accepted to college, and receive the scholarship; it is worth noting, though, that most of the Georgians of lower socioeconomic status live south of Atlanta. So, individuals who pay for the lottery are not the individuals who benefit from the college education it can pays for.The lottery perpetuates the exploitation of low-income people. They are exploited by, essentially, paying for the college education of individuals who likely would have gone to college even if HOPE were not an option. In its defense, the lottery also gives a percentage of its profits to the Georgia Pre-k system. I understand that abolishing the lottery as an institution is an extreme goal, so that is not what I advocate for. Rather, I argue that a percentage of the money the lottery brings in should go toward programs to help the individuals who pay into the it.- Katie Davis is a senior from North Carolina majoring in philosophy and sociologyOpinions expressed in The Red & Black are the opinions of the writers and not necessarily those of The Red & Black Publishing Co., Inc.

21-Apr-16,Conflicts with downtown venues hinder growth of local hip-hop,"With names such as Future, Outkast and 2 Chainz, Atlanta has established itself as one of the hip-hop capitals of the world. Yet less than two hours down the road, the Athens hip-hop scene has struggled to gain traction.The Athens hip-hop scene has found itself on the cusp of growth for decades, but it has yet to produce a true breakout artist. David Barbe, head of UGA’s Music Business Program, attributes Athens’ lack of a major artist to the relatively small size of its hip-hop scene.“The notoriety of a music scene is defined by its stars,” Barbe said. “I don’t know if Athens has had our hip-hop R.E.M. yet.”


 


Local hip-hop artists performed a showcase in the 2014 Athens Indie Fest at the Caledonia Lounge. In 2015, AthFest Music & Arts Festival had a hip-hop showcase. Nationally recognized hip-hop artists, such as Waka Flocka Flame, Tyler the Creator and hip-hop collective Turquoise Jeep have played at the Georgia Theatre and 40 Watt in the past year.However, local hip-hop shows are still rare. From April 21 to May 31, no hip-hop shows are set for the Georgia Theatre, 40 Watt Club, Caledonia Lounge, Flicker Theatre or Live Wire — five of downtown’s largest venues.“Athens to me is like a popularity contest,” said local rapper Crystal Fair. “It’s not even about who actually has good music, it’s all about who’s the most known; and that hurts.”Because of the lack of opportunities, some local artists venture to the bustling scene of Atlanta in search of a more responsive scene. Knowa Johnson, co-founder of the Athens Hip Hop Awards, has tried to keep artists in town.Johnson came to Athens along with his wife, Mokah, when they realized the raw potential Athens has to become a flourishing hip-hop community.“The artists should be looking at all the college students as a huge market rather than going to Atlanta where there’s already a scene — there’s already cliques. It’s oversaturated over there,” Johnson said.Rappers need not applyThroughout his three decade long career, Athens rapper Elite the Showstoppa has experienced the ups and downs of the Athens hip-hop scene.


 


“It’s not that hip-hop is dead in the city of Athens. There’s a lot,” Elite said. “Everyone and their grandma is doing something in the hip-hop community. It is just limited as far as what platforms you have.”Elite’s band, Showtime, features a live band on stage, which has proven helpful in booking shows. The artist cites his ability to improvise with a live band as a way to help book more shows downtown and at fraternities.“A lot of venues weren’t opening doors to a cat with just a microphone and a CD. You had to be a band to play,” Elite said.

Because of Showtime’s full-band appeal, it is  able to play shows with other rock bands. The group recently opened for New Mantra on April 14 at The Foundry.“Part of it is the venues are basically established rock venues,” Barbe said. “They are successful as rock venues — they have a clientele.”Elite attributes the lack of a hip-hop presence downtown to widespread backlash to 1990s “gangsta rap,” which often featured violent connotations — even though many local artists’ music do not fall into the gangsta rap category.Elite and a few others were eventually able to find venues such as Insomnia and Aftermath — both now closed — to perform at, but most of downtown was not an option. Many African Americans grew frustrated by multiple accounts of unfair treatment downtown.

“There’s a lot of artists and locals that have been frustrated with the type of treatment they have gotten, going downtown,” Elite said. “It was very in-your-face.”‘Orlando 20 years ago’In recent years, the downtown community has grown more accepting of hip-hop acts, a growth due in large part to the increasing popularity of hip-hop among college students. Although local hip-hop acts have yet to headline at venues like the 40 Watt Club or the Georgia Theatre, there has been growth.“College students grew up in the hip-hop era. They all listen to that type of music,” Elite said. “Our obstacles aren’t as great as they used to be. There are more venues that we can play at.”

This, however, has not affected the number of shows booked downtown as most shows take place in other areas of Athens. “I feel like a lot of people have lost hope,” Fair said. “There are a lot of hip-hop artists that are older and when you get to that age where you have kids, you get discouraged.”Mokah and Knowa Johnson moved to Athens in part to get artists to stay in town rather than move to other scenes. The couple moved from Florida after years of reviving Orlando’s hip-hop scene through their own media and marketing business.

“We realized there were a lot of talented artists here but the scene wasn’t consolidated,” Mokah said. “It reminded us of Orlando 20 years ago.”The Athens Hip Hop Awards has seen major growth in the past four years, as it has brought attention and unity to the local hip-hop scene. Elite has been the award show’s emcee for the past two years.“I think [the Athens Hip Hop Awards] has a direct impact on the build of the local hip-hop scene here in Athens,” Elite said. “The show brings about unity. A lot of the guys don’t know of each other, and a situation like the Hip Hop Awards allows everyone to be in the same place at the same time.”Although collaboration is a goal of many Athens artists, the hip-hop scene has remained inaccessible for the most part.With the combination of greater media attention through the Athens Hip Hop Awards, as well as artists such as Showtime booking gigs downtown, the hip-hop scene is on the rise. Yet the lack of downtown shows in the next month is proof of the work there is left to do.“I see it from two sides of the fence. I think the city of Athens is very corporate now. I don’t think hip-hop means as much to Athens as desired, from a corporate standpoint,” Elite said. “But as far as the community [goes], it means everything because it’s not just the music. It’s the culture of our city.”",Nate Bramel @natebramel,culture,https://www.redandblack.com/culture/conflicts-with-downtown-venues-hinder-growth-of-local-hip-hop/article_cf80a7bc-0748-11e6-9053-c74936b62dbe.html
21-Apr-16,What is the real value of education?,"Editors at The Red & Black, Shelby Masters and Jordan Hill, discuss in a dueling views column the question college students must face each registration period: Is it better to take easier classes in order to receive a better GPA, or take harder classes and learn more?SM: If you are Mark Zuckerberg you may not need school, but for those of us who aren’t Silicon Valley darlings, we need an education in order to gain meaningful employment. These days, to simply attend school is not enough — not when we are surrounded by peers competing for the same jobs. So here it is: the harsh truth. Numbers don’t lie. When you are compared against your fellow students what rises to the top? Not that you take piccolo lessons or worked really hard, it’s that the person whose grades are higher get their foot in the door, with graduate schools, some companies and scholarships. 


 


JH: The importance of grades in the grand scheme is overblown. Yes, you need an education to gain employment, but you need true learning to maintain it. Taking easier classes is a short-term solution to life, which I hope is a long-term equation. The challenge of taking harder classes, specifically when they relate to your future employment field, is one worth taking. There is no denying the value GPA holds. But taking a tough class doesn’t necessarily mean you’ll have a worse grade; it means you probably need to study harder and devote more time for what’s to come. If it’s a class that will be valuable past earning the credit hours you need, a student needs to take that into account at the forefront and prepare accordingly.   SM: If I may, how prepared do classes actually make you for the future in your career? I don’t think any professional career in a volatile, high-pressure workplace where you must adapt to new and challenging situations compares to the insulated world of academia. Further, if you’ll notice there’s no place on graduate school applications or HOPE scholarships explaining the myriad of reasons your class was harder than anyone who has retained the scholarship. If I have a B, and my friend has an A because of tests that are less nit-picky or fewer group projects, maybe I learned more but I will have no chance to justify a completely personal choice in an algorithm-driven world. JH: The dirty little secret so many try to ignore is classes can only do so much to prepare you for your professional world, but why not make the most of those that matter? Sure, the A-grade you received in an easier class may help you knock a few thousand dollars off your student debt, but the class that challenged you to really know the pertinent information may prevent you from being sued and therefore jeopardizing your career and your reputation in the years to come. Obviously it’s not logical to take harder classes across the board just to say, “I’ve taken the hardest classes possible.” It is, however, a good idea to know as much as you can about your respective field before you step out of Athens with only a nice GPA no one cares about and a confused look on your face. — Shelby Masters and Jordan Hill on behalf of the editorial board of The Red & Black

23-Apr-16,Keturah Orji sets pace for Georgia track and field at Virginia Challenge,"Sophomore Keturah Orji continues to exert dominance over the triple jump competition. This weekend, Orji and the Bulldogs traveled to Charlottesville, Virginia, for the Virginia Challenge.Orji, in her first collegiate triple jump competition since her NCAA indoor title, didn’t disappoint, as she jumped 46 feet 3.25 inches on her first attempt. This not only gave her the national lead by more than two-and-a-half feet but also pushed her to the third spot on the world list.Orji was not finished. She later traveled a season best of 46-3.50 to win the competition by nearly four feet. Orji’s first two jumps gave her the ninth- and 10th-best jumps in collegiate history.  She owns three of the top 10 marks in NCAA history, including her winning effort of 46-5.25 at last year’s nationals.


 


“I thought we had a pretty good showing on a different track in a different setting,” head coach Petros Kyprianou said. “Keturah was definitely the highlight of our day since she has now become consistent around the performance she had today.”Also in the women’s triple jump, freshman Aliyah Johnson worked up a personal-best mark of 41-10.75 for fourth-place honors.Also making a spot in the national top 10 list is junior Maurice Freeman. Freeman crossed the line in the 400-meter run with a second-best time of his career. His 46.59 earned him top collegiate finisher and a continued spot at number five on the national list.Asianna Covington opened the hammer throw competition with a season-best mark of 192-8, earning her third. This is Covington’s longest throw in the last two years. Covington also competed in the discus and finished fourth with a round three throw of 149-11. Freshman Hayden Merrick earned 12th in the weight throw after throwing a personal best of 168-3.In the hammer throw invite, senior Shelby Ashe was the second collegiate finisher and third overall with a toss of 201-2.  Former Lady Bulldog NCAA champion Nikola Lomnicka finished second with 211-7.Jamario Calhoun, Raytez Jenkins, Jon Okoye and Reggie Glover approached their season-best time in the 4x100m relay with a 39.86  to earn second-place honors.  The time was just .06 seconds from the Bulldogs’ best time of 2016 at the Yellow Jacket Invitational.The Bulldogs went 3-7-13 in the men’s 800m race. Senior Christian Harrison was Georgia’s top finisher with a 1:48.32 while fellow senior Kisean Smith ran a 1:48.78 to finish seventh.  The one personal best in the race for the Bulldogs came from true freshman Jeramey Hampton, who had a 1:49.81 for 13th.


 


Senior Ashley Henry was fourth in the 43-woman field of the 400m after completing her lap in 54.09.In the 100m Okoye finished in the  10th with a 10.59.“Everyone stayed focused today and we will be aiming for more NCAA regional marks on Saturday,” Kyprianou said.","Tyree Brown

27-Apr-16,"Fetty Wap late to his own show, a massive disappointment","“Doors open at 6:30, show at 8 p.m.” means nothing to Fetty Wap apparently.Opening DJ acts are meant to hype the crowd up for a brief time before the main performer takes the stage — not remain on stage for over two hours trying to stall for the main act while the crowd increasingly grows restless. Unfortunately that’s exactly what happened. 


 


The audience didn’t seem to care too much for the opening group, though it was interesting at times. The choreography performed was at least something to watch, even though the audience didn’t react.It took Fetty Wap a whopping two hours to make it out onto the stage, and then he only stayed on for about 30 minutes. Calling it a disappointment would be an understatement. The concert had been very hyped up, but Fetty fell flat.It is worth it to note that the University Union did a great job of planning this event, from the water bottles they passed out to everyone, to the people on hand ready to answer any questions asked. Fetty Wap truly dropped the ball on this one.",Emma Hunt @ehunt831,culture,https://www.redandblack.com/culture/fetty-wap-late-to-his-own-show-a-massive-disappointment/article_e92cd74c-0c81-11e6-811f-83e3733f5ccb.html
27-Apr-16,"Iris DeMent to perform at The Foundry, melds folk and Russian poetry","Ever since Iris DeMent adopted her daughter from Siberia in 2005, she had sparked a curiosity to understand more about Russian culture, specifically poetry. The country and folk singer is currently on a national tour putting Russian poetry to song.  “These are poems I set to music to understand the world that my child was formed from,” DeMent said. “From the love for my daughter, I give her back a little of her world.”The Iowa singer and songwriter will perform pieces inspired by Russian culture at The Foundry on Friday, April 29. 


 


""I try to sing from my heart,” DeMent said. ""People tend to accept it in their hard place. It’s a gift to me.”Anna Akhmatova, a Russian poet of the 20th century, is also a primary source of inspiration for DeMent’s songwriting. Akhmatova lived through a difficult time during the Russian Revolution and WWII, through which she continuously wrote poetry.""She was so greatly loved and somehow managed to survive,” DeMent said. “The fact that she could continue to write and dig down so deep without bitterness and a depth in her spirit is so inspiring.”DeMent will perform songs from her album “The Trackless Woods” with a backing trio. Pieta Brown will play guitar, Chris Donohue is on base and Paul Neihaus on the pedal steel guitar.DeMent also plays piano and guitar, which she picked up at a young age. She said that in her large family, everyone played an instrument. “The piano was like a toy in our house,” DeMent said.She began seriously focusing on her singing career in 1992. She went to Nashville a few years earlier and met people at a record label called Rounder, which led to Warner Brothers picking up several records, including “Infamous Angel.” Her cover of ""Leaning on the Everlasting Arms” went on to be featured in the 2010 film ""True Grit.” However, DeMent said the biggest accomplishment in her career is just persevering the challenges of a touring artist’s life.


 


“There [are] so many ups and downs, and then something comes along that boosts me up again, and I feel my desire and passion renewed,” DeMent said. “The friends I’ve made, night after night of being on stage, is the greatest reward.”DeMent is always hoping to see herself with another batch of songs.“You hope as you go along that you’ll discover new angle that haven’t been explored before,” DeMent said. ""I hope for something that I can create that opens new places in me.”",Angelina Lewis @LinaLewis13,culture,https://www.redandblack.com/culture/iris-dement-to-perform-at-the-foundry-melds-folk-and/article_00e3819c-09c1-11e6-b476-3fc8c62e3091.html
6-May-16,"Balance, speed key for Twilight bikers","Tomorrow several amateur and pro racers will take to the streets of downtown Athens, hoping to take a win in the 37th annual Athens Orthopedic Clinic Twilight Criterium.Three-time Twilight champion, Tina Pic, said she has trained intensely for her race.“For motor pacing, I ride behind a car or scooter, and the idea is to go faster than the race so you can work on leg speed,” Pic, who races for the Happy Tooth Dental Professional Cycling Team, said. 


 


But, for a biker, balance—not just speed—is key.The physics of bike riding has been subject to many scientific studies, as they are complex vehicles. They lack stability while in a stationary position but remain upright as long as they are mobile.“Most commonly people attribute the stability of a bike to gyroscopic effects associated with the spinning wheels of the bike, but this is only one factor,” said Dr. Susanne Ullrich, associate professor in the Department of Physics and Astronomy. “The physics are complex and depend on various geometric, inertial and gyroscopic features of the bicycle.”She said a rider can remain balanced by steering the bike in the direction of a fall and can steer by turning the handlebars or leaning their body.“In general, a bike and its rider stay upright as long as the center of mass remains over the wheels,” Ullrich said.It is important that the rider maintains his or her balance, Ullrich said. While the gyroscopic nature of the wheels and the trailing contact point, created by the tilted steer axis and the fork offset, are helpful to sustain balance, they are not the only factors.“In fact, it is suspected that bike rideability is correlated with self-stability,” Ullrich said. “In other words, a good self-stable bike is easy to balance and ride.”But staying upright is just half of the game—a rider must be able to steer themselves gracefully as well, she said.


 


“For a bike to turn, the front wheel must aim into the desired direction of travel, and the friction between the wheels and ground generate a centripetal acceleration that redirects the bike,” Ullrich said.She said the biker will experience centrifugal force as he or she whips around a curve and must lean their body into the turn in order to maintain balance. The biker must lean more fiercely depending on the strength of the curve and can sometimes even prepare for it with a little counter-steering.As bikers move quickly, more resistance to wind is built up. In fact, the biker’s own body tends to create more drag than the bike itself.“Bikers, therefore, wear tight clothing and aerodynamic helmets, and bike components are shaped for minimum wind resistance,” Ullrich said.",Mia Falcon @miae467,athensnews,https://www.redandblack.com/athensnews/balance-speed-key-for-twilight-bikers/article_00d66e66-1331-11e6-8ba7-8fba004005ab.html

7-May-16,7 different gift ideas for Mother's Day,"As May rolls around, we can all relate to this tweet, “Mother’s Day is hard when your mom deserves an island, but you can only afford a candle.”Mother's Day is hard when your mom deserves an island but you can only afford a candle— College Student (@ColIegeStudent) May 8, 2015


 


This spring, ditch the candle, and surprise your mom with something that while still not an island, should still shake up this year’s Mother’s Day. Here are eight gift ideas to shake up this year’s Mother’s Day.1. Go for the experience … a spa dayTreat your mom to a day of therapeutic scents, steamy saunas and soothing massages. It isn’t always the material things that will make her smile – sometimes she just needs a day in paradise. You could book a spa session in your local health resort or engage those creative senses and recreate it in your own home with candles, bath salts and relaxing music.2. The ballet or concertBelieve it or not, every mom is waiting desperately to wear that dress they bought last year to something fancy. They get stuck with the same everyday routine and responsibilities that restrict them from getting out of the house as much as they’d like to. You know your mom and whether she’d like to go to the ballet or jam out to a rock concert with you, she’s sure to appreciate it no matter what.3. Workout gearGet your mom pumped to burn some calories with a new gym outfit or two. It’s a great way to motivate and inspire moms, while making them look and feel great.4. Make dinner


 


It may be hard to believe that sometimes, but mom probably wants to sit down at the table and enjoy a homemade meal made by someone other than herself. Decorate the table nicely with fresh flowers. Preparing her favorite dinner and add little touches that you know would make her smile.5. A new eye-makeup setUpgrade her eye-game with a new makeup palette. Find fresh shadows that would brighten her eyes. Match it with a complementary liner and mascara. This creates an inexpensive gift set that she hasn’t gotten before.6. Something for the homeLet’s face it, our moms did all the decorating to make our homes as cozy as possible. Buy a simple, neutral piece to replace or add to an existing piece in your home. Snatch a new lampshade to replace that dusty pink one. Find a furry rug to warm those dark wooden floors. Either way, it’ll be something she can look at and always think of you.7. Back to the basicsIt may seem cliché to buy flowers and chocolates, but sometimes that’s all that it takes. Know your mom’s favorite flower and buy it in bulk. Skip the drug store flowers and look into finding a fresh, healthy bouquet with vibrant colors. Stick to one flower type as opposed to mixing and adding filler flowers. Bundle the bouquet in a paper wrap rather than plastic for an authentic, thoughtful look.",Angelina Lewis @LinaLewis13,culture,https://www.redandblack.com/culture/different-gift-ideas-for-mother-s-day/article_537450c4-1409-11e6-854c-5b29909a437e.html

12-May-16,UGA Small Satellite Research Lab plans launch for 2018,"All systems are go, and the University of Georgia is ready for lift off.The UGA Small Satellite Research Lab has not only received funding from National Aeronautics and Space Administration and the United States Air Force to build two space-bound satellites, but they also have a launch date planned for 2018 from the International Space Station.“From the beginning it’s been in the planning process, getting the proposals ready, but now we’re moving to the phase of heavy research and development,” said Graham Grable, a sophomore mechanical engineering major from Watkinsville.


 


Grable is part of the mechanical and flight team, responsible for the engineering and structural design of the satellites.“The CubeSat is basically in an aluminum frame, with a whole bunch of different components inside, and so those components vary from our payload, which is like a camera and our spectrometers,” Grable said.The names of the two satellites, CubeSats, or SmallSats, are SPOC and MOCI.SPOC, or Spectral Ocean Color, will analyze the color of the ocean beyond a visible spectrum.SPOC will help the team understand how water runoff influences the environment and what materials are present in water runoff. ""It will help us better understand climate change and how we can mitigate it,” said Caleb Adams, a senior computer science major from Powder Springs.MOCI, or the Mapping and Ocean Color Imager, will scan the Earth’s surface and use the images to create 3D maps.This will be the first time this has been tried from low earth orbit, said Jaicob Stewart, a senior computer science major from Newnan on the software and project management teams.


 


“This is traditionally done from low altitudes on earth,” he said. “We’re trying to do this from low earth orbit with a smaller camera.”Stewart is pioneering a brand new software to employ on these satellites.“Basically the resolution of the images we’re taking will have to be much lower, so they're pretty much pixelated, and we’re going to try to, based off those low resolution images, develop a still accurate or somewhat accurate 3D model of what we were imaging,” Stewart said. The ideas for the functions of the satellites came from faculty members.The Small Satellite team has received support from professors, including Deepak Mishra from the Department of Geography and Malcolm Adams from the Department of Mathematics.The team was also provided lab space in the Physics Building, which they are updating.The team has even designed its own mission patch, much like the ones worn by NASA astronauts on their space suits. “It’s kind of symbolic of our mission,” said Paul Hwang, a sophomore graphic design major who designed the patch. 


TNCMS.AdManager.render({region: 'fixed-big-ad-bottom-asset', slot: 1, fold: ""below""});


“[We’re] building up the UGA SmallSat Lab brand,” he said. “When people are looking to invest in our cubesat project, that’s what they see.”The patch features an exaggerated image of MOCI and in the background Hwang included the constellation which includes a star named after UGA.The UGA star was named by Roger Hunter, a UGA alumnus who works for NASA Ames. Adams said Hunter was working on a Keppler Project to scan for planets outside our solar system, when he noticed a star in the Lyra constellation that was as far away as the university is old — thus, UGA 1785 was born.“We put that constellation on there as an ode to Roger Hunter and the grander visions of where we could go,” Adams said.The SmallSat team is trying to raise funds to build a ground station to control the satellites from Athens, a vacuum chamber to simulate how the satellites will function in space and a clean room for constructing the optics for the cameras on the satellites, Grable said. Each of these buildings will contribute to the SmallSat team’s bigger vision of creating a space program at UGA.“Before, this was just like ‘Hey, let’s build a satellite,’” Adams said. “But now, it’s like, ‘Hey let’s make a space program. Let’s make this stay. Let’s keep it going.’ But we don’t have the funds to keep it going.”

13-May-16,Geography student group scrambles for leadership as current officers graduate,"Today, 4,343 University of Georgia students will graduate in Sanford Stadium, including several on the Geography Undergraduate Student Organization leadership board.The organization, also known as GUSTO, was founded in April 2015, and replaced GeoDawgs, which dissolved two years ago due to a previous lack of leadership.With the graduation of all its leadership board members this evening, GUSTO is scrambling for new officers and members to ensure its sustainability. Luckily some members have stepped up to safeguard the budding club during the transition.


 


“Our goal is to keep GUSTO afloat now,” said Christine Kil, president of GUSTO and senior geography and international affairs double major. “We’re struggling, but we’re really trying to set the foundation right now, so that it’ll continue and grow next year.”This past semester, Ansley Heller, a fifth-year geography and English double major, stepped up as club event coordinator because the survival of this organization is important to her.“The reason we decided to be officers and to keep the club going, even though we’re graduating, is because we all see the benefits of this club,” Heller said. “We know it needs the backbone of leadership to keep it going, and we hope that by our keeping it going through this semester, it’ll be able to get even more people and continue in the future.”What makes recruitment difficult for GUSTO is the size of the Department of Geography. Only about 90 undergraduate students are enrolled in the program, a low number Victoria McKenney, GUSTO's public relations chair, said is partly due to a lack of understanding of what geography is.The idea that geography teaches critical thinking and social justice may not register in a lot of people’s mind, but McKenney, a senior geography and public relations double major, said those concepts are what her geography classes have taught her the most.For instance, geography challenges these students to entertain questions such as why Sanford Stadium is considered the center of UGA's campus.“If you look at the map, the stadium is technically not in the center, but we’ve socially constructed it to be the center — everything south of it is South Campus, and everything north of it is North Campus,” Kil said. “It stems from what we Americans as a society are drawn to.”As human geography and physical geography are the two main disciplines within the major, one of GUSTO’s goals is to bring the students from the two branches together to learn from each other and to provide them with the resources to connect to graduate students and professors in the department, McKenney said.


 


“The club helps foster discussions that may have been hit on in class, but in a less formal setting in which students can talk about these things with their peers,” said Katie Arney, member and junior geography major.The club hosts a monthly meeting as well as educational and fun activities, including visiting labs, watching movies, eating potluck meals and bringing students on special campus tours.Despite its struggles, GUSTO saw a turning point April 21 at a campus tour the group held to teach students about racialized spaces at UGA. The turnout of about 40 students gave the officers a refreshing morale boost.David Porinchu, associate professor of the Department of Geography who started GUSTO, said the club is good for both the faculty and the students because it not only increases the amount of enthusiasm and energy for geography, but it only helps the department increase its exposure directly to other students.Porinchu said since the organization has moved past its infancy, it is imperative to start developing programs students want to attend and that encourage them to join the club.“For me, it wouldn’t take much for GUSTO to be considered successful,” Porinchu said. “If we have 10 or 15 students showing up consistently, I think that would be fantastic.”Jackson Montrym, treasurer and senior geography and biology double major, said its goal is ultimately to spread awareness about geography and expand the major by knitting a community among geography majors.“But of course that’s not something we’re gonna see right now,” Montrym said. “That’ll be hopefully in a few years.”

5-Jun-16,Singer-songwriter Allen Stone to perform at Georgia Theatre,"Washington-native Allen Stone is making his way across the country to Athens on a tour promoting his latest album, ""Radius."" The Georgia Theatre will be hosting the R&B singer-songwriter on Wednesday, June 8.Stone combines genres and breaks musical boundaries to cultivate his unique sound.As his website states, “on his third full-length album, singer/songwriter Allen Stone proves himself deeply devoted to making uncompromisingly soulful music that transcends all pop convention.”


 


Stone’s latest album, the third full-length one he has released to date, was created in collaboration with Magnus Tingsek, a Swedish musician and producer. ""Radius"" is about the “creative connection” and “transport[ing] the listener to a higher and more exalted plane,” according to Stone’s website.“The radius is that line extending from the center of the circle to its exterior,” Stone said, “and in a lot of ways this album is about getting out things deep inside — whether it’s love or insecurity or joy or frustration about things going on today.”Stone and Tingsek worked together to make the album as radically unique as they possibly could, working and reworking through songs to make sure they would make the impact intended.For Stone, the creative process is more than just making music that sounds good — it’s about being able to affect his audiences in ways that move past the initial listening experience.“There’ve been times in my life when records were my saving grace and really helped me to figure out who I am, and I’d love for my music to have that kind of impact on a kid who’s looking for his or her own place in this life,” Stone said.",Emma Hunt @ehunt831,culture,https://www.redandblack.com/culture/singer-songwriter-allen-stone-to-perform-at-georgia-theatre/article_c622f83e-29ba-11e6-8529-2fbcaa5e4da5.html
6-Jun-16,Local advocacy group repairs bikes at Athens-Clarke County library,"When Alvin Dye took his son to the Athens-Clarke County Library Sunday, he may have expected to check out a book or two, but he certainly didn’t expect to have his son’s bicycle fixed.BikeAthens, a local bicycle advocacy group, gathered outside the library to offer free bicycle safety checks, repairs and helmets.“We stopped by the library...[and] my son had a flat,” Dye said. The BikeAthens volunteers fixed the younger Dye's bicycle. 


 


Patrick Stanley, a local bike specialist, said the group from BikeAthens repaired around eight bikes in the two hours it was stationed outside of the library.“We’re doing some minor tuneups for people who need them,” Stanley said.We had a great time w/ @solarchef & others, fixing up #bikes and handing out helmets thanks to the @AthensClarkeLib! pic.twitter.com/lU95dS7bvn— BikeAthens (@BikeAthens) June 6, 2016Beside offering the free safety checks, Stanley also presented a program called “The Family Tree of Bicycles.""“[The Family Tree of Bicycles is about] about some of the history of the bikes, of bike companies and how bike companies in different countries have kinda shaped bike culture both within bike culture as a whole and within world culture,” Stanley said. “It’s kind of a survey of how bike companies started and been acquired by other companies.”According to its website, BikeAthens’ goal is to “promote walking, cycling and public transit as solutions to transportation needs in Athens through education, advocacy and community service.”“Many library patrons ride their bike to our facility,” said Angela Stanley, head of archives and special collections at the Athens-Clarke County Library. “We support BikeAthens’ mission of encouraging equitable alternative transportation.”

9-Jun-16,Editorial: Cheating the system,"Students are prone to cheating. Not all students — many complete honest work. However, the problem exists, and we would be doing ourselves a serious disservice as a student body by ignoring this issue.While ethical and moral aspects of cheating continue to be debated, there is a larger issue at hand. The fact that students feel pressured to cheat to get ahead and make the grades that determine our future says something about the kind of education we are getting. While it is good to be challenged is there a point when it becomes too much? Why is it that students feel the need to use Google translate to help with their foreign language homework just so they can spend more time working on their online chemistry quizzes with peers? The grade received by a student may be enough to pass, but is that student retaining any valuable information? Are we actually learning or are we so desperate to scrape by that the honor code becomes a mere suggestion in our minds?Both situations — using Google translate and working on online quizzes with peers — are defined as cheating in the University of Georgia’s academic honesty policy. Many students have probably never even read the first page of that policy, and don’t even know they’re cheating.


 


We must ask ourselves if the education we are pursuing motivates us  to learn or leads us to cheat to keep the scholarships that allow many of us to attend this school in the first place.Many argue that by failing a course you simply didn’t work. Though that might be the case, a majority of us students are just struggling to make ends meet balancing  jobs and coursework, not to mention trying to maintain our sanity on this emotional rollercoaster we call college.  We push students to be perfect, and in doing so we push students to the brink. At some point the shaky foundation that is our education system gives way, and students turn to cheating.Technology adds to the issue, and opens the door to a whole new way of cheating. There is a thin line between sharing notes on Google documents and sharing answers.  Though many use these resources responsibly, when one student crosses the line it puts the entire student body in jeopardy.The issue with cheating is not one of good vs. bad — students are competent enough to know cheating is wrong. The issue is that there is no way to effectively monitor it. There isn’t a concrete solution when technology is constantly advancing.It’s on us as students to police ourselves. If we can’t get through college without completing honest work then the conversation should be what that means for our education system and what universities should be doing to recognize the problem instead of ignoring it.—Nicolle Sartain on behalf of the editorial board of The Red & Black",Nicolle Sartain,opinion,https://www.redandblack.com/opinion/editorial-cheating-the-system/article_55024b94-2e76-11e6-8a21-ab4034f973e1.html
9-Jun-16,Georgia commit Trey Blount uses family as motivation,"Pace Academy strength and conditioning coordinator Clement Rouviere walked into the Knights’ weight room. His eyes were wide and his mouth hung slightly open.It was July 2015 and Rouviere returned from overseeing the annual ""Iron Knights"" competition where Pace football players are evaluated on their physical skills. He has worked with thousands of high school and collegiate athletes over the years, including former NFL record-holding wide receiver Calvin Johnson. Not much surprises him anymore. But, that day, junior wide receiver Trey Blount’s performance in the vertical jump left the witty Frenchman struggling for words.


 


“[Blount] literally stepped on the platform to jump and kind of looked around like, 'What am I supposed to do?'” Rouviere said, recounting the story a year later. “He comes back down and says, 'Uh, did I do anything wrong?'”After registering a height of 38 inches, Blount certainly did nothing wrong. The average for a wide receiver in the vertical jump at the 2016 NFL scouting combine was 34.4 inches. Plus, having joined the team three weeks prior, there hadn’t been time for Rouviere to teach Blount the correct form.Had Blount known the proper technique, his performance would still be impressive, but the fact that he jumped that high without knowing how to maximize his hang time or efficiently use his arms is nothing short of astonishing.""He's a freak athlete,"" Pace head football coach Chris Slade said.Over the last year, Blount has turned his natural athleticism into 27 Division I scholarship offers, and on May 1, the Class of 2017 four-star wide receiver publicly announced his decision to play at the University of Georgia.“I grew up a Georgia fan, and Georgia has always been a school I told myself I would go to if I ever had the opportunity,” Blount said. “What's better than playing for the home state and bringing back a national championship?”It sounds simple: athletic marvel plays football and is offered scholarships. While that’s partially true, Trey’s journey hasn’t always been that easy.


 


Courtesy Fred AssafA special connectionBorn Joseph Cecil Blount III, Trey began playing football at age seven, but only because of some trickery from his father, Joseph Cecil Blount Jr., who goes by Cecil.“The previous year, I took him to a football practice, and he heard the coaches yelling and screaming,” Cecil, who played quarterback at Division II Jacksonville State in the late 1980s, said. “Trey said, 'Dad, I don't think I want to play.’”The following summer, Cecil took his son to “Coach Disco’s Football Camp” in Powder Springs. At the day-long camp’s conclusion, Cecil asked Trey if he wanted to play football. Having spent an entire day running around and making new friends, Trey’s response was an emphatic “yes.”“I immediately ran over to the place to sign him up,” Cecil said.


TNCMS.AdManager.render({region: 'fixed-big-ad-bottom-asset', slot: 1, fold: ""below""});


Blount played defensive end and was an option-style quarterback until he switched to wide receiver in seventh grade. A year later, he was an Eastbay All-American, now known under the name of Football University, recognized as among the top youth talents in the nation. It was then he realized there was potential for him on the football field.He has since practiced in the dead of winter and ran sprints in the blistering heat of a Georgia summer to reach his goal of playing professionally. But that dream isn’t what fuels him to push his body past its limits. A dog tag hanging on a silver chain that dangles from his neck and the words that are transcribed upon it does.It reads: “Jared C. Blount, 12/19/06, I miss you, God bless.”Trey never takes off the dog tag. In a way, it’s fitting that when he wears it during games his shoulder pads press those words into his chest, just above his heart.Jared is Trey’s younger brother, and in 2006, he was Trey’s Christmas present. A life-long devout Christian, when 8-year-old Trey wanted a younger brother, he prayed for one. On Dec. 19, 2006, Jared was born. Cecil said the two were instantly inseparable. “He's always had a special place in my heart,” Trey said.“I miss you” might lead one to think Jared has since passed away, but he is alive and well. He just so happens to live three states and hundreds of miles away. When Blount’s parents divorced in 2008, his mother moved to Texas with Jared, while Trey stayed in Georgia with his father.“That whole year it was tough,” Blount said. “Honestly, when I played football that year I was mad. If you were in the way, then I'm sorry, but you were going to get all the pain that I was feeling. I calmed down, but it still gets to me sometimes.”Blount talks with his younger brother every day, but it’s difficult not to live in the same house, much less the same time zone. They see each other during breaks from school, most recently, this past Christmas.

Despite that separation, the brothers’ bond remains a unique one. Sure, they pick and nag at each other like brothers do, but Cecil said Trey would “jump off a cliff for his brother” and that Jared tries to follow in his older brother’s footsteps every chance he gets.“The motivation of wanting to help my brother [inspires me], because that's who I do it for,” Blount said.A different persona Despite showing promise as an eighth grader, when Blount finished his sophomore season at Hillgrove High School in Powder Springs, he said he had nine catches for 115 yards and zero touchdowns.“I don't think my coach had trust in me,” Blount said. “He told a lot of people that I had a big head, which I really try not to.”Hillgrove head football coach Phillip Ironside was unable to be reached for comment this story.Unsatisfied with their situation, Cecil and Trey began the process of transferring.One night, Cecil was browsing the internet for possible schools. He began to think about the quarterback at each one and remembered Gunnor Faulk transferred to Pace before his freshman season. Cecil knew Pace’s academic reputation, and having Faulk at quarterback along with a former All-Pro NFL linebacker for a head coach in Slade excited him.

Pace accepted Trey, and this past season, he led the Class AA Knights with 38 receptions for 686 yards and 10 touchdowns to help the team to its first state title in the program’s eight-year history. In addition to starting at wide receiver, Blount was also used as a kickoff and punt returner, a safety on defense and a third-down pass rusher.His performance garnered national attention, as coaches from across the country came calling. Football was fun once again, but adjusting to life at a new school presented challenges. Blount may be an electric player on the field, but he doesn’t have the same persona off of it.“It was tough my first semester here. I didn't feel like I fit in,” Blount said. “I'm a little shy if I don't really know you. I didn't know how everyone would react to me being me.”Cecil said his son has always been naturally reserved. Before one of his first football games, Cecil looked over and saw his son away from the team reclining against a fence. He walked over to ask him what was wrong. Trey replied, “I’m getting ready for the game.”“He's kind of to himself a little bit,” Slade said. “He does his own thing, but that's not always a bad thing… He's a very respectful young man.”Courtesy Fred Assaf

A multi-dimensional manWhen Trey isn’t on the football field, he can usually be found fiddling with technology -- he wants to major in Electrical Engineering -- playing NBA2K on his Play Station 4 or in the kitchen, baking.“I just like cookies,” Blount said. “No one made them for me, so I was like, 'I guess I got to learn how to make them myself.' So, I started baking cookies and then my sisters taught me how to cook pies and bake cakes.”He began baking three years ago and usually makes his baked goods from scratch. His favorite desserts to make are chocolate chip or white macadamia nut cookies, but he can also whip up a sweet potato pie and pecan pie.The limited kitchens in residence halls at Georgia may prevent him from baking regularly once he arrives, but his ability on the field will be a welcome sight to head coach Kirby Smart, who has been trying to add speed to the Bulldogs’ roster since he stepped on campus.Hours before Blount committed, the no. 1 wide receiver in the 2016 class, Demetris Robertson, announced his decision to play at the University of California instead of Georgia. Landing a verbal commitment from the no. 35 receiver in the country for the class of 2017 softened that proverbial blow, and his own speed will certainly put a smile on Smart's face. Scout.com lists Blount’s 40-yard dash time at 4.39 seconds and Blount said he consistently runs it in 4.4 seconds.There are always ways to improve, though, and Blount said he wants to eliminate the cardinal sin for a wide receiver - dropped balls - before arriving in Athens. Slade added that he wants to see Blount maintain a consistent level of intensity throughout the game. ""He's gotta be a dog, no pun intended, but he's got to be a dog all the time,"" Slade said.

It’s impossible to peek into the future to see how Blount contributes for the Bulldogs. But at 6-foot-3, 197 pounds and with the speed, explosiveness and length he possesses, he is certainly an intriguing prospect. Especially because Slade thinks he’s just getting started.“He's just so raw,” Slade said. “I think that he has a lot of potential that's been untapped, which is a good thing.”Blount has a year to continue developing his game, but when he does arrive on campus, it will be a dream that started when he was 7 years old coming to fruition. And, when he steps onto the Sanford Stadium turf for the first time, you can bet Jared will be there cheering louder than anyone.","Wilson Alexander

13-Jun-16,Athens-Clarke County commissioners propose first bike-lane master plan changes since 2001,"After nearly 15 years, the Athens-County County Unified Government announced its plans to update its bicycle master plan — a map of where existing and proposed lanes are located in the city. The project to update the plan, which hasn’t been changed since 2001, has been called a priority by Athens-Clarke County commissioners.Tyler Dewey, the executive director of BikeAthens, a cyclist advocacy group, said an update is years overdue, arguing that the plan should be updated every few years in order to keep up with the changing needs of the city.  “The standards have changed,” Dewey said.


 


For the past year, it has been BikeAthens’ campaign to encourage the county to update the plan.“We’ve been in constant contact with commissioners and staff trying to push for a new bike master plan sooner rather than later, and they eventually found a way to budget for it which is the biggest obstacle,” he said.Commissioner Kelly Girtz of District 9 also said Athens needs an updated plan to meet the needs of residents. Although there are no specific details yet about the plan, Girtz said now is the right time to make a change.  “We’ve seen lots of new development around town. We’ve seen some areas of town become energized by bike and pedestrian activity that have not been [in the past],” he said. “There are still lots of areas that are disconnected that are not ideally safe.”In data released by the University of Georgia and obtained by The Red & Black through BikeAthens, Clarke County has the fifth highest rate of car on bicycle collisions in the state of Georgia and is the only county in the state where the motorist is deemed at fault in the majority of these accidents. And when compared as a percentage of population, Clarke County climbs to the top of that list.According to records obtained by The Red & Black from the Athens-Clarke County Police Department through an open records request, since 2001 — the same year the bicycle master plan was last updated — there have been 474  motor vehicle accidents involving a bicycle. Many of these accidents occurred on streets such as Prince Avenue which lack sufficient bicycle lanes. This lack of safety on Clarke County roads has been an issue of concern for local cyclists who call for more bicycle lanes and better connectivity between existing lanes.“I feel unsafe sometimes when cars drive by too close to me,” said Abby Mistretta, an alumna from UGA who graduated this May, who used to ride her bicycle to class everyday. “A lot of drivers in Athens don’t know how to drive around cyclists . . . I feel there should definitely be more bike lanes because I feel safer on roads with bike lanes.”Dewey said the update would make Athens a safer place for cyclists and motorists alike.


 


He said the more people who utilize bicycle infrastructure, the more comfortable motorists are around cyclists. Commissioner Link echoed this idea, saying that more cyclists on the road would slow traffic and lead to a decrease in the number of collisions.“Congestion is not necessarily a bad thing,” Link said. “It slows traffic.”Commissioner Link said the lanes indicated on the master plan would be created as roads are repaved as well as through other implementation tactics and could take decades to fully complete.This has raised concerns that the bicycle master plan would be outdated before it can be fully implemented. Dewey said he hopes for the plan to be updated before then.“In other communities, they’re updating their bike master plan every five to 10 years,” Dewey said, “It’s normal and expected that every decade you take a look at your plan and update it.”Girtz said the hope going forward is to update the plan every five years to account for emerging traffic phenomena.Girtz said the projects created by the updated bicycle master plan would ideally be paid for with T-SPLOST funds, funding levied from a tax at the local level for use on transportation projects. Girtz said it would be money coming into the system which they don’t already have.“I’m excited just because it’s something we’ve needed for a while,” Girtz said. “I hope to be seeing it really soon.”

Clarification: A previous version of this article was titled ""Athens-Clarke County commissioners propose first bike-lane changes since 2001.""

21-Jun-16,Department of Computer Science hires more faculty to keep up with national trend,"In April, frustrated with the limited availability of upper-level computer sciences classes at the University of Georgia, computer science major Heather Huynh started a petition on Change.org calling for increased funding and resources to sustain the growing department. As of press time, the petition has received over 1,000 signatures.At the time, Alan Dorsey, dean of the Franklin College of Arts and Sciences, said the college was working to resolve the issue and was in the process of hiring more professors for the Department of Computer Science. “In the spring, we hired about seven new faculty; two assistant professors, four lecturers, and one instructor,” said Dr. Thiab Taha, department head for the computer science department. “They will be able to teach a good number of classes.”


 


Taha said each lecturer and instructor will teach three courses per semester, while the assistant professors will teach one course each for their first semester. All seven professors will begin teaching in the fall semester.According to an open records request, the department received $533,000 in increased funding to hire the faculty members, with the Franklin College of Arts and Sciences providing $339,000 and the Office of the Senior Vice President for Academic Affairs and Provost providing $194,000 through the Presidential Informatics Hiring Initiative and the smaller class size initiative.Taha also said the department opened five new sections for the fall semester, “so now everyone will probably want to get into these courses.”However, while the new faculty allow for more class options, some courses may still see crowding, he said.”It depends on what course [whether the number of students in each course goes up],” Taha said. “We would like to see the number of students in each course below a certain number.”The issue of overcrowding comes as the Department of Computer Science continues to grow year to year, seeing a 20 percent increase in undergraduate and graduate enrollment, from 742 in 2014 to 892 in 2015, and a 147 percent increase since 2009, when the department had only 360 total enrollments, according to the department’s Spring 2016 newsletter. The department also has “close to 137 minors,” according to the newsletter.With the graduate enrollment holding steady across the seven years, the majority of the program growth has come from a tripling of undergraduate enrollment. Computer science now ranks at the fourth most popular major at UGA, according to the 2015 UGA Factbook, behind biology, psychology and finance.The increase in program enrollment mirrors the increase in job opportunities for those with a degree in computer science. According to the U.S. Department of Labor Bureau of Labor Statistics, software developers, computer and information research scientists, computer and information systems managers and computer hardware engineers see median yearly salaries of over $100,000, with increasing 2014-2024 job outlooks, most of which are listed as “faster than average” or “much faster than average.” 


 


With a healthy and growing marketplace for computer science majors, Taha said it is hard to predict the future growth of UGA’s computer science department.“It looks like there will be an increase. How much, I don't know. This is a national trend,” he said. “Georgia State is having the same issue, and Georgia Tech, though maybe not to the same magnitude. But this isn't just in Georgia. It's a national trend because there are so many jobs available for graduates of computer science.” Taha said the faculty hires should be able to handle the anticipated enrollment growth, but for good measure, he will be requesting at least one more faculty member in 2017.",Nate Harris @nwithan8,uganews,https://www.redandblack.com/uganews/department-of-computer-science-hires-more-faculty-to-keep-up/article_e5d7f65e-37b4-11e6-93c7-7759b8a9cc9d.html
22-Jun-16,A defense of safe spaces,"How common has the word oversensitive become? It seems like it dominates the millennial culture. Every time a professor gives a “trigger warning” before lecturing on something disturbing, some people seem to get outraged that someone would be offended — part of the growing politically incorrect mindset. We’re told to toughen up and deal with it. Counseling and sensitivity have become synonymous with weakness. But that is the worst thing to tell my generation when research shows that untreated depression is the leading risk for suicide among youth. While listening to a NPR Politics Podcast, I heard reporter Sam Sanders get choked up while talking about the recent shootings in Orlando and Charleston. 


 


“It hurt me to think that in America today, there is still a need for safe spaces. Shouldn’t all the spaces be safe . . . ?” Sanders said.And then I got choked up. I’m not a member of the LGBTQ or black community, but I had a need for my own safe space in middle and high school. Sander’s emotion compounded with those recent tragedies brought me back to a vulnerable time in my life.I was once an overweight, introverted, acne-ridden, nerdy kid who had a major inferiority complex. I was afraid to talk to most people for fear of being judged — even if it was something as inconsequential as saying “hi” to someone. There were even rumors that circulated that I was gay, only adding to my torment. I feared I would never be able to build friendships. I thought I would end up alone, a straight man trapped by the illusion of my sexual orientation. I became critical. I could pick out every single flaw about myself and every perception I couldn’t overcome. I never admitted these feelings, except offhand to a few friends and my parents, which is why I was never clinically diagnosed for depression. Then things turned darker. If I can’t overcome my insecurities, what’s the point? These thoughts never persisted for long, but they occurred. I never admitted these thoughts until I began writing this. No one knew — not even my mom until I told her before this published for fear of shocking or worrying her.Looking back, I realize what helped me through: my hometown church. In that space were the people who cared for me most. I had youth pastors and adults willing to sacrifice their time to help me, acting as impromptu counselors. While I haven’t spoken to some of these people in years, I haven’t forgotten what they’ve done for me. I write all of this not to draw attention to myself but to show how crucial safe spaces are. I use my own example since, as a straight, white male from a loving family without money troubles, there are variables that would have crippled me if I had to deal with them. I don’t know what has happened in the lives of those that went to Pulse that night or what brought those to the church in Charleston. However, I do know what my hometown church and the people within it did for me. It was the one place where I felt most at ease, like I could be myself without fear of judgment. 


 


As much as certain safe spaces and “trigger warnings,” might not make sense to you, someone close to you could be going through something difficult. The last thing I’d want to do is push someone towards depression or suicide due to criticism or negligence, so it is important to recognize the significance of safe spaces. Err on the side of caution, as you never know what could push someone over the edge.For me, all it could’ve taken was the wrong person saying the wrong thing at the wrong time, and I might not be here today.—Zach Hansen is the managing editor at The Red & BlackOpinions expressed in The Red & Black are the opinions of the writers and not necessarily those of The Red & Black Publishing Co., Inc.

26-Jun-16,"Arrested Development, a group that never goes out of style","Saturday evening, on a 90 degree summer day at Athfest, Arrested Development drew in an audience at the main stage who were ready to jive to music that feeds your soul and leaves you wanting more.Arrested Development performed songs such as ""Tennessee,"" ""Mr. Wendall"" and ""Every Day People"" that epitomize positivity.Arrested Development is an alternative hip-hop group that has been around since 1988 and has not gone out of style. It is now 2016, and the group's cool and refreshing sound floated into the audience with ease while everybody grooved to the music with smiles on their faces.

27-Jun-16,Best of AthFest: Highlights from some of the best performances this weekend,"Whether you went to AthFest and got to see the performances in person or you sadly had to miss out on the fun, you can still get the low down on what happened this weekend with this ""best of"" recap. With hundreds of performances throughout the three days, it's difficult to choose the top artists. Here are five performances worth reading about.WrennWrenn wowed festival-goers with her signature playful stage presence and hodgepodge of jazz, folk and retro-pop. The mix of heavy aesthetic elements — like her now familiar flower-covered keyboard — and bubbly song choices set the tone for a fun performance that had the crowd bouncing, dancing and clapping along throughout.


 


Simply put, Friday’s performance proves that Wrenn — who has said her motto is ""Fake it ‘til you no longer fake it"" — has no need to fake anything. The variety of fast and slow-paced songs, the unfaltering beat and heavily emphasized jazz-pop tone offered a more refined, full sound than those performed at last year’s AthFest, leaving audiences eager for her next show.MothersThe slow-changing colored lights and deep fog set a dreamy ambience for the show — one true to the sentiment of Mothers.As typical of the band’s sound, these songs featured slow, lulling melodies, coupled with intervals of fast-paced guitar. The crowd responded to both energies, from stillness and slow swaying to full-body dancing.Athens proved just how receptive it was when Mothers played “Lockjaw,” a clear crowd favorite, as fans lurched to the jolting rhythms and sang back the elegiac lyrics.Black LipsThe garage rock band with a distinctively southern feel, drove much of the crowd into a frenzy.Toilet paper, eyeglasses and empty beer cans were all being thrown around the 40 Watt Club. The toilet paper hung from the ceiling and it was impossible to tell if the pools of liquid on the floor were spilled beer or sweat from people dancing.


 


The concert achieved absolute bedlam when the Black Lips performed Bad Kids, one of its most popular songs, as much of the crowd erupted into a mosh pit and more toilet paper rolls flew through the air.The Hot Hotty-HotsFrom the opening number, a snappy swing selection, through some of the slower, more soulful tunes like “Stormy Weather,” the music had the audience ready to either settle in with a glass of brandy or kick-up their heels in ragtime dance.Not to be outdone, each instrumentalist — playing sax, tuba, trombone, piano, guitar and drums respectively — had their turn performing featured solos, all of which were delightful, entertaining and astonishingly well-played.Parker GispertParker Gispert’s soft-toned indie rock performance at the Georgia Theatre on Saturday was an intimate affair, featuring quietly powerful vocals and amazing guitar skills. He created a pleasant new variation on the pounding, wickedly loud sound typical of the lead singer and guitarist for The Whigs, the renowned American garage-rock band from Athens.While it was a pleasure to hear older work, it was even better to hear new songs including “What’s the Point if There’s Not One” and “Soon Comes Fast,” an end-of-an-era style song about not wanting to grow up and another which references aliens, Star Trek and Madden’s Holy Roller.",Staff Reports,athfest,https://www.redandblack.com/athfest/best-of-athfest-highlights-from-some-of-the-best-performances/article_97e0b81c-3ca2-11e6-912c-1b1a347740ab.html
27-Jun-16,UGA researcher looks to improve the accuracy of mono diagnosis,"According to the research of Mark Ebell, a University of Georgia professor in the College of Public Health, many doctors, when presented with a case of mononucleosis will see the symptoms and often misdiagnose the illness as Streptococcal Pharyngitis, or strep throat.If the patient has mono, addressing the illness, a viral infection, as strep throat, a bacterial infection, causes detrimental effects because the use of antibiotics leads to bacterial resistance to these medications.“The CDC, the White House, the Institute of Medicine and most major medical groups have come out strongly against the use of antibiotics when unnecessary,” Ebell said. “They increase costs, can be harmful and lead to antibiotic resistance.”


 


Ebell said antibiotics are not needed in the “vast majority of acute respiratory infections, since they are caused by viruses.” Mono is caused by a virus.As a follow up to his earlier educational reviews, Ebell looked “to systematically review the literature regarding the value of the clinical examination and white blood cell count for the diagnosis of mononucleosis” in his April 2016 study.“I did our current study because there had never been a good systematic review of the best way to diagnose infectious mononucleosis,” Ebell said.This early, accurate diagnosis of infectious mononucleosis is what Ebell is looking to showcase in his next study and further research, which could assist clinicians in finding correct treatment, avoid antibiotics and provide an accurate diagnosis.In his April 2016 study, Ebell and his colleagues evaluated literature over the last 20 years to view how limited the ability to make a correct diagnosis was.What they found is that while literature is still fairly inadequate for mononucleosis diagnosis, the best determinants of mono were swollen posterior cervical or axillary lymph nodes, fatigue, an enlarged spleen and the percentage of a patient's white blood cells that are lymphocytes or atypical lymphocyte.“[Noticing a large amount of] lymphocytes [especially atypical lymphocytes] can be helpful when mono is suspected by a physician, especially early when the MonoSpot test may be falsely negative,” Ebell said.To expand on the lack of literature available, Ebell’s findings don’t end with his study. Ebell intends to collaborate with the University Health Center to study patients to “see if he can develop a decision support tool that can identify patients with mononucleosis based on the history and physical exam.”

29-Jun-16,Current and former Georgia baseball players compete for summer teams,"While the college season may be over for the Georgia baseball team, it’s a year-round sport for many of its players. Rising sophomore catcher Michael Curry is currently playing summer baseball for the Strasburg Express in the Valley League. With a batting average of .304 with seven RBI, Curry is a big part of the team’s 14-6 start to the summer season that has it on top of the North Division.Third baseman Mitchell Webb is also playing in the Valley League, lending his services to Charlottesville. He is batting .267 with a homerun and six RBI so far this season.


 


While Curry and Webb took their talents out of state, brothers Drew and Logan Moody and pitchers Addison Albright and Adam Goodman have stayed in Georgia to play for the Savannah Bananas in the Coastal Plain League. The Moody brothers have been particularly successful for the team, with Drew pairing a 3-0 record with a 3.08 ERA and Logan owning a .373 batting average and eight RBI in only 14 starts. Goodman holds a 1-0 record with a 7.59 ERA while Albright is 0-2 with an 8.52 ERA.First baseman Adam Sasser is also playing in the CPL, putting together a .197 batting average for the Lexington County Blowfish.Outfielder Keegan McGovern and pitcher Kevin Smith are both playing for the Orleans Firebirds in the Cape Cod League. McGovern is struggling with a .188 average in 12 games played while Smith has put together an impressive 0.81 ERA in 11 innings pitched.Three Bulldogs are playing for the New England Collegiate Baseball League. Patrick Sullivan is suiting up for the Keene Swamp Bats which lead the Northern Division despite him hitting just .140 through 12 games.Pitchers Blake Cairnes and Andrew Gist are both playing for the Newport Gulls, while the former is 1-0 with two saves in five games played while the latter is 0-2 with a 3.21 ERA in three games.Trey Logan is the lone Georgia player in the Southern Collegiate League, helping the Piedmont Pride to a Southern Division leading 16-5 record. Through 21 games played he is batting .203 with 12 RBI.Five of the six Georgia players selected in the MLB draft earlier in June have signed contracts and four of the five have made their professional debuts.


 


Outfielder Stephen Wrenn has been particularly impressive, batting .311 with three home runs in just 10 games with the Tri-City Valley Cats. Wrenn homered in his first ever professional at-bat.Skyler Weber is hitting .300 for the AZL Athletics through five games, while pitcher Bo Tucker has put together a 2.70 ERA in three games for the Orem Owlz. Heath Holder has had one relief appearance for Grand Junction so far, and Robert Tyler has yet to make his debut for the Boise Hawks.Pitcher Connor Jones is the only Bulldog selected who has not signed a professional contract yet. The 11th round pick of the New York Yankees has until July 15, the deadline for teams to ink college underclassmen and high schoolers, to sign with the club.","Nathan Berg

30-Jun-16,Brexit: Students studying in Oxford feel aftershocks of UK’s break up with EU,"University of Georgia students in the UGA at Oxford study abroad program witnessed a once in a lifetime vote as the United Kingdom chose to leave the European Union.On June 23, the world looked to the U.K. as more than two-thirds of the country’s citizens went to polls and voted on a single issue that had the potential to affect not only the U.K. or even just Europe — but the entire world. The vote, a referendum now commonly known as Brexit, was promised by British Prime Minister David Cameron to anti-European Union members of his own Conservative Party in exchange for his re-election in 2013 and decided whether or not the U.K. would remain a part of the E.U. or if it would leave it. 


 


The final vote came down to an almost even split. With approximately 52 percent of voters choosing to leave the E.U. and 48 percent choosing to remain, the British split its ties with the treaty organization it had been a part of for 71 years since it joined in 1945 at the end of World War II. The E.U. was first set up to prevent more wars from starting between the neighboring European countries. The U.K.’s decision has the potential to affect the United States — and by extention all UGA students — in the long run as markets adapt to consequences of the break up.But there has been the group of UGA students who are attending Oxford University in the U.K. through the UGA at Oxford program and have felt the effects of the Brexit decision almost immediately.

Many of the students participating at Oxford have been closely keeping up with the referendum debate for the past few weeks. “Before the vote there was a lot of people campaigning for both sides in the city center,” said Michael Johnson, a junior from Fayetteville who was with the UGA at Oxford June semester. “I had multiple people approach me with flyers trying to sway me, but I had to tell them I was an American. I was very into the decision, not because I enjoy politics, but because I knew it was such a monumental thing.”  Grace Cagle, a sophomore from Milton who is participating in the UGA at Oxford program, said that most UGA students at Oxford were shocked by the results of the referendum.“The director of our program told us the U.K. would most likely remain in the E.U., and the clamor would soon die down,” Cagle said. “There seems to be an air of unrest and tension here we can’t escape.”


 


Cagle said she is concerned for her future travels in the country because of the outcome of the vote on the demeanor of the country. “We are all stunned,” said James McClung director of UGA at Oxford program. McClung, who has been with the program for a few years, said he thought the Brexit vote would play out similarly to the referendum held in Scotland in 2014 for the country’s independence from the U.K.“I felt that the vote would play out in fashion very similar to the Scotland referendum in 2014,” he said. “[I thought] it would poll closely, but on the actual day there would be a 60-40 split in favor of remaining with the E.U. As you have seen, the result is a very close swing the other way.”One of the most immediate changes for UGA students in the U.K. this summer has been the change in the monetary exchange rate.  The British pound is at its lowest value in the past 30 years after taking a hit the night of the referendum. The day of the referendum, June 23, the British pound was worth about $1.50 in U.S. dollars, according to the XE Currency Encyclopedia. Then 24 hours later, the pound dropped in value by almost 12 percent and was worth only about $1.34. Since the referendum, the pound has not fully recovered to its previous worth. It rose some between the June 25 and 26 then began to drop in value again since June 27. As of press time, it was valued around $1.32.

According to the XE Currency Encyclopedia, the day of the Brexit referedum, the British pound was worth $1.50, then dropped to $1.34 by the next day.

“In the short term, the destabilizing effect on the British economy, and the weaker pound will mean that our students have greater purchasing power while they are here,” McClung said. “The longer term could mean reduced university services and access alongside increased costs.”

Because the pound lost value, the U.S. dollar now has more worth in the U.K. said Santanu Chatterjee, an associate professor of economics at UGA. “The students right now in the U.K. will be able to buy more because of the depreciation in the British pound,” Chatterjee said. Not all UGA at Oxford Students have benefited from this new exchange rate, however. Cagle said because she turned in her dollars for pounds earlier in the summer, when she first arrived in the U.K. now that the value of the pound has dropped, her purchasing power has gone down significantly. “My purchasing power has gone down, and I’ve essentially lost dollars due to the high exchange rate when I first arrived,” Cagle said. “I walked by Barclays [Bank] earlier. It was three hours before it was to close yet they had already locked their doors. There was a line of people outside attempting to exchange their money before the value drops further.”

It’s not just students at UGA at Oxford who are feeling the effects. The U.S. is one of the largest sources of inbound tourism to the U.K. in the world, with nearly 2.75 million Americans visiting the U.K. in 2015 and approximately 300,000 of those visitors being college-aged students, according to visitbritian.org.As of yet, it is hard to tell what the U.K. leaving the E.U. will mean for Americans in the U.K. Chatterjee said the biggest outcome in the coming years will be uncertainty. 

“As Britain begins the two-year long process of negotiating its departure ... the next 24 months are likely to see quite a few changes in the social, economic and political arenas,” McClung said. “[The fact that] our students got to witness this up close will make for a wonderful learning opportunity, but those of us who oversee programs will have to make sure we stay on our toes.""",John Hammel @jphammel,athensnews,https://www.redandblack.com/athensnews/brexit-students-studying-in-oxford-feel-aftershocks-of-uk-s/article_d0982dba-3e7e-11e6-8487-fbd1bb321a84.html
1-Jul-16,Independence Day in Athens to be celebrated with fireworks and a festival,"For some students, the Fourth of July is a holiday spent with families back in their hometowns. However, a lot of students stay in Athens for the Fourth of July to celebrate with friends. Thankfully, there are several activities to do in Athens for the holiday weekend.On Monday July 4, the Oconee Veterans Park is hosting live music on the lawn along with games and a firework show after dark. Though it might be a bit of a drive, the fireworks show is worth it. The festivities begin at 6:30 p.m., and the park entrance is free to anybody.Patriotism is worth celebrating for more than one day, though. On Friday July 1, downtown Athens will feature a festival beginning at 5 p.m.


 


The festival will have bouncy houses, food carts, face-painting stations and art vendors throughout the downtown area. Dwight Wilson and the Classic City Soul will play live music downtown at 7 p.m. A beer garden will be available at South Kitchen and Bar located on Washington Street. The activities, games, art and live music will be throughout Washington Street and College Avenue.At 9:30 downtown on Friday night, a fireworks show will occur with fireworks launching from the rooftop parking deck of the Classic Center. The show can be viewed throughout the entire downtown street area and beyond. Because of the event, note that certain streets will be closed and parking downtown will be very limited.For safety purposes, the Classic Center parking deck will be closed and off limits because of the fireworks and dangers from burns.The whole spectacle downtown is free just as the other events are. People of all ages are welcome, but the event is especially great for families with children.",Kellie Kratzenberg @redandblack,culture,https://www.redandblack.com/culture/independence-day-in-athens-to-be-celebrated-with-fireworks-and/article_1d1642ae-3f9b-11e6-aa21-0ff26ff395f5.html

8-Jul-16,Law School honored for public works,"For its work in providing unmet legal needs to underserved parts of the United States, the University of Georgia School of Law was awarded the State Bar of Georgia’s Law School Excellence in Access to Justice Award.The UGA School of Law was selected for the award because of its “Working in the Public Interest” — UGA Law Student Access to Justice Project, a group-led, student-run conference. Public law practitioners from around the world travel to this conference held by UGA Law students to speak about public issues and provide networking opportunities to students interested in public law, according to the law school’s website.“The conference highlighted how various members of the community — from attorneys to students — can come together to deal with the challenges those without access to legal representation face,” said Law School Dean Peter B. Rutledge.

11-Jul-16,SEC Season Previews: Auburn looks to bounce back from last year's 2-6 record in conference play,"Coming into last season, Auburn football had a lot of reasons to be optimistic.Gus Malzahn was entering his third season as head coach. The Tigers were only two years removed from a BCS National Championship game appearance and they had reeled in consecutive top-10 recruiting classes which included one of the top national recruits, DE Byron Cowart. Many pundits believed Auburn would be Alabama’s toughest competition for the SEC west title, and it came into the season ranked as the No. 6 college football team in the country.But it wasn’t meant to be for Malzahn’s squad. Uninspired quarterback play from starter Jeremy Johnson and replacement Sean White held back an Auburn offense that was forced to settle for field goals too often in 2015. Despite lofty expectations, it managed just a 6-6 regular season record, although the Tigers did take out Memphis in the Birmingham Bowl.


 


This year, Auburn has a much higher mountain to climb in terms of convincing the rest of the SEC that it can compete in one of college football’s most competitive conferences. The questions start at the quarterback position once again, an area the Tigers did not do much to address in the off-season.Johnson is the incumbent starter and has the strongest arm on the team, but his touchdown-to-interception ratio of just 10:7 from a year ago leaves much to be desired. White’s passing was less erratic, but he threw for only one score on 143 attempts last year. The team also added junior college transfer John Franklin III to the roster. The former East Mississippi Community College player is an exciting dual-threat prospect, but his production thus far has come against competition far inferior to what he’ll see in the rugged SEC west.It’s a mystery who will be behind center for the Tigers in 2016, but the passing game will have to improve if Auburn wants to take a step forward from last season.Things won’t be easy for whoever that starter is, as Auburn’s only star receiver from a year ago, Ricardo Louis, left the school to join the NFL. The team is left with Marcus Davis, Jason Smith and Tony Stevens as its starters at wide receiver. The three upperclassmen combined for only 561 yards in 2015, about 200 yards shy of the mark Louis set by himself. The Tigers also lose 312 yards of receiving production from running backs Roc Thomson, who is transferring to Jacksonville State, and Peyton Barber, who is now with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. Perhaps the one prospective bright spot on Auburn’s offense this year is the return of running back Jovon Robinson. Robinson had a strong finish to the Tigers’ 2015 campaign, going for 90 yards or more in five of the team’s final six games. Auburn has had a 1,000-yard rusher in each of the past seven seasons, which is the longest streak the SEC has ever seen. With not much competition for Robinson in the backfield this year, it is a streak that is likely to continue. On defense, Auburn looks to be much more sound. Although the Tigers did not fare well last year, finishing ninth in total defense in the SEC, they have the players to make vast improvements on the defensive side of the ball. They return stars Carl Lawson and Montravius Adams on the defensive line, and although Cowart was disappointing in his rookie season, 2015’s No. 1 national recruit will look to improve in his sophomore year. Auburn also signed DT Derrick Brown this year, the top recruit in the state of Georgia. With all that compiled talent, Auburn’s defensive line has the opportunity to be one of the most dominant units in college football.Linebacker will be a more troubling position to account for, as the team loses three starters from last year. Tre’ Williams is the only returning player who has logged significant snaps for the Tigers, but graduate transfer from Illinois T.J. Neal brings needed experience to the middle of Auburn’s defense. The team’s secondary has a good chance to take a big step forward in 2016. Paramount to the Tigers pass defense is budding star cornerback Carlton Davis. Davis is coming off a rookie season in which he made 56 tackles to go along with eight pass breakups and three interceptions. His play was good enough to garner a selection to the All-SEC Freshman team, and he will be Auburn’s top corner for at least the next two years.  The team also returns former Georgia standout Tray Mathews and enforcer Rudy Ford. This pair of experienced safeties should prevent teams from going over the top of the Tiger defense.


 


The biggest question mark on the defensive side of the ball for Auburn is the coordinator, Kevin Steele. He is the third defensive coordinator the Tigers have seen in as many years, and his predecessors have not had much success with similarly talented squads. If Steele can manage this unit better than Ellis Johnson and Will Muschamp did before him, Auburn should be able to hang in with virtually any other team in the country defensively.After a disappointing 2015 in which the Auburn Tigers finished just 7-6, Malzahn has a lot of questions to answer. Given the talent on the team’s roster and the multiple top-10 recruiting classes, mediocre seasons are simply no longer acceptable. The current quarterback situation throws an SEC title berth this year into serious doubt. However, Auburn’s defensive talents, particularly along the defensive line, should be strong enough to grant the team at least one or two more wins than it had last year.","Nathan Berg

14-Jul-16,Georgia loses Class of 2017 commitment,"According to the AJC’s Jeff Sentell, Class of 2017 wide receiver Xavier Jenkins has de-committed from Georgia.Jenkins committed to Kirby Smart’s staff back on Feb. 12. The 6-foot-3, three-star receiver is from Lowndes High School in Valdosta and is the No. 94-ranked wide receiver in the country.Jenkins’ decision comes on the heels of a wave in momentum on the recruiting front for Georgia. The Bulldogs had received six commitments this summer and three in the last 10 days to give them the No. 2 recruiting class in the country before July 14.


 


His de-commitment leaves Georgia with two receivers in the 2017 class in four-star Trey Blount and three-star Matt Landers. However, Georgia is going after a pair of four-star wide receivers in Jeremiah Holloman and Mark Webb Jr. Holloman is the No. 28 wide receiver in the country and Webb Jr. is ranked No. 15.All rankings obtained from 247Sports, unless otherwise noted.","Wilson Alexander

15-Jul-16,Column: Atlanta Braves likely to promote top prospects this summer,"In early April, most Major League Baseball teams began their 2016 season, full of optimism about bringing home a World Series Championship.However, for the Atlanta Braves, their 2016 season is just about to get underway.Everyone knew coming into this season the Braves were going nowhere. The only real thing to look forward to was the arrival of heralded young prospects later in the season.


 


Now, that time has arrived. With the trade deadline fast approaching, the Braves will be looking to deal away some of their veterans in exchange for even more prospects. Outfielders Nick Markakis and Jeff Francoeur, infielders Erick Aybar and Gordon Beckham, and pitcher Arodys Vizcaino will all surely draw interest. While fans may hate to see these players go (especially Francoeur, who was once a rookie phenom for Atlanta), there is a silver lining.They will get a sneak peek of the future.According to ESPN’s Keith Law, the Braves possess the top farm system in all of baseball. Since the front office committed to a rebuild after the 2014 season, the club has traded away almost every star of note in exchange for scores of prospects. After a year or two of seasoning in the minors, many of these prospects are almost ready for the show.Perhaps the most eagerly-awaited prospects are the infield duo of Dansby Swanson and Ozzie Albies. The pair developed a tight friendship in spring training this season, and in late June Albies was sent back to double-A Mississippi from triple-A Gwinnett so he and Swanson can play together.They are both shortstops by trade, but Albies has been moved to second base. Since the start of July, Albies is hitting a scorching .426, while Swanson is hitting a more modest .273 with four home runs. Both are expected to get a cup of coffee in the big leagues this September, but could arrive sooner if Beckham and/or Aybar is moved.But it’s not just the talented pair up the middle in the pipeline. Third baseman Rio Ruiz has batted .276 at Gwinnett this season, and he could perhaps get a call up this September as an audition for the starting third base job next season.Speedy outfielder Mallex Smith will soon return to the big club from a broken thumb that has kept him sidelined. Fellow outfielder Dustin Peterson has batted .276 this year in Mississippi, and he could also get some playing time in Atlanta depending on if Markakis and Francouer are traded.


 


Where Braves fans should really be excited, however, is the pitching.The Braves have emphasized acquiring talented young pitching prospects in trades over the past two seasons. Some of it has already ascended to the majors. In his first full season, Matt Wisler has pitched to the tune of a 4.47 ERA in 2016. Mike Foltynewicz has battled injuries, but he has shown flashes of dominance at times. Tyrell Jenkins was called up at the end of June, and he has made several appearances out of the bullpen.Now the next wave of pitchers is on the way. Lucas Sims and Sean Newcomb are both talented prospects that haven’t put up the greatest numbers, but could still see some time this September in a bullpen role. John Gant made several solid starts before an injury placed him on the disabled list, and he will fight for appearances once he returns as well.Help is on the way for the bullpen as well. Mauricio Cabrera has touched 103 mph with his fastball, and he has allowed just two runs in six innings since being recalled. A.J. Minter has zoomed all the way from single-A to double-A while allowing just one earned run in 19.2 innings. He should also get a look as a potential closer, especially if Vizcaino is traded away.With all these prospects waiting in the wings, it’s easy to see why many Braves fans are excited for 2017 and beyond. The regular season may be practically over, but the season of hope, excitement and evaluation is just beginning.","Jed May

18-Jul-16,Letter to the Editor: It’s time to let education innovation and opportunity thrive,"Imagine a bi-partisan commission focused on one of America’s most pressing national issues. Imagine a consensus opinion on what needs to be done to save generations of American youth at risk.Now imagine ignoring those recommendations. Unthinkable to some, but this is the sad reality we face today.Some 40 years ago, “A Nation at Risk: The Imperative for Educational Reform” was published, a groundbreaking report of President Ronald Reagan’s National Commission on Excellence in Education, which called the American public to arms. It impressed on them the urgent need to refocus on a robust education for our nation’s youth.


 


Nearly half a century later, we have forgotten this report’s impactful message. We forget it produced a generational commitment to education reform. Our commitment to education is shaken, and in danger of collapsing at the very moment a nationwide commitment to real, lasting education reform is needed.Education reforms enacted over the past few decades have been the driving force for better outcomes for millions of kids. Public, private, school choice, as well as charter schools and other innovations created real opportunity — literally lifting children from poverty.But recent nationwide scores are a glaring reminder of how far we still need to go.  Just 37 percent of all 12th graders are making the grade in reading and 25 percent in math, according to the 2015 performance results by The Nation’s Report Card. The achievement gaps are sadly growing among minority kids.You might look around and see so many school choice and charter options and ask where the evidence is of innovative education opportunities slowing down?Consider Washington, D.C., where education reform efforts are central to the District’s rebound, transforming its business, residential and even tourist climate. Even there, charters are notably under fire for being illegally underfunded compared to traditional schools and this system of education has still been met with success.Charters were started under the notion of freedom from broken, bureaucratic rules in exchange for accountability to get to the end goal of radically improving children’s lives. Now, as states re-impose unrelated regulations on charter schools they are dangerously close to causing these schools to become the very thing they sought to change.There’s a path forward, however.We can use the lessons of today’s innovative economy, where a teenager with a bright idea can both change the world and become a business titan. In every field – from medicine to finance – advances are made today by trying new things, and disrupting old systems.


 


Everywhere, except education. There, it’s the same old excuse, “It can’t be done.” We can’t innovate because the decisions about our children’s learning are still largely regulated by outdated, inflexible laws.We need to radically rethink everything education. Our children are growing up in an increasingly global, digital world. They hail taxis on their smartphone. They interface & communicate on screen, all day. And yet they’re in classrooms facing a blackboard.The greatest need in education today is for learning opportunities to be built to fit the age of digital innovation. For real progress we need an environment that welcomes this innovation rather than rejecting it.Innovators need to be players in the game, instead of working on the sidelines tossing their products into the court and hoping someone  likely someone raised on a one-size-fits-all textbook - catches them and chooses to use them.Improved educational outcomes require innovation and opportunity throughout the education landscape.It is time to offer freedom to those who want to engage in real innovation — freedom from burdensome regulations, yes, but also freedom to disrupt and engage new models and modalities.Let’s reinvigorate the basic principles that started a generation of education reform and charter schools. That means defining accountability as learning, and finding wholly new and meaningful ways to measure actual progress.We must carve opportunities to match each student’s own needs with the institutions or learning environments that might best serve them. To do all of this, we must ensure that money is available to fund students wherever they are, and that education policy focuses on allowing innovation, creating opportunity and yielding results.

19-Jul-16,Paralympian Jarryd Wallace prepared for busy summer,"Jarryd Wallace lounged on a cherry-red bench at the Foley Field track, animatedly listing off hot spots to visit in Nashville. From a bar hidden inside a library to a bowling alley that doubles as a highly-rated brunch location, Wallace knows the city like the back of his hand since his fiancé resides there.  Riding off a bachelor weekend at the Blue Ridge Mountains with his close friends, his wedding has been a major priority for him this summer. Well, that and the Rio 2016 Paralympic Games.  ""The wedding is scheduled three weeks after Rio,"" Wallace said. 


 


Wallace will be doubling as a world-class athlete and a doting fiancé this summer, juggling his morning workouts with planning the rehearsal dinner. The wedding itself–scheduled at Smithonia Farm in Georgia–may seem like a far cry from the Paralympics located in Brazil, but Wallace has always had an unparalleled focus.  That focus is what sets Wallace apart at the track when sprinting the 100-meter race.  ""I started visualizing [about the event] two or three months ago,"" Wallace said. ""I haven't let myself think about crossing the finish line yet, but I've thought about how the first 20 or 30 meters will go."" The focus doesn't stop there as Wallace will set this year's Paralympic 100-meter gold medal as his phone's wallpaper for extra motivation. The 26-year old has an intense drive and focus to win it all. Those factors have always been a part of him. And after he was diagnosed with compartment syndrome in 2010, overcoming adversity became a part of him as well.   ""It's an absolute honor to be a Paralympian,"" Wallace said. ""Now I'm more honored to be a Paralympian than an Olympian really. There's a lot of pride in being a Paralympian and representing the United States. I'm blessed that through a tragedy, the Lord has brought me where I am now and have an awesome platform to do what I love and also share my story.""  Wallace had his leg amputated below the knee after a career in running cross country and both the 800-meter and 1,600-meter in track and field. Things completely changed when he quickly transitioned to become a sprinter after the life-altering surgery. With hard work and dedication, he was able to succeed as he placed 6th in the 400-meter race at the 2012 Paralympic Games. But not without a little help from his coaches.  


 


And this year, it's Georgia associate head coach Ken Harnden that will be there for Wallace.  ""We're planning on winning it all,"" Harnden said.Harnden started working with Wallace a year ago in hopes of Paralympic gold. From the trials to the rigorous work outs, Harnden has been with Wallace every step of the way.  But it's not without a little trial and error. Even though Harnden is both an Olympian and an NCAA champion, he has never competed as a Paralympian and therefore doesn't know what it's like.So figuring out what works for a Paralympian can only be found through communication.  ""I don't know what he [Wallace] is going through so it's all about him telling me what works and me responding to that,"" Harnden said. ""I'm used to working with able-bodied athletes so it's a different experience for me working with a Paralympian.""  Wallace and Harnden take to the videotapes when confirming what can be done in order to improve. The tapes, along with a regimented strength program, give Wallace the tools to compete with the best of the best.  From that, the two want Wallace to not only keep his start consistent and the middle of his race strong, but to mainly remain healthy.  


TNCMS.AdManager.render({region: 'fixed-big-ad-bottom-asset', slot: 1, fold: ""below""});


Wallace considers the extra time he has to practice until September to be an incredible advantage in getting to the top of his game. His days are structured from sipping his Ethiopian coffee in the morning, to warm ups, practice and an oatmeal and caffeine break in the afternoon, to finally his videotape sessions.  And this all circles back to his never-ending focus Wallace possesses. No matter how many things are going on in his life–from a wedding to his second Paralympic Games–the ultimate goal is to dream big.  In the sports realm, his dream this year is to win gold.  ""I'm thinking of this as more of a business trip,"" Wallace said. ""It was such an amazing experience to be on the team in 2012. This year, I'm coming in with some big goals and expectations and hoping to bring a couple of medals with me when I come home.""","Allie Bailey

21-Jul-16,Baseball update: Moody brothers making their mark in Savannah,"Editor's note: All stats are as of Monday, July, 18 , 2016Members of the Georgia baseball team have continued playing baseball into the summer months in an effort to keep their skills sharp for the upcoming season.Three Bulldogs have impressed enough this summer and have played in their league’s All-Star game.


 


Rising sophomore Logan Moody, who is playing for the Savannah Bananas in the Coastal Plain League (CPL) this summer, started at first base in the CPL’s All-Star game. Moody went 2-for-2 in the game and is hitting .372 with eight stolen bases and 16 RBI overall for the summer.For the Newport Gulls in the New England Collegiate Baseball League (NECBL), rising junior Blake Cairnes has evolved into a reliable arm in the back-end of the bullpen. Cairnes has not allowed a run through 12.2 innings and has saved four games so far this summer. He even pitched an inning in his league’s All-Star game this past Monday.Rising sophomore Trevor Tinder is another Georgia pitcher who is excelling this summer. Tinder earned an All-star appearance of his own by representing the Winter Park Diamond Dawgs in the Florida Collegiate Summer League (FCSL). He struck out the side in the FCSL All-Star game and has 3.50 ERA in seven starts this summer for the Diamond Dawgs.Rising senior Andrew Gist is teammates with Cairnes on the Newport Gulls and is having a solid summer of his own. Gist is 3-2 in five starts with a 3.37 ERA with 34 strikeouts in 32 innings.Also in the NECBL but playing for a different team from Cairnes and Gist is rising sophomore Patrick Sullivan. Sullivan is struggling for his team, the Keene Swamp Bats. He is hitting just .143 with one home run and three RBI.Logan Moody is playing with three Bulldog teammates this summer on the Bananas, one of which is his brother Drew. Drew, a rising senior, is 3-2 with a 3.57 ERA over six starts with one complete game.Two other Bulldog pitchers who are playing on the Bananas this summer are rising sophomores Addison Albright and Adam Goodman. Neither pitcher is finding the same success as Drew Moody though. Albright has a 6.00 ERA, and Goodman has an 8.10 ERA.Rising sophomore Adam Sasser is also playing in the CPL for the Lexington County Blowfish. The first baseman is hitting just .190 with six RBI.


 


Keegan McGovern, a rising junior, and Kevin Smith, a rising sophomore, are playing in the Cape Cod League. Smith has pitched well to a 3-2 record with a 2.65 ERA. McGovern’s bat has gotten off to a slow start this summer as the outfielder is hitting .161 with three home runs with seven RBI.For the Strasburg Express in the Valley League, rising sophomore catcher Michael Curry is hitting .283 with one home run and nine RBI.Mitchell Webb is also playing in the VL this summer but for the Charlottesville TomSox. The rising junior third basemen is batting .264 with one home run and eight RBI.For the upcoming season, the Bulldogs will look to improve upon a 27-30 mark from last year and that work begins now with these summer-league teams.","John Durham

22-Jul-16,Georgia delegate offers insight into role of delegation at Republican National Convention,"Brad Carver, an attorney in Atlanta and chairman for Georgia’s 11th Congressional District, who has been involved with the Georgia GOP for years, attended the Republican National Convention this year for the first time as a delegate.Carver said his main job at the convention is to promote unity in Georgia Republican Party around nominee Donald Trump.The Red & Black reach out to Carver at the convention for some insight into his ideas about the election and the role of a delegate at the RNC.


 


The Red & Black: Why did you decided to become a delegate?Brad Carver: Well I have been in the Republican Party and involved in the Republican Party since I was in high school. I started out as a neighborhood leader, and then a precinct chairman and then the House chairman and then I became a vice chairman of my county, Fulton County, then I ran to be a congressional district chairman. I’m responsible for Fulton County, Cobb County, Cherokee County and Bartow County.R&B: Are you in charge of scouting different candidates for different seats and helping promote those candidates?BC: I do. My job is to support all of our candidates most importantly being our congressman, but then I also support our state representatives, our state senators, county commissioners, mayors, city council.R&B: So how many times have you been a delegate?BC: This is my second time [at a convention]. I was an alternate delegate four years ago. This is my first time as a delegate. I consider it like a lifetime achievement.R&B: For all your work in the party?BC: That’s right. In other words, I’ve done it now, so it’ll be an opportunity for someone else the next time.


 


R&B: What do you think the Republican Party has to offer young people, especially the 18 to 25 group?BC: Well I think if they look to the fact that we are $19 trillion in debt that at least the Republican Party is talking about solutions to that cause we can’t continue on this path. We are headed down a path toward bankruptcy like Greece, and what that means to people who are your age is their futures are being leveraged.That’s a situation where they are ultimately going to have to pay that price. In my opinion, we have to come together as parties. We are going to have to have entitlement reform. We are going to have to reform social security. We are going to have to reform Medicare. We have to control a lot of out of control spending, and I just think at the end of the day the consensus opinion is the Republicans are more fiscally responsible than the Democrats.R&B: Now just a little bit about coming together and uniting. Obviously there has been some trouble with that in the past couple of days. How do you feel about the roll call battle that occurred and whatever D.C. did? What do you think the problem is there and how do you think Donald Trump and the Republican Party should correct it?BC: My view on the subject is I think probably 65 percent of the people who were in that room really favor the position that the rules would not be changed. Perhaps we should have done a roll call vote cause I think it would have made it really clear to everybody where everybody stood. I can tell you that an overwhelming number of people from the Georgia delegation are supporting of Donald Trump. We are the fifth largest delegation, and we are supporting Trump and unifying our party.We also have California sitting right in front of us. They are a group that is twice as big as we are. They were unanimously in support of Trump. The New York delegation as well … That’s five of the six top states. Ted Cruz had a lot of support in Texas. If you think about it, that’s five of the six top states that are very supportive of Donald TrumpR&B: Just to clarify, what rule was it that was being debated or changes being debated?BC: Well the main thing was there was an attempt among the Never Trump people in the rules committee to have a minority report. That minority report would have given perhaps an opportunity to unbind the delegates cause right now we are bound in the state of Georgia the law requires me to vote for Marco Rubio.


TNCMS.AdManager.render({region: 'fixed-big-ad-bottom-asset', slot: 1, fold: ""below""});


R&B: Because Marco Rubio won your congressional district?BC: Marco Rubio won Fulton County, the area that I was in, so I am actually a Marco Rubio delegate. Donald Trump actually won our congressional district barely, but Marco Rubio certainly won the county. He won Clarke County, too.R&B: That was the only county outside of the Atlanta circle that he won?BC: Cobb County, Fulton County, DeKalb County and Clarke County.R&B: Do you think Donald Trump is doing a good job of reaching out to Never Trump supporters? Or do you think Never Trump supporters are being too stubborn with their attempts?BC: Well, I’m going to be honest with you, I’d like to see a little bit more movement on both sides. I think the Never Trump people need to get on board cause in my opinion if we get 90 percent of the Republican votes, we are going to win this election. Donald Trump is going to win the independent vote. He’s already showing that.The only way we don’t win this election is if we don’t have a unified Republican Party. But I think we are going to get there. I think 80 percent of the Republicans are on board with Donald Trump, and I think by the end of this weekend, and later this week, we will be at 90 percent.R&B: What do you think about Mike Pence being chosen as the vice president?

BC: Well, I wanted Newt Gingrich. He would have been my choice. Great for the state of Georgia. He’s brilliant, smart, incredible. But, I think Mike Pence is a good choice. I think Mike Pence was a unifying choice.I think Donald Trump’s weakness is among the conservative voters, and Mike Pence is a solid conservative.R&B: While Mike Pence certainly appeals to the Christian conservative in the party, are you concerned that their views don’t necessarily align a lot with things, for example trade, is a big splitting point between them? Do you think that could be a problem going into the election?BC: Well you know, Donald Trump certainly talks about fair trade rather than free trade, and even I’ve heard Newt Gingrich talk about this. We need to be looking at those trade deals and making sure they are right for the United States. Within the day, it is Congress that sets the legislative parties, and I am a free trade guy. That would be one of the areas where I am a little concerned of what our presidential nominee supports.But policy is about compromise, and I do think that Donald Trump brings up some really good points. One of the reasons he is getting such appeal across working class America is the fact that they feel really hurt by the trade policies that we have had in the past.R&B: It’s hard to see the benefits of them because even if they have benefits they are usually pretty discrete?BC: Well that’s right. You know. In general, I think that free trade is good for every body in the world … but it’s hard to make that argument when somebody loses their job.R&B: You are not going to tell someone who loses their job that macro-economic forces caused this.

BC: That’s right. So I do think that Donald Trump has tapped into a frustration of working class America, so I think he is doing well with private sector, union voters out there. I think he is going to continue to. I think it’s probably a reality of our Republican Party that we are going to need to reach out to those voters.I tell everybody. The only way to win a election is to have a majority. And it’s hard to put your Christian Republicans together and come up with a majority of the country. Obama has demonstrated that in the last two elections. Now with the new group of voters we have I think we will have a majority. But, it’s going to include working class America as a part of it. I think there is a new constituent group in the Republican Party, and we have to recognize that.R&B: To close, can you elaborate a little more on your experience as a delegate, and what other things delegates do, besides what we see with the roll call vote on the floor?BC: Well, I’ll tell you what my job has been with this delegation. I’m just trying to bring everybody together. I have a good friend of mine Jason right here. We have both worked and supported Marco Rubio in the presidential election. Jason, me and other members of the delegation realize it’s our job to unify. So that’s what I try to work hard to do. ‘Is everybody there? 100 percent?’ We’re not 100 percent. I can tell you the state of Georgia is probably 95 percent there. I hope by the end of this convention, we can get up to 100 percent.",Alex Vanden Heuvel @vanderhueves,athensnews,https://www.redandblack.com/athensnews/georgia-delegate-offers-insight-into-role-of-delegation-at-republican/article_ed195e28-5030-11e6-8aba-f7cdf7147289.html

11-Aug-16,Linebacker Tim Kimbrough confirms he will transfer from Georgia,"Senior linebacker Tim Kimbrough took to Twitter Thursday morning to confirm that he will be leaving the Georgia football program. Head coach Kirby Smart released a statement regarding the decision on Thursday afternoon.“Based on a mutual decision between Tim (Kimbrough) and I, he will no longer be a part of our football program,"" Smart said. ""We wish him the best as he continues his education and playing career.”Kimbrough was absent at Wednesday’s practice, and afterward Smart said the Indianapolis-native was taking “a little leave of absence right now” from the team. Smart declined to comment further on Wednesday, but Kimbrough confirmed the news on his own.


 


“I have to go to a D2 school so I can play this year. I’m not sitting out this year,” Kimbrough tweeted. “I didn’t have a choice to stay at Georgia.”Kimbrough then indicated a possible issue with the Georgia coaching staff. Over his four years at Georgia, Kimbrough has played for four different position coaches: Kirk Olivadotti (2013), Mike Ekeler (2014-2015), Kevin Sherrer (for the TaxSlayer Bowl after Ekeler took a job at North Texas) and now, Glenn Schumann.“I had 4 different sets of coaches while I was there and I was good with each coaching staff,” Kimbrough tweeted. “Idk [I don’t know] what happened this year.”Kimbrough started seven games last season and totaled 67 tackles, which was third-best on the team. He then missed the TaxSlayer Bowl because of a suspension for undisclosed reasons, and missed time during spring practice due to academic issues. Kimbrough’s father, Tim Kimbrough Sr., told the Athens-Banner Herald that the transfer is not due to academics.Entering this season, he was the leading-returning tackler at linebacker. However, Kimbrough was practicing with the second-team defense during preseason practices behind junior Reggie Carter and sophomore Natrez Patrick. His decision to transfer leaves Carter as the most experienced linebacker, even though he only played in one game last season because of a shoulder injury.

12-Aug-16,Community outreach by police credited for decline in summer burglaries,"When thousands of students fled from the area for summer break, Athens noticed a decrease in burglaries over the past three months.While nationally burglaries tend to spike during the summer, Athens was an exception to the trend.According to Athens-Clarke County police reports, there have been a total of 77 break-ins in the university area since May as of press time.


 


Captain Mark Sizemore with the Athens-Clarke County Police Department credits the relatively-low number to the agency’s combined efforts to educate the youth of Athens and the temporary decline in population.On Saturday, August 6th, ACCPD officers participated in the Bethel Back To School celebration along with Bethel... https://t.co/Us7C6oP0TY— Athens-Clarke Police (@accpolice) August 9, 2016“When there’s less traffic, we will generally have a reduction in the crime that we have,” Sizemore said.  Sizemore said the ACCPD’s efforts to educate the public and the youth of Athens by way of summer programs has also helped improve responsible citizenship within the community while creating trust between youth and police officers. “We want to build relationships with the young people in our community and enforce positive relationships with law enforcement,” he said. “We even took a couple of groups down to the University of Georgia to really show and educate them.”Now that students have returned to Athens for the new school year, Deputy Chief Justin Gregory reminds students, new and old, to remain smart about securing belongings. “I really want those who are coming to Athens to focus on and take responsibility for their own safety,” he said. “We will be there for them, and while Athens is a safe community, things do happen.”


 


Both Gregory and Sizemore said it is easier and more likely that a student’s car will be broken into rather than their apartment.“Take care of your property, and don’t leave things in cars. We deal with a lot of victimization that way,” Gregory said.

“A lot of the incidents we have is where suspects will just walk up to a car, open the door and get in,” Sizemore said. “That is one of the things we want to get across to students from small towns or elsewhere, that it may be okay wherever they’re from, but there are a lot of students here and a lot of opportunity for things to happen.”Simple tasks like locking the car and hiding valuables from being in the open, Gregory said, can help students avoid being victims of break-ins. “We remove a lot of crime by not creating opportunity,” said Gregory.","Charlotte Norsworthy

12-Aug-16,Georgia baseball's recruiting class ranked No. 4 in nation,"After a rocky 27-30 season this spring, Georgia baseball has nowhere to go but up. According to Perfect Game USA, the team will be moving in that direction sooner rather than later.PG recently rated Georgia’s 2016 recruiting class at No. 4 in the nation. The incoming Bulldogs trail only North Carolina, Ole Miss and Arizona State. Four members of the group were among the top 100 recruits nationally, and all of them are ranked in the top 500.“We’re excited about this group; they are a difference-making class,” head coach Scott Stricklin said. “It’s deep at every position and features great baseball players and great athletes.”


 


The quality of Stricklin’s recruiting has improved consistently over the past three seasons, going from No. 26 two classes ago all the way into the top five this year. Three of this year’s newcomers chose Georgia’s team over playing professionally. Pitcher’s Justin Glover and Zac Kristofak as well as shortstop Cam Shepherd were all selected in the MLB draft this June. Many of the other 18 members of UGA’s 2016 recruiting class were looked at by major league teams but were passed over because of their commitment to Georgia.The No. 4 ranking given to the class does not factor in junior college transfers, so the Bulldogs earned it without the inclusion of NCJAA All-American Will Campbell who batted .425 and knocked in 83 RBIs last season at Chattahoochee Valley Community College last season. The college baseball season is still months away, and the team is far from completely fixed. But for a program that went 11-19 in SEC play in 2016, it’s at least a start.","Nathan Berg

12-Aug-16,Health center celebrates local community services,"From Aug. 7 to Aug. 13, National Health Center Week is celebrating America’s health centers and their contributions to community health.Each day of the week honors a specific area of health center goals “that will allow for more opportunities to showcase the innovative services and programs at Health Centers,” according to the NHCW website. The Athens Neighborhood Health Center is one of 1,375 locations in the country that serves local communities.


 


Every year for NHCW, the center holds an open house to inform the community about its efforts to provide comprehensive primary healthcare to citizens with lower income.The health center serves approximately 10,000 citizens as patients, according to the health center’s health plan navigator Harold Weber.“The concept we use is called patient-centered medical home,” he said.The center provides for its patients at their three locations and pharmacy and hopes to expand in size and in its  services, such as incorporating dentistry, Weber said. Expansion began in 2012 when the center became federally qualified for funding and continued in its addition of a pharmacy.  “That’s the real message,” Weber said. “If you’re a patient, you’re going to get your medication for a tenth or even less of what you pay in a lot of retail locations.”Two months ago, the center purchased an x-ray machine for its westside location. With it, the center aims to add affordable x-rays to its readily available services, according to Weber.The University Health Center at the University of Georgia is not participating in NHCW in order to prepare its services for incoming students, according to the center’s senior public relations coordinator Kristine Groft.


 


“We strive to positively impact all aspects of our campus community’s physical, social and emotional health,” she said. “Our recent award for the highest recognition for healthcare organizations, accreditation for all services by the joint commission, speaks to our ongoing commitment to UGA students.”Beyond NHCW, both facilities strive to provide affordable care for the Athens-Clarke County community.","Savannah Peat

13-Aug-16,Nick Chubb tackled for 1st time since injury during preseason scrimmage,"Part of recovering from an injury is overcoming the psychological tentativeness to do what led to the injury in the first place.For Georgia running back Nick Chubb, that psychological hurdle is being tackled. Chubb tore multiple ligaments in his knee in a loss to Tennessee last season when he was tackled out-of-bounds on the first play from scrimmage.At Georgia’s first scrimmage of the preseason on Saturday, head coach Kirby Smart said the star tailback was purposefully tackled for the first time this preseason.


 


“He got tackled and did well with it,” Smart said. “It was important to him to get over that psychologically, but also the physical conditioning part of getting up and down off the ground.”Smart said Chubb performed well with the “seven or eight” carries that the junior received. Chubb broke tackles in those runs, but Smart partially attributed that to poor tackling by the defense and officials who were quick to blow the whistle.“I think the officials were more worried about it than we were because they were trying to blow the whistle quick, and we didn't want that,” Smart said.Chubb has occasionally been to the ground during preseason practices so far, but Saturday’s scrimmage was the first time he was purposely tackled. At this point, there has been no word on whether or not Chubb will be ready for the first game on Sept. 3.Chubb’s counterpart, Sony Michel, was seen during the media’s viewing portion at the start of practice without protection of any kind on his injured left forearm. Through practices so far, Michel has had a protective cast on the forearm as he recovers from an open fracture suffered in an ATV accident on July 3. However, Smart said Michel’s lack of forearm protection was simply because Michel wouldn’t be participating during the scrimmage.","Wilson Alexander

13-Aug-16,Search committee established to find replacement dean for School of Public and International Affairs,"In search of a new dean for the University of Georgia's School of Public and International Affairs, Senior Vice President for Academic Affairs and Provost Pamela Whitten has appointed a committee to search nationally for qualified individuals.According to a press release, the 19-person committee includes professors, alumni and students and is chaired by the dean of Grady College of Journalism and Mass Communications, Charles N. Davis.“I was honored to be asked to join the search committee and am very glad that Provost Whitten arranged for such a broad range of stakeholders to be represented,” said SPIA academic adviser and committee member Kevin James.


 


The UGA Search Group in Human Resources is assisting the search committee, which had their first private meeting Friday, according to committee member and Richard B. Russell Chair in political science Charles S. Bullock III.The committee will first draft an advertisement for the position with a closing date of a few months from the start of the search. They intend to have a short list of 10 candidates by the end of the semester, Bullock said.After phone interviews, Bullock expects three or four individuals will make it to the in-person interviews.“The goal will be to have the new dean ready to take over next summer or the beginning of the fall semester of 2017 at the latest,” he said.Robert Grafstein, interim SPIA dean and Georgia Athletic Association professor, does not intend on holding the position permanently, according to the press release.“The hope is to have the permanent dean in place as soon as possible,"" Grafstein said. ""It’s a great opportunity to keep the school on its impressive trajectory.""Former SPIA Dean Stefanie Lindquist begins her new position as deputy provost, vice president for academic affairs and Foundation Professor of Law and Political Science at Arizona State University on Sept. 1, according to the press release.","Savannah Peat

14-Aug-16,"'Pokemon Go' promotes physical fitness with pleasure, researcher says","As the ""Pokemon Go"" app sweeps the nation, players of all ages are motivated to go outside and literally ""catch 'em all.""""Pokemon Go"" player Sera Thomas, a sophomore finance and real estate major from Atlanta, finds the augmented reality game is not only fun but supports a healthy lifestyle.“I think it encourages people to exercise without telling them to go to the gym or do anything daunting,” she said.


 


The mobile game requires a user, or trainer, to travel to various locations and accomplish tasks, such as visiting a ""PokeStop"" to restock on supplies, or walk a certain amount to incubate eggs. Matt Hoffman, a clinical assistant professor at the Health Science Center at Texas A&M University, said the benefits of these tasks make the users feel successful in the game, which parallel the success they feel after accomplishing a physical task.“It’s essentially an internal positive feedback loop,” Hoffman said. “Not to mention, increased physical activity naturally increases endorphins known to enhance and improve mood, thus adding to the user’s motivation.”Since Pokemon Go is advertised as a game, its fitness motivations are disguised more so than with fitness tracking applications such as Fitbit, he said.“Fitbit does provide methods for motivating users,” Hoffman said. “But they’re not as effective and memorable as those found within Pokemon Go.”While Fitbit users can share their goals with friends and family, Pokemon Go users can evolve their Pokemon creatures or battle with a rival.“Whether intentional or not, the creators and developers have delivered a game that has tapped into the pleasure and reward center in our brain, while simultaneously triggering nostalgia in the users that grew up playing Pokemon cards or video games,” Hoffman said.This nostalgia resonates strongly with many users, including Nikolaus Calia, who has been a fan of Pokemon since Pokemon Sapphire was released when he was seven years old.“I think that we won’t see the long-term effects for quite a while, but I do think eventually this app is going to make everyone much fitter,” said Calia, a sophomore mechanical engineering major from Dunwoody.


 


Hoffman warns, however, that this positive feedback loop will not last forever. “Over time, the more we reinforce this pathway with specific pleasurable behaviors or activities, the more difficult it becomes to achieve a pleasurable or gratifying response within our brain,” he said.Hoffman said as players reach a plateau in the game and are unable to achieve what feels more rewarding than what they have already achieved, they will begin to feel frustrated. As such, Hoffman said he could imagine players becoming addicted, and developers struggling to continue satisfying players.","Mia Falcon

17-Aug-16,Georgia football looking to use surplus of tall wide receivers,"Receivers come in all different shapes and sizes.There are quick, shifty receivers that operate out of the slot. Some players are best suited for a blocking role. Then there are those players that possess the perfect combination of speed, size and hands.Some of the most important types of receivers are the big, physical targets for quarterbacks to look to when they need a big play over the middle or a fade route run in the end zone. Quarterbacks can just throw the ball up and have faith their receiver can go get it.


 


For the past several years, Georgia hasn’t had a surplus of these types of receivers. The only one that would really fit the mold would be Chris Conley, who graduated after the 2014 season. While the lack of big receivers certainly can’t explain all of Georgia’s offensive troubles over the past couple years, it definitely didn’t help matters either.

This season, however, large targets will be plentiful for whoever Georgia trots out at quarterback.The Bulldogs have four projected contributors at receiver who are six-foot-two or taller: freshman Riley Ridley, sophomores Michael Chigbu and Jayson Stanley, and junior graduate transfer Javon Wims.After seeing the ups and downs of the offense for the past three seasons, senior offensive lineman Greg Pyke is excited about the stable of Clydesdales Georgia has at its disposal.“I think they’re doing a great job,” Pyke said. “Coach Chaney’s put them in a great position to make plays out there. Anyone that we have out there, I think we have plenty of playmakers to make those plays.”As a self-proclaimed “jack of all trades,"" Chigbu takes pride in being ready for whatever may be thrown his way.“You never know what situations you’re going to be put in,” Chigbu said. “It might be the smallest person, but you might have to go block the biggest guy. You never know what will happen.”

Chigbu mentioned a skill that often gets overlooked when it comes to receivers: blocking. Large receivers aren’t just a bonus to teams through the air. They are also often very effective in using their big bodies in blocking cornerbacks and coming inside to block linebackers.“It’s exciting,” Pyke said. “One of the plays we always run is trying to get those guys to come in and chip those linebackers, so we can get one of the bigger guys out front for one of the wonderful backs we have back there.”Pyke added that having physical receivers on the outside is a big help to the offensive linemen, since more big bodies on the field equals more effective blockers.While players like this can certainly help an offense, they aren’t the breaking point of an offense’s success. Teams can be very effective on offense without a big target on the outside; just ask Tom Brady. As for his approach to helping his team, Chigbu has a simple one.“We’ve got to make plays and change the game,” Chigbu said. “That’s our motto, change the game.”","Jed May

18-Aug-16,EDITORIAL: UGA's new football ticket policy prioritizes cash over students,"After last year’s football ticket fiasco, in which nearly 20 percent of students who applied for the home game season ticket package were only awarded tickets for six of the seven home games, the Student Government Association and the Athletic Board of Directors decided to enact more permanent changes to student ticketing policies.These changes include placing a ban on direct student-to-student ticket donations and reducing the number of strikes a student may receive before losing ticket privileges from three to two. While these changes may have been implemented with the hope of ensuring a more fair ticketing process, the general feeling among students this fall is annoyance at the Athletic Department for failing to understand the biggest problem with the student ticketing system — it prioritizes cash over students.For some reason, I thought each year it would be easier to get UGA student football tickets......— It'sJustBrad (@nothingbutbrad) August 10, 2016


 


In the past, student ticket holders who could not attend any one of the allotted football games on the schedule could easily sell their ticket for its face value of $7. This year, however, students cannot do so because of the ban on direct donations.Although it was instituted as a result of the outrageous prices students were charging one another for tickets to last season’s Alabama and South Carolina games, this ban is unfair. Student ticket holders should have the right to sell any individual ticket that belongs to them for as much as someone is willing to pay.Year 6 of requesting UGA Student Football Tickets. Year 6 of it going off with no less than 52948 hitches. Go dawgs. Go @UGAAthletics.— Rachel Corman (@ra_corman) August 9, 2016These tickets were purchased, after all, from the Athletics Department at the price the department found fair. Why, then, can students not sell tickets to others at fair market prices after purchase? This is a right retained by non-student ticket holders. More than just a simple limit on student money-making opportunities, this ban is especially troubling for seniors who likely will rely on the donation system to gain admittance to home games that prioritize freshmen.No longer are upperclassmen guaranteed a last Saturday between the hedges. Instead, their final opportunity to cheer on the Bulldogs may fall at complete random. The claim that these policies were created to help students may be true, but the university cannot deny that other, more student-focused solutions exist.The general feeling among students this fall is annoyance at the Athletic Department for failing to understand the biggest problem with the student ticketing system—it prioritizes cash over students.


 


Previous policy changes have included cutting student seats at games from 18,026 to 16,200 after roughly 30 percent of student ticketholders failed to appear at home games in 2014. If the problem is that there are not enough seats for students who are desperate to attend games, why would the university not expand the student section to its original size to accommodate the people who make playing possible through our funds, our support and, for student athletes, our blood, sweat and tears?",Kelcey Caulder @kelceycaulder,opinion,https://www.redandblack.com/opinion/editorial-uga-s-new-football-ticket-policy-prioritizes-cash-over/article_6d25725e-6437-11e6-a26b-97247737c738.html
20-Aug-16,Georgia field goal team has trouble in Saturday's scrimmage,"To use the title of a Keith Whitley song, the Georgia Bulldogs were no stranger to the rain last season.Four games were affected by wet conditions last season. Contests against the University of Louisiana-Monroe, Southern University, Alabama and Kentucky all had to deal with varying shades of precipitation. The Louisiana-Monroe game ended up being cut short due to lightning in the area in the second half.Over the past week, Athens has been bombarded by heavy rain showers. Thursday’s practice was halted a little over 30 minutes in. 


 


The second fall scrimmage on Saturday was no different.“We had lightning in the area, got a good rain,” head coach Kirby Smart said. “We didn’t have lightning early, so we got a lot of wet ball practice in warmups and in the first part of the scrimmage. Then we had lightning, so we had to shut it down for a little bit and then go back out. It’s almost like coming out after a half a little bit, so that was good to get used to that.”While Smart said the weather was “frustrating”, it wasn’t without its positive benefits. Smart said it was good for his team to practice in the rain, saying that it’s important for them to get used to playing in conditions that are less than ideal.With the weather being what it was, it was clear there would be some effect on the scrimmage. According to Smart, it was the third phase of the game that struggled the most. “After the delay, the special teams went downhill and got sloppy,” Smart said. “Wet ball, guys dropping stuff, a couple bad snaps. It was rough after it rained, so that was a little disappointing.”Smart said there was one special teams unit in particular that had trouble with the rain.It just happens to be the most uncertain special teams group on the team.“I would say more of the field goal game,” Smart said. “It was wet and sloppy and really hard to snap. We got most of our punting in prior to the rain, so the punt and punt return game was fine. Kickoff and kickoff return looked fine. It was more of the field goals and PATs with the sloppiness out there being wet and all.” 


 


Ordinarily, this would just mean it was a tough day for Georgia’s kickers. But this is no ordinary fall camp for this group.Redshirt freshman Rodrigo Blankenship and redshirt sophomore William Ham have been duking it out for the starting kicker job all spring and summer. With the season a mere two weeks away, the kicking battle still has not been resolved. Judging by what was said about Saturday’s scrimmage, it doesn’t appear that any progress was made towards naming a starter for the season opener against North Carolina.Smart has said that he wants to make decisions about his key position battles in the coming days. Now, Mother Nature just needs to cooperate.","Jed May

20-Aug-16,Kirby Smart comments on Georgia running backs after Saturday scrimmage,"Georgia’s running backs were already a major storyline heading into fall camp. Nick Chubb was working to rehab from his catastrophic knee injury suffered against Tennessee last October. There were two new freshmen in Brian Herrien and Elijah Holyfield. Then Sony Michel flipped an ATV and fractured his forearm. 


 


The Bulldog backfield was suddenly in disarray. Chubb passed a major hurdle last week when he was tackled for the first time since his injury. In the second scrimmage of the preseason on Saturday, head coach Kirby Smart said Chubb looked very good in a practice that was dampened by rain showers.“He’s doing a good job,” Smart said. “It was wet out there. It’s tough to have a lot of speed and burst in that environment. But a lot of times it’s not the fastest guy, but the guy that can stay on balance and body control.”With regards to Chubb’s availability in the season opener on Sept. 3, Smart said earlier this week that “it’s pointing in that direction."" While Chubb looks better and better to play against North Carolina to start the season, Michel’s outlook is not quite as positive. He has been wearing a cast around his fractured left forearm, and he has been wearing a non-contact jersey in practice.“It’s one of those deals where it’s a medical decision right now,” Smart said. “They’re trying to decide when it’s safe for him to go back and do things. The biggest thing for him is going to be ball security.”While Michel hasn’t been experiencing contact in practice, he hasn’t been sitting out entirely. He has been participating in 7-on-7 drills, which Smart called “an upgrade."" “There probably is a date that we would say we need to know something by, but it’s not like Sony hasn’t played football,” Smart said. If one or both of Georgia’s top two backs aren’t ready to go, there are capable players ready to step up behind them. Senior Brendan Douglas stands in line to start if both Chubb and Michel are unavailable, and redshirt freshman Tae Crowder could get some touches as well.


 


There are also the two talented freshmen. Smart said Herrien performed well in Saturday’s scrimmage, and praised him for his strong performance. With the season opener just two weeks away, the running back situation is coming more and more into focus. At this point in camp, it seems Chubb is more likely to play week one than Michel.","Jed May

20-Aug-16,UGA HOME hosts 5K 'water run' to raise awareness for homelessness,"As it enters its second year at the University of Georgia, the student organization UGA HOME hosted a 5-kilometer ""water run"" Saturday morning to raise funds and awareness for homelessness in Athens.All along the course, which began at Stegeman Coliseum, runners were soaked by volunteers with water guns.


 


According to the UGA HOME organization, the proceeds from the $15 registration fee will go to funding a scholarship for a homeless youth to attend college this upcoming year. Beyond the scholarship, Aditya Sood, the co-founder of the nonprofit organization Working Together for Change, of which UGA HOME is a chapter, said he hopes the race will raise awareness for homelessness in Athens and get more people involved with the group’s future activities.Sood, a sophomore biology and sociology major from Alpharetta, founded the organization during his sophomore year of high school with the aim of raising awareness for and ultimately eliminating homelessness.“A bunch of friends and I decided that we wanted to do something about what we were seeing in downtown Athens,” he said. “Athens is a place that we like to call home and we don’t like to see the problems we have at home ignored.”The Working Together for Change organization has several high school and university chapters across the country, which Sood said operate on the same general set of goals, carrying out events to fund scholarships and medical care for the homeless, as well as other programs such as mass donations and services to assist in resume building for homeless individuals.“Most people don’t know that the average homeless individual is someone under the age of 18,” Sood said. “We want to foster connections [between the public and the homeless]. We can remove the stigma.""","Pete Prybylski

21-Aug-16,Kirby Smart searching for 2 more game-ready inside linebackers,"As head coach Kirby Smart sees it, Georgia’s football team has three inside linebackers ready to play. However, Smart doesn’t think that’s enough.“We're trying to find five guys who can play at that position,” Smart said on Saturday. “We're comfortable with three.”The three Smart is referring to are junior Reggie Carter, sophomore Natrez Patrick and sophomore Roquan Smith. There was a fourth in senior Tim Kimbrough, but he decided to transfer from the program.


 


With Kimbrough’s transfer, Carter, who has started one game in his career, is providing leadership for the group, according to outside linebacker Chuks Amaechi. Patrick and Smith bring the energy.“Roquan is somebody who we're going to have to go out there and match his intensity,” junior outside linebacker Davin Bellamy said. “That guy, he flies around. Natrez is the same way. He [Patrick] doesn't shy away from anybody.”During practices this week, those two sophomores were seen practicing at first-team linebacker, with Carter and converted-safety Rashad Roundtree going with the second-team.Until Kimbrough transferred, Roundtree had been at safety. After Kimbrough’s decision, Smart said the team would maybe look to move a player to linebacker. Enter Roundtree.The 6-foot-1, 204-pound, Evans native recorded six tackles in 12 games last season, mostly on special teams. This preseason, the sophomore was buried on the depth chart at safety behind Quincy Mauger and Dominick Sanders. Roundtree wasn’t guaranteed a spot as a back-up safety, and was competing with multiple players for back-up snaps.“He looked pretty good (with the linebackers),” junior safety Dominick Sanders said. “He’s a bigger body as a DB. He was one of the big guys back there. But being a linebacker is something he’s got to adjust to. But he’ll improve on that because every day he’ll be spending time learning how to play linebacker. He’s a big, physical guy and I think that position could be meant for him.”In addition to Roundtree, Smart also mentioned Juwan Taylor as a guy who is playing well. Taylor, a sophomore, played in nine games last season, recording seven tackles.If Roundtree and Taylor can progress more, Georgia would have the five linebackers that Smart wants ready to play. In college football, Smart thinks it’s a necessity.


 


“It's a tough position,” Smart said. “I don't think I've ever gone a season that all three top inside linebackers were able to sustain without bumps and bruises.”","Wilson Alexander

21-Aug-16,Georgia football ranked No. 18 in preseason AP poll,"The preseason AP poll was released on Sunday, and Georgia finds itself ranked at No. 18. The Bulldogs received 448 total points to land behind Iowa and in front of Louisville.In total, there are six SEC teams ranked in the poll. Alabama is No. 1, LSU is No. 5, Tennessee is No. 9, Ole Miss is No. 11 and Florida is No. 25.

22-Aug-16,Georgia State Patrol concludes investigation into fatal crash that killed 4 UGA students,"The Georgia State Patrol has completed its investigation into the the car crash on Highway 15 in April that killed four University of Georgia students.According to a media spokesperson with the Georgia State Patrol Public Information Office, the Georgia State Patrol's Troop B Specialized Collision Reconstruction Team concluded its investigation and presented its findings on August 4 to the Western Judicial Circuit District Attorney Office, where district attorney Ken Mauldin is examining the report to determine if the case should be presented to a grand jury.Mauldin said although the incident involved university students, it does not change the legal procedure.


 


""This is no different that any other matter where there's a traffic accident and a death involved,"" Mauldin said. ""We're not doing anything special for this particular case.""The district attorney said there is ""no exact timeline"" for his review, but he does not ""anticipate it taking too long.""""Maybe the next couple weeks,"" he said.According to an initial report released from the Georgia Department of Public Safety a few days following the accident, there was ""no indication of any substance and no person involved had any signs of any impairing substances located at the scene or in any of the vehicles involved."" Analysis for sensor equipment in both vehicles showed no reports of speeding.The crash, which occurred the night of April 27 on Highway 15 south of Athens in Oconee County, involved a head-on collision between two vehicles. According to investigation reports released by the Department of Public Safety, the incident occurred around 9 p.m. when the car driven by Agnes Kim, a 21-year-old UGA student, and carrying four other UGA students, veered into the opposite lane and struck another car, driven by 27-year-old Abby Short.Investigators arrived to find 19-year-old Kayla Canedo, 20-year-old Brittany Feldman and 19-year-old Christina Semeria dead at the scene. Halle Scott, a 19-year-old, was transported to Athens Regional Medical Center, where she later died.Kim was also transported to Athens Regional, where she was in a coma until the end of May. She undergoes daily occupational, speech and physical therapy at the Shepherd Center, according to a post on YouCaring.com, a previous Red & Black article reported.Abby Short was transported to Athens Regional for injuries, where she was later released.

22-Aug-16,UGA finishes 2016 Olympic Games with 10 medals,"The University of Georgia is not a country. But if it was an independent nation, it would rank fairly high on the worldwide medal count now that the 2016 Olympic Games have concluded.Athletes with ties to Georgia earned 10 medals at the Rio Games, which positions the hypothetical nation of UGA tied for 27th in the count based on overall medals. Based on number of golds, Georgia ties for 17th. Since almost all of Georgia’s medals came from the swimming events, which took place at the beginning of the Olympic schedule, the university ranked much higher earlier in August.


 


Even though Georgia was well represented at track and field events in Rio, the university’s only top-three finish came from former Bulldog Shaunae Miller with her gold in the 400-meter. The other nine medals for Georgia were a product of its swimming program.Former Georgia swimmer Allison Schmitt was the only Bulldog to earn two medals, as she won gold in the women’s 4x200-meter freestyle relay and silver in the 4x100 freestyle relay. Three other swimmers — Melanie Margalis, Olivia Smoliga and Gunnar Bentz — also finished the Games with a gold.Keep in mind, the medals of each relay finisher count as one individual medal for the athlete. However, the worldwide medal tally only accounts for one combined medal for team performances. Therefore, when multiple Bulldogs race on the same relay team, Georgia’s medal count increases by the number of athletes on the team who medaled, but the country total only increases by one. The medals earned by Georgia athletes were not deducted from their respective country’s total.University of Georgia’s overall medal count finished on par with countries such as Croatia, South Africa and Czech Republic. Bulldog Nation, however, is not recognized as a country on the world map.All athletes with ties to Georgia who earned a medal:

24-Aug-16,OPINION: The student argument for big business in Athens,"It seems that every time downtown Athens welcomes a new chain venue or the University of Georgia expands eateries to suit the masses, the community divides further on the decision to bring in new businesses.The argument lies in the desire to keep Athens home to its local shops, ones that support small business owners and give this town the authentic feel we have grown accustomed to. While some feel that our picturesque town is being bulldozed over to make way for the needs of millennials, we are undeniably planting ourselves in the past if the future of Athens resides in small town businesses.When Urban Outfitters opened its doors last August, individuals were either for or against its somewhat out of place presence on East Clayton street. Though it arguably changed the aesthetic appeal of downtown, it also generated jobs for individuals in the surrounding area, and while we could argue that the store took away business revenue from surrounding local shops, we couldn’t deny that it is catering to a large portion of Athens inhabitants — students that want higher-end, trend-setting clothing available to them at a convenient location. Stores must cater to different clientele and in Athens that customer base is quite varied.


 


With a new Starbucks and Caribou Coffee set to arrive on the University of Georgia campus this year, students and the surrounding community are once again debating the merits of bringing in new businesses and how doing so will affect locally owned companies like Jittery Joe’s. I say bring on the competition.While the opening of these new coffee shops may overlap with Jittery Joe’s established customer base, it brings new job opportunities to the community, just as the opening of Urban Outfitters did. In addition to these job openings, they will provide a convenience and availability that students want on campus. We don’t want to wait in lines that wrap around the Miller Learning Center. We want to be able to have more options and less wait times. If we continue to worry about the takeover of locally owned businesses such as Jittery Joe’s, we will find ourselves just as frustrated enduring long lines for that iced chai latte.It is no surprise that UGA and the city of Athens work to satisfy students. The city has become so dependent on our business that they must bring in the sort of things we want to see — like an Urban Outfitters or a Starbucks. Perhaps unfortunately for Athens, students are constantly moving and benefit from the convenience of greater options, even if these options might change the aesthetic of our town.We cannot continue to believe that as years go by Athens will stay deeply rooted in small business. Business works to satisfy its consumer base, and a majority of that customer base in Athens is made up of the upwards of 30,000 students that attend this university. Business owners are only being smart by tapping into new markets. Out of the mass of students attending UGA, many of them will drink coffee whether it’s locally owned or a corporate chain. Coffee is coffee when you’ve only got five minutes to get to your next lecture. The majority of students are simply less concerned about the feelings of small town business owners and more concerned about how quickly they can get their espresso.","Cassie Daigle

25-Aug-16,A climate of discrimination: UGA campus survey reveals 'exclusionary and hostile' conduct,"For Jazmine Avery, a senior psychology major from Marietta, the fact that she is a minority is something she is reminded of on a daily basis when she goes to class.“Often times I’m one or one of a few people of color in a classroom in most of the classes that I go to,” she said.In an effort to acknowledge the issues facing biracial students, Avery, who is half-black and half-Asian, created her own student organization in 2013, the Multiracial Student Organization.


 


“I started [the organization] my freshman year in order to start a space for multiracial and multicultural students,” she said.‘Racism and homophobia’In order to address issues of campus inclusiveness from the perspective of the administration, the University of Georgia looked to give a voice to students, faculty and staff by conducting the Count Me In Survey in the fall of 2015.“The survey was really an attempt on the part of the University of Georgia to hear the voices and to learn more about the experiences of faculty, staff and students here at the University of Georgia,” said Michelle Cook, associate provost for Institutional Diversity, who chaired the 11-member committee that oversaw the survey.The results were released in July, with an overall response rate of 23 percent, or just more than 10,000 people, according to the executive summary. This was below the target goal of 30 percent, which Cook said was needed for the survey results to be generalized for the entire university population.According to the results, 81 percent of respondents were “comfortable” or “very comfortable” with the campus climate at UGA. However, the results also revealed discriminatory themes across the campus.“Two themes emerged from narratives provided in this data: discrimination and hostile work environment. Students described discrimination in the form of racism and homophobia,” according to the executive summary.In the survey results, 16 percent of respondents said they experienced “exclusionary, intimidating, offensive, and/or hostile conduct.” The results also found that these experiences varied based on the group of constituents. Twenty-six percent of respondents felt the behavior they experienced was based on gender or gender identity, another 23 percent felt it was based on ethnicity, and 19 percent felt it was based on racial identity.


 


Campus Climate SurveyCreate bar chartsThe scale of this graph is in percentages. Avery agrees there is discrimination on campus, but rarely is it overt.“It’s not like anyone’s coming up to all of the black students or all of the Hispanic students and being like ‘You’re not welcome here.’ It’s more just a lot of those subtle undercurrent type things,” she said. “The best way I can put it is ‘This is not not for you, but it’s just for somebody else.’”Felix Linzan, a senior from Hinesville studying business management, first encountered discrimination when he was a freshman.“I was at Park Hall and was on the phone. I’m Latino, and I was speaking Spanish to my grandmother because she only speaks Spanish,” Linzan said. “There was a group of girls who were in a sorority and they proceeded to mumble something within their group, something about ‘This is America, you don’t need to be speaking Spanish around here. Speak English.’”Those in the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community at the university also reported feeling prejudice. Avery, who said she is “not straight,” mentioned times when she has felt oppressed.

“I’ve had professors talk to female students [about] ‘Your boyfriend when you get older,’ but for me personally, my immediate thought was ‘I get the point you’re trying to make, but it would have been nice if you’d just said spouse or partner or something where you don’t have to single out anybody,’” she said. “It’s just learning how to make the body more inclusive, appealing and open to everybody.”To combat prejudice against the LGBT community, specifically against transgender students, a new statewide program is attempting to bring attention to the issue.The Georgia Transgender Student Rights Watch, launched by five LGBT advocacy groups, plans to monitor discrimination against transgender and gender non-conforming groups students from elementary school to college. The organization allows students and parents to report their experiences with discrimination to a website.“From the use of declared names and pronouns, to restrooms, locker rooms, sports, uniforms, and extracurricular activities, school districts should respect the gender identity of all students, including transgender students. No student should ever have to go through the experience of feeling unwelcome at school or on a college campus,” according to a press release from the organization. Despite both being present on campus, discrimination based on racial identity and sexual identity are often mutually exclusive. Avery said some students who identify as LGBT still experience racial discrimination from their peers within the LGBT community.“A lot of times when it comes to LGBT stuff, even LGBT people of color experience discrimination from gay white guys,” she said. Push for a solutionGoing forward, Pamela Whitten, the senior vice president for Academic Affairs and Provost, plans to lead a series of student, faculty and staff working groups representing Human Resources, the Division of Student Affairs, the Office of Institutional Diversity and the Office of Faculty Affairs in response to the results of the survey.

“International Student Life, Multicultural Services and Programs and the LGBT Resource Center all have really good initiatives to help push forward what the administration is doing,” Linzan said. “A lot of times when it comes to LGBT stuff, even LGBT people of color experience discrimination from gay white guys.""-Jazmine Avery, student Linzan said a mandatory course in diversity would be a good starting point for the administration.

“There is the online alcohol course for all incoming students, which is a mandatory thing,” he said. “Something like that for a social justice course, just so everyone knows that everyone is different, and to be respectful of different perspectives, I feel like that’d be a good push toward what the administration should go to.”Nia Hammer, a sophomore math major from McDonough and the treasurer of the Multiracial Student Organization, said she would like to see the university promote more multicultural programs.“The people that are interested in it right now are going to be the ones who are willing to go to the different multi-cultural functions, but those aren’t the people who are prejudiced,” she said.Avery said organizations like the MSO are “helping to combat part of the problem.”“We’ve had people come up to us and be like ‘Wow, we really like what you guys are doing and I want to have other people that I can relate to,’” she said. “We do have a lot of people that come up to us and say “I really needed this” or ‘This is something I felt like was missing from my campus experience.’”As a fourth year, Linzan said he has witnessed the involvement of administration in addressing issues of campus inclusiveness. He was specifically impressed with the outreach done by Arthur Tripp Jr, the assistant to President Jere Morehead.“Arthur Tripp did a great job last year going out with different organizations, and getting himself out there,” he said. “I was a Resident Assistant last year, and we went around to housing with President Morehead just to see what’s going on and get our feedback on what they can do to help us and any concerns within our jobs or within the campus itself. I think that was really good on their part.”

Cook said the university is looking to not only maintain the services it currently offers, but to improve them.“We want to make sure that we continue to offer those services and supports for the community that people are using and finding very effective,” she said. “We definitely want to build on those strengths as we look to see where there might be gaps.” At the same time, Avery said a lot of change in the community is going to rely on the students.“I think we’re helping with part of the problem, but it won’t really take just one organization or group to do that kind of thing,” she said. “I think it’s definitely way more about our collective experience and using all of our power as students to use what we learn and apply that to our lives.”","Melanie Fincher

25-Aug-16,"'Meet the Greeks': National Pan-Hellenic Council emphasizes community, unity","Kirk Bailey, along with dozens of other students, sat in the Zell B. Miller Learning Center as the six University of Georgia chapters of the National Pan-Hellenic Council hosted an introductory event Aug. 22 for those interested in pursuing Greek Life on campus.Bailey said the idea of joining one of the fraternities interested him, primarily for the connections as a business major.“These organizations, any of them, give you a vast network that you otherwise would not be able to tap into,” he said. “Also, being a black man, I do stand with some of the values and the core principles that these organizations were founded upon, and look to try to continue that in my day-to-day life.""


 


National and local traditionThe National Pan-Hellenic Council, which has historically maintained predominantly black membership, was first established at Howard University in 1930, and since has coalesced around a ‘Divine 9’ group of nationally chartered fraternities and sororities.At UGA, the National Pan-Hellenic Council first arrived in 1969 when the Alpha Phi Alpha and Delta Sigma Theta chapters were founded. The goals of all chapters, as the presenters said at the event, are to encourage social and cultural activities, as well as enrich the lives of members.LaPorsche Thomas, the president of the UGA NPHC, said her mission is “educating everyone, making sure people on campus know about NPHC and the values we stand for.” ""We want to show eople that we do come together, especially in the Greek community. We all wear letters.""-Marcus Hill, president of Phi Beta Sigma


 


She said NPHC serves a special purpose in the community.“We’re leaders,” Thomas said. “The whole format and base of why NPHC was needed was because we weren’t allowed in any other organizations.”Victor Wilson, the vice president for student affairs at the university, addressed the gathering of current and prospective Greek Life participants to highlight the importance of the organizations.“Greek Life at UGA is above 25 percent, and NPHC coming here in the 1970s taught the campus what the culture was all about, as well as how to be black, or sometimes, how not to be black,” he said.Wilson recalled his days at the university as a fraternity member when the step show events made Memorial Hall nearly impassable due to the surrounding throng. It was on the back of this that he stressed the need to “create a legacy.”“We don’t want black Greek life at UGA to die off,” he said, noting declining participation in the NPHC. Despite the low numbers, Wilson championed “permanence and survival,”“It’s not as strong as maybe it could be or should be, but I do feel like it’s not something that we could ever give up on,” Bailey said. “These organizations have been around for a long time, and I don’t feel like they’re going anywhere. As long as we continue to invest in them, they can keep going.”

Giving back to the communityThe NPHC hosts an annual FaceOff Step Show, which draws in huge crowds, with this year’s date on Feb. 5. However, members said there was more to their organizations than the entertainment.The organizations were founded during times of intense oppression in the nation’s history, and thus have a heavy focus on service. Several, such as the Zeta Phi Beta sorority, include it as part of their mission statements and emphasize it as a definitive aspect of their organization.

Ashley Simpson, treasurer of Zeta Phi Beta, said at the time of founding in 1920, its “women believed that sorority elitism and socializing overshadowed progressive mission of organizations,” and thus created the organization.Omega Psi Phi offers mentoring in local Athens-Clarke County schools, while Sigma Gamma Rho hosts Big Book Bag, an initiative designated for helping kids obtain costly school supplies. Alpha Phi Alpha hosts voter registration drives.Marcus Hill, president of Phi Beta Sigma, said the NPHC organizations are also important because they try to make sure other organizations understand the issues that affect the black community.“We want to show guys that we’re more than just the dudes you see stepping in Tate,” he said. “We’re also very community service-based, and that’s pretty much our importance. We want to show people not only our core values, but also how we do things, things that we are actually focused on improving in our community.”

Diversity on campusDespite the university integration more than half a decade ago, black students make up less than 10 percent of the total student body. Given this low representation, Bailey said a lot of black students choose to be involved in student organizations.Because of the active presence of black students, Hill said he is optimistic of other students recognizing and including them.“Everybody understands their part of diversity, and people do their part to include us,” he said.He also spoke in favor of the push for unity in Greek life.“In recent years, we want to bridge those gaps of division,” he said. “We want to show people that we do come together, especially in the Greek community. We all wear letters.”Although NPHC has a “deep-rooted history of the black community,” Hill said the organization remains open to all.“Anybody is welcome to join,” he said. “We make sure that we go out for everybody because we want everybody to participate.”

The organizations all highlighted some of their notable alumni, including non-black members such as Bill Clinton and Hubert Humphrey.Thomas said every member of the NPHC desires equality with other Greek Life organizations.“Look, we’re your equal,” she said. “We have a college education just like you. We’re doing community service just like you. We’re human just like you, and we’re trying to show that by being excellent members of society.”","Julien Gelly

25-Aug-16,Column: Gunnar Bentz not guilty by association,"Georgia swimmer Gunnar Bentz experienced every kind of emotion at the Rio de Janeiro Olympics.He went through the highs of being a part of the gold medal 4x200-meter freestyle relay team for the United States. But he also went through the lows of being detained at an airport and having a weapon pointed toward him just days later.All in all, it was an eventful trip for the 20-year-old junior at the University of Georgia.


 


For those who have not been keeping up with world news, Ryan Lochte told police he, Bentz and teammates Jimmy Feigen and Jack Conger were involved in an armed robbery the day after the swimming portion of the Olympics concluded.That account proved untrue. Lochte slightly exaggerated the initial story. The four U.S. swimmers were instead involved in a confrontation with security guards at a convenience store early Sunday morning.As more details came out, it became clear that both the Olympians as well as the security guards were at fault.Were it not for the swimmers drunkenly relieving themselves in public rather than using a restroom or Lochte tearing down a framed metal advertisement, they would not have given the security guards a reason to ask the Olympians to step out of their taxi and sit on the sidewalk.In his frustration, Lochte began yelling at the security guards causing the situation to become even more tense.Eventually another customer, who was able to speak both English and Portuguese, approached and helped make sense of things. The swimmers gave the security guards $70 and were then able to leave the scene.Note how Lochte lost his cool and vandalized the convenience store. Lochte, the 32-year-old veteran, the 12-time Olympic medalist across three Summer Games, and one of the leaders on the United States’ team put the other swimmers’ lives in danger.


 


 [Lochte] left a bad taste in the mouth of those who watched and were involved in the Olympic Games.It wasn’t the 20-year-old Bentz who began yelling at the security guards. It wasn’t the 21-year-old Conger ripping down signs. And it wasn’t the 26-year-old Feigen exaggerating the accounts of that night while fleeing the country before the rest of his teammates.It was Lochte who was the instigator of the entire chain of events. Although he has publicly apologized to the country of Brazil and its people, the swimmer left a bad taste in the mouth of those who watched and were involved in the Olympic Games.While Bentz admitted he was never a suspect and was foolish at times that night, he as well as Conger and Feigen, should not be guilty by association as the three of them have fully complied to Brazilian officials requests.","John Durham

26-Aug-16,Voting date set for Athens-Clarke County anti-discrimination ordinance,"Almost nine months after the issue was first presented to the Athens-Clarke County commission, a proposed anti-discrimination ordinance is set to be voted on Sept. 6.The anti-discrimination ordinance is meant to address systematic discrimination downtown, brought to the forefront in January when former University of Georgia Student Government Association senator Andrew Roberts presented the commission with dozens of anecdotal claims of racism at downtown bars from students at the university.However, some Athens locals at the commission’s agenda-setting session Aug. 16 said the issue of discrimination extends far beyond downtown. They argue instead that the ordinance is purely a bar-admittance ordinance, and does nothing to address the root cause of discrimination in the community.  


 


“We can’t pass the proposed ordinance as it is and expect to change anything,” Heidi Elrod said. “The ordinance only addresses two single issues at exclusively bars. We need the intent of this ordinance directed at all Athens businesses to target and suppress any type of discrimination.”

The ordinance in its current form would require bars to post its dress code so that it is visible at the front of the bar and would require bars to keep records about any private event that it host. This specific wording stems from complaints from Roberts’ reports, which cited dress codes and private events as common ways bars in downtown Athens discriminate. Under the current wording of the ordinance, the Athens-Clarke County Attorney’s Office would handle any complaints of discrimination at bars downtown, using the administrative process to call people to testify in cases of alleged discrimination and possibly revoke liquor licenses.  “There’s a complaint process set up. My office will review complaints and if my office finds a reasonable basis that discrimination did occur or violations occurred based upon a citizen complaint, then … my office will go to the administrative hearing officer and essentially represent the government in this case,” said William Berryman, the Athens-Clarke County Attorney.“Discrimination is something that if you haven’t really lived through it, it sounds real good that we can get this thing, paint over it and it’ll all go away, but it doesn’t go away ... It’s gonna take a lot of work of changing people’s hearts.”-Harry Sims, District 2 commissioner 


 


Many at the agenda-setting meeting said the Attorney’s Office alone would be ineffective at enforcing discrimination complaints.“While our current attorney may be a fair equitable administration of justice, who's to say the next attorney will be fair and equitable?” said Alvin Sheats, former District 3 commissioner, at the meeting. “He could be tyrannical.”Many members of the community have called for the establishment of a civil rights committee, which could handle discrimination complaints as well as serve as a liaison between the county and minority communities, educate the community on diversity, collect data on acts of discrimination and give action recommendations to the Athens- Clarke County government.A model of the bylaws of the hypothetical civil rights committee were penned by the local advocacy group Athens For Everyone in coordination with the Anti-Discrimination Movement, which outlines what the organization would like as the purpose, structure and duties of the committee, according to Jesse Houle, the outreach coordinator at Athens For Everyone.“I’m here tonight to urge you … to incorporate a civil rights committee into the proposed ordinance,” said Briana Bivens, the education campaign coordinator for Athens for Everyone, at the agenda-setting meeting. “To leave the mediating of authority in the hands of a single individual is to miss a critical opportunity to heighten the voices of Athens-Clarke County residents.” Speakers also were quick to point out that many other college towns across the United States already have civil rights committees or analogous organizations.“There are over 150 cities and counties around the country that have created and utilized human relations or civil rights commissions,” said Greg Wagstaff. “Certain college towns across the country also have a civil rights commission.”

Athens locals and commissioners alike also said diversity would be a priority for a civil rights committee if one is created.

“Who would be appointing this committee, and if it’s us, when we look at the diversity of [the commission], we have a lot of work to do,” said District 2 Commissioner Harry Sims. “[Appointing people to the committee] is something we need to take a real big look at. Sometimes when we appoint these committees, there is very little diversity.” Sims said he has dealt with discrimination in his life and urged the commission to choose those who have also faced discrimination when appointing people to a civil rights committee.“Discrimination is something that if you haven’t really lived through it, it sounds real good that we can get this thing, paint over it and it’ll all go away, but it doesn’t go away. You live with those things, those things stay with you forever,” Sims said. “It’s gonna take a lot of work of changing people’s hearts.”The commission also spoke of extending the ordinance to cover restaurants with alcohol licenses, whereas in earlier drafts it would have only applied to bars which earn 50 percent or more of their revenue from alcohol sales, according to Berryman.","John Hammel

28-Aug-16,Director of UGA Food Services addresses long lines at campus dining locations,"Between the new Panda Express in the Bulldog Café and the Coca-Cola Freestyle soda machines that began popping up on the University of Georgia campus over the summer, UGA Food Services has been doing its best to keep up with the demands of students. While many students appear to like the changes, given the amount of Panda Express bags seen around campus, some students, including Vishal Patel, have noticed an subsequent increase in the lines. 


 


 “Everyone else seems to like the changes,” Patel, a senior biology major, said in reference to the new soda machines. “They’ve caused longer lines, though.” When asked about the longer lines, Bryan Varin, the interim executive director of UGA Food Services, said he and others in the administration had anticipated the initial increase, but that the lines have actually been shorter than they were expecting.  “We have found that students and guests come into the situation knowing for the most part how to operate them,” he said.  While Varin has seen longer lines at the machines in the dining commons, he said the same issue has not occurred in the Tate Café or the Bulldog Café, both of which have also added the new machines. 


 


 In order to potentially speed up the process even more, he suggested students could use the Freestyle app to order their drink, which allows users to save their favorite mixes to their phone and then order quickly through the use of a QR Code scanner on the machine. Varin demonstrated how, using the app, students and guests can change the percentage of which drinks they would like to mix.  “We feel like we’ve seen our guest satisfaction related to the machines increase because students really like the fact that they have 140 different flavor combinations, rather than just the eight flavor combinations,” he said.  Food Services are planning to update the drink machines in the Bolton Dining Commons and Village Summit Dining Commons over the winter break. 


TNCMS.AdManager.render({region: 'fixed-big-ad-bottom-asset', slot: 1, fold: ""below""});


 “We strategically picked Oglethorpe and Snelling [to go first] because we know that Bolton is incredibly busy all of the time,” Varin said. Beyond the freestyle machines, the dining locations have also experienced longer lines with after updates to the retail locations. Despite the longer lines, however, Varin said customers should still expect quick service.  “We try to keep our ticket time under 50 seconds,” he said, referring to the amount of time between when a person orders and when that person gets his or her food. According to Varin, the current ticket time averages are around 46 seconds at the updated Chick-Fil-A venue. He said he credits the workers for the relatively-low ticket time, as well as the success of the new venues.

29-Aug-16,UGA Panhellenic Council recognized for 'College Panhellenic Excellence' by national council,"When 1,553 collegiate women went through recruitment the week of Aug. 8, they may not have realized they were rushing at a National Panhellenic Council award-winning school.According to a press release from the council, the University of Georgia was recognized as one of 27 schools to receive an award for College Panhellenic Excellence.


 


Claudia Shamp, the director of Greek Life at UGA, said she was not surprised that the UGA Panhellenic Council won the award for a second year in a row.“I’m always thrilled that our Panhellenic women are acknowledged or receive recognition for the good work that they do,” she said. “They work really, really hard and do a lot of wonderful things, and I’m just happy that they’re getting the recognition they deserve.""Both Shamp and UGA Panhellenic Council President Victoria Martin said the award showcased the hard work the UGA Panhellenic Council has been doing for years.“I wouldn’t say anything changed dramatically [over the past two years], but I think that always having the mindset of wanting to be better and never being complacent with how we are doing [played a role in the recent recognition],"" Martin said.The award, created in 2013, serves to recognize certain College Panhellenic Associations for “excellence and achievement in their on-campus work to advance the sorority experience,” according to the press release. The NPC has a large number of organizations across North America — there are over 670 different groups at U.S. and Canadian colleges and universities.Out of over 670 different NPC organizations at U.S. and Canadian colleges and universities, UGA, along with six other SEC schools, was chosen for its excellence in seven distinct categories. The most important criteria noted by the NPC included academics, programming and community relations.“Our academics are exceptional,"" Shamp said. ""That in and of itself is something that is important to the university and is a student’s top priority, and I think Panhellenic’s contribution to the academic mission of the university is significant.”Of the recognized SEC colleges with data available to view for the 2015-2016 school year, UGA had the highest grade point average with 3.51 in spring of 2016. The university beat out Texas A&M University, the University of Alabama, the University of Arkansas and the University of South Carolina. Louisiana State University and the University of Tennessee did not have current data on their Panhellenic GPA available.


 


“This is the first time the average GPA has exceeded a 3.5, so we’re really proud that academics remain the first priority,"" Martin said.As far as community relations, Shamp and Martin were both quick to point to the student pantry that the Greek Life Office oversees. Martin also pointed out the influence Greek life has on UGA students' philanthropic endeavors.Even with incomplete fundraising numbers, Martin said the Panhellenic community raised $779,000 in the 2015-2016 school year.As for what the organizations at UGA can improve upon, Shamp said fixing the Greek system is always an ongoing process.“Everything is in constant improvement mode. One of the things we always try to do is just to tweak things,” she said. “Sometimes the smallest tweak can give you significant improvement in a program.”Specifically, Shamp said she and the Panhellenic Council executive board have been working to ensure future recruitment goes as smoothly as possible. Martin echoed Shamp's sentiments, adding that the fall 2016 recruitment was the smoothest recruitment process they have had.The executive board is also looking to improve inclusiveness within the Greek community, Martin said. “I think inclusivity and always collaboration between the Panhellenic community and other Greek communities on campus, including NPHC and IFC and MGC, that’s always been a really big goal,"" she said. ""The collaboration between those organizations has been a leading force over the past year. I’d like to see that move forward.”

29-Aug-16,"Nick Chubb cleared to play, Smart comments on status of other running backs","After a gruesome knee injury in October, a limited spring and months of sporting a black, non-contact jersey at practice, junior Nick Chubb has been cleared to play in Georgia’s season opener against North Carolina.On Monday, head coach Kirby Smart said that the tailback is ready to carry the ball in the Georgia Dome on Sept. 3.“It's a situation where he's scrimmaged and done live things,” Smart said. “He's had a lot of practices where he's carried it more than five or seven times. I feel good about Nick. He feels great and is ready to go. He won't be on a pitch count by any means.”


 


Last season, Chubb rushed for 747 yards and accumulated seven touchdowns in the six games he played. Against Tennessee in October, Chubb’s season ended after he damaged multiple ligaments in his knee.“It was pretty frightening when it happened,” senior center Brandon Kublanow said. “But I know Nick. He's an incredibly hard worker, so there was no doubt in my mind that he'd be ready to go.”After Chubb’s injury, Sony Michel emerged as the team’s top rusher and he finished the season with 1,161 yards. However, for this year’s opener, uncertainty exists as to whether or not he will be available to play.Michel suffered a fractured forearm in an ATV accident in July. Lately, Michel has been wearing a black, non-contact jersey at practice.“He's been practicing every day,” Smart said. “He goes up there and does everything he can. He hasn't been clear to tackle live. His situation is day-to-day. We're getting updates every day, and he's doing more each practice.”To add to the injuries in the backfield, freshman Elijah Holyfield recently had a minor ankle injury and Smart said he is “day-to-day” and “still gimpy on the ankle.”Still though, with Chubb back to full health, certainly Georgia’s run game and even its pass game benefits.“The defense that we're going to play against, they're always going to fear the run knowing that we have someone back there that's gonna dominate the run,” wide receiver Terry Godwin said. “That's going to open up the passing game for us receivers.”


 


Chubb hasn't played a game in 10 months. But his teammates don't think he'll look like a different Chubb.“Even more physical than what he was before [the injury],” defensive tackle DaQuan Hawkins-Muckle said. “Nick Chubb's always been a hard runner, but he's an even harder runner.”","Emily Giambalvo

29-Aug-16,An abundance of 'or': Kirby Smart resists naming starters,"On Georgia’s game-week depth chart, the most common word wasn’t a name, a position or even the word Georgia. The most frequent mention on the list — 21 times to be exact — was the word, “OR.”Written in all caps between player names, it signifies that the internal position rankings are nowhere near solidified in the week leading up to Georgia’s season opener against North Carolina.“A lot of ‘ors’ on there because you’ve got to play a lot of people when people play fast,” head coach Kirby Smart said.


 


Only three positions on Georgia’s offense have a starter who stands alone — center Brandon Kublanow, right tackle Greg Pyke and tight end Jeb Blazevich.“Am I an 'or' guy?,” Kublanow said when asked about the abundance of “ors.”Reporters told him that he was not.“I was about to say, that's messed up,” Kublanow said.On the offense alone, eight of the 11 positions have multiple players listed as possible starters, including the most talked about — quarterback. Greyson Lambert, Brice Ramsey and Jacob Eason were all listed as possibilities, even though Smart said on Monday that the position battle had been narrowed to Lambert and Eason.It’s possible that not all of the “ors” are necessary — tailback Nick Chubb was listed as competing for the spot with Brendan Douglas, even though Smart said that Chubb was cleared and ready to play.Regardless, if points were scored for this two-letter word, Georgia would be trampling UNC 21-6. Only two of the spots of uncertainty for the Tar Heels are for starters. “We got a lot of great competition at a lot of positions,” Smart said. “A lot of guys deserve ‘ors.’”

29-Aug-16,Practice Report: Quarterback rotation changes again,"The Georgia football team held a practice session on Monday. Members of the media were allowed 12 minutes of viewing time. Here are some observations as made by The Red & Black.Offensive NotesRight before the end of the media viewing period portion of practice Monday, offensive coordinator Jim Chaney told the first-team offense to go to the practice field on the right side and the second-team offense to go to the practice field on the left side.


 


Freshman Jacob Eason trotted over and joined the second-team and senior Greyson Lambert stayed with the first-team offense. Earlier in the day, head coach Kirby Smart narrowed down the race for quarterback to just Eason and Lambert.Before the quarterback rotation changed again on Monday, the two quarterbacks along with junior Brice Ramsey worked together on dropping back for passes in unison. They also worked on a drill where someone would come in to rush the quarterback and they would dodge him and run out of the pocket.The quarterbacks then worked on making passes to a receiver over the middle of the field. Eason hit wide receiver Terry Godwin over the middle of the field for a completion but over-threw another receiver in a deep route.All of the quarterbacks were fairly accurate during the drill, but Ramsey and Lambert were more accurate than Eason on Monday during the media viewing portion of practice. Running back Elijah Holyfield continued to shake off his ankle sprain. Holyfield dodged through practice dummies and appeared to run with no limitations while wearing a contact jersey. Smart said Holyfield was considered day-to-day earlier at a press conference on Monday.Running back Sony Michel remained in a black contact jersey at practice. Michel has still yet to be cleared to be tackled during practices according to Smart.The rest of the running backs and wide receivers worked on jump balls in a circle attempting to control position. Defensive Notes


 


The defensive backs worked on coverage drills. The position group was mostly just walking through the drills to understand the type of coverage together. The defensive linemen worked on their typical drill where associate head coach and defensive line coach Tracy Rocker. Rocker, who was wearing pads on his arms, would have the linemen come up to him and smack at the pads before running over my hurdles. The linemen do this drill to work on agility and hand placement. The linemen also worked on one-on-one drills against each other with Rocker watching closely. Rocker would yell out to a player to work on hand placement whenever he felt the time called for it.","John Durham

30-Aug-16,"Practice Report: Lambert takes first-team reps, Quincy Mauger returns to first-team defense","The Georgia football team held a practice session on Tuesday. Members of the media were allowed 12 minutes of viewing time. Here are some observations as made by The Red & Black. Offensive Notes:Georgia’s quarterbacks were in the same order as they were Monday at Tuesday’s practice. Greyson Lambert was with the first team, with Jacob Eason second. Each time the team cycled through a new drill, it was Lambert first and Eason second.


 


Sony Michel was in a black jersey again as he has been with a brace on his left arm. Kirby Smart said a few days ago that the junior running back could be a game-time decision. Elijah Holyfield was not limited in practice, and was a full participant in drills.Offensive line coach Sam Pittman had praise for freshman offensive lineman Solomon Kindley. “Getting better, 66,” he said after a drill where the linemen worked on getting leverage.Defensive Notes:The defense is putting on the final touches to stop a North Carolina offense that averaged 40.7 points per game a season ago.The outside linebackers worked on getting around blockers while the inside linebackers worked on moving off of cut blocks and then wrapping up the ball carrier.Getting to the running back will be crucial for the Georgia defense as they try to stop the Carolina rushing attack, which averaged 224.4 rushing yards per game last season.The defensive backs worked on meeting the ball at the highest point during the first period of the media viewing, and transitioned to work on coverage schemes during the latter period.Senior safety Quincy Mauger, who has been nursing an ankle injury most of preseason camp, was running with the first team with no limitations. Mauger had previously been working with the second-team defense as he returned from injury, with junior Aaron Davis at first-team safety in his place.

30-Aug-16,Georgia might want to consider punting out of bounds versus North Carolina,"Ryan Switzer caught the ball on his own 40-yard line. He ran left toward the sideline, allowing his blocking to set up. When it seemed he would be forced to run out of bounds, he cut back right, shed a tackle and ran untouched to the end zone.It was Switzer’s second punt return for a touchdown that day in 2013, as North Carolina beat Pittsburgh, 34-27.When Georgia inevitably has to punt at some point during its game on Saturday versus North Carolina, it might want to consider punting the ball out of bounds to avoid any chance of the senior returning one for a score.


 


Over the course of his three-year career, Switzer has returned seven punts for touchdowns, which is one less than the NCAA record held by Wes Welker and Antonio Perkins.“I know on special teams that's going to be their key guy and that's who we have to watch out for with his punt returns,” wide receiver Terry Godwin said. “He's an amazing athlete.”Georgia head coach Kirby Smart said the Bulldogs are using their own punt returner, Isaiah McKenzie, to simulate Switzer’s punt returns during practice. McKenzie, who’s nickname is “The Human Joystick,” has returned four punts for touchdowns in his career.In 2015, Switzer was voted a first-team All-American as an all-purpose player by the American Football Coaches Association. In 2013, he was voted a first-team All-American as a punt returner by the Football Writers Association of America and Athlon. That season, Switzer returned an ACC-record five punts for touchdowns.He’s also a threat on the offensive side of the ball. Last season, Switzer caught 55 passes for 697 yards and six touchdowns. He runs crisp, precise routes, and Smart said Switzer knows how to manipulate a defensive back’s leverage to get open. He’s even thrown two touchdown passes in his career.With 6-foot-4 wide receiver Mack Hollins suspended for the first half due to a targeting penalty in last season’s bowl game, the 5-foot-10 Switzer will be quarterback Mitch Trubisky’s main target to start the game.“He's a scary guy,” Smart said. “He's fearless. He's been a major emphasis for us.”","Wilson Alexander

31-Aug-16,Behind Enemy Bylines: Previewing Georgia vs. North Carolina,"Behind Enemy Bylines is a series in which The Red & Black discusses Georgia's upcoming game with the sports editor of the student newspaper of Georgia’s opponent for that week.This week, assistant sports editor Wilson Alexander talked to C Jackson Cowart of The Daily Tar Heel about this season's opening game.Wilson Alexander: Obviously North Carolina won its division last year, went 11-3, how are those players feeling about being able to repeat last year's success?


 


C Jackson Cowart: It certainly seems like they're feeling pretty confident. Obviously they lost Marquise Williams, a quarterback who was this huge catalyst for everything they did last year. But [quarterback] Mitch Trubisky coming in, he's almost a starter-in-waiting. I think, and the rest of his teammates think, he is as talented and capable of leading the offense as Williams was. When you add guys like Elijah Hood, who should only be better, a receiving core that is honestly one of the best in the conference, if not the nation - they feel pretty good. It seems like a tough schedule, obviously starting out against a team like Georgia and some of the other trips they have. Their record might not show it, but this is a team that thinks it's more talented than last year and honestly is more talented than it was a year ago.WA: Trubisky didn't play a whole lot last year, but you mentioned how he's already kind of a starter. I think [head coach] Larry Fedora said something about that the other day, right?JC: The fact of the matter is [Trubisky]'s been practicing with the first-team [and] he's been taking first-team practice reps for two years now. He thought he was going to start right away, and Fedora's put him in game situations. Every time he comes off the bench it seems like he makes a huge play. He's told me that he feels like he's had a starter mentality for two years. Of course every backup says it, but he's shown it. Every time he comes into the game he excels. He's practiced like a starter, he's gone to the games like a starter, Fedora has treated him like a quasi-starter and now that he's here all his teammates are saying, 'Yeah, that's our guy. He's as ready to be a starter as anyone in the country.'WA: So, UNC is definitely much more solid at quarterback than Georgia is. Kirby Smart said he doesn't want to tip his hand to North Carolina at all there, is UNC thinking at all about that? What have those guys said about the Georgia quarterback situation?JC: They haven't been talking about it at practice at least. They're usually tight-lipped until the week before anyway, but from what I gathered their main concern is stopping the running game. [Cornerbacks] Des Lawrence and M.J. Stewart are both guys that could garner All-America honors, they're both that gifted. I don't really think UNC is concerned about defending the pass as much as trying to stop Nick Chubb and trying to stop the rushing attack. I think that's going to be their main focus because that's what Georgia can bring to the table best.WA: I'm sure that defense has to have improved. Obviously gave up a whole lot of yards on the ground [645] against Baylor last year in that bowl game, and I'm sure Georgia is going to try to exploit it. You think that's a key to the game then? I would think so.JC: Yeah, I think so. When I look at the game from a UNC perspective I think that could be their biggest undoing because you mentioned, last year in the Baylor game they had a record-setting poor performance against the run. Perhaps their best run defender, Nazair Jones, was out for that game and he's back and in full-health this year, but that's the one guy. UNC lost their two-best linebackers and you're looking at a front-seven that probably isn't better than it was a year ago. Might have some growing pains when you're first matchup is against a guy like Chubb. That is the biggest weakness that I think Georgia can, and probably will, exploit. I honestly don't know how UNC is going to be able to stop that. They're going to have to hope their high-powered offense is enough to match that. WA: It seems like it could be a high scoring game then, what's your prediction?


 


JC: That's a tough one. Honestly, I think Georgia is going to be able to get a solid ground game against UNC, and I think they're going to put-up points that way. My personal opinion is Mitch Trubisky, coming into his first game with the weapons he has around him, is going to be able to put up as good of a challenge against Kirby Smart and the defense as maybe close to anybody that Georgia's going to face this year, at least as an offensive threat. If Mitch Trubisky can click like I think he will, I think you could be looking at a 31-27 game. I don't think it's going to be hugely defensive, but Carolina's going to put up some points. I think they're going to struggle to stop Chubb, but I think UNC is going to squeak it out in the end.WA: Is there anything else, talking UNC, that Georgia fans should know?JC: I think one thing that's interesting that probably is music to Georgia fans' ears is Mack Hollins, who in my opinion is UNC's best receiver, isn't going to play for the first half. He's still serving that targeting suspension. So, I think if Georgia can capitalize early and put UNC in a two-score deficit or really assert themselves, then that's going to do wonders. Because if it's a close game coming out of half-time and Mack Hollins, as fiery of a guy as he is, is charged up and running down the field and trying to make plays as he does, I think if Georgia hasn't buried UNC by then they're really going to have to watch out for Mack Hollins, who's going to be probably more motivated for the second half of that game than any half he's had in his career.","Wilson Alexander & C Jackson Cowart

1-Sep-16,Greyson Lambert named starting quarterback for Georgia,"Senior Greyson Lambert was named the starter at quarterback for Georgia on Thursday morning, according to reports confirmed by the Atlanta-Journal Constitution. A team spokesmen also confirmed this news to the Athens Banner-Herald. Lambert started in 12 out of 13 games for the Bulldogs last year and compiled a 10-2 record as the starter by throwing for 1,959 yards with 12 touchdowns and two interceptions. The only game he did not start in was a loss against Florida. Lambert was named the starter ahead of freshman quarterback Jacob Eason. Eason had been taking first-team reps with the offense for the past couple weeks. That changed this week though with Lambert getting reps with the first-team offense during media viewing periods on both Monday and Tuesday.

1-Sep-16,OPINION: Election 2016 is stranger than fiction,"“Diehard Trump Votes Confirm Rest of Nation Should Stop Wasting Time Trying To Reach them”, “Hillary Clinton hits ‘The Dab’ on Ellen DeGeneres’ show”, and “Republicans To Pull Money From Trump Ads and Spend It On Alcohol”, are just a few titles of articles about the upcoming election. One is a real headline from FoxSports, the rest are from satirical publications such as The Onion, and the Borowitz Report via The New Yorker.It’s become increasingly difficult to tell political satire from reality.And that’s a problem because the line between what is politics, and what is pure shock-value entertainment is blurring. We can no longer tell what odd statement or brash stunt is actually our own politicians, acting as our representatives in government. And while we have been getting chuckles out of occurrences like Hillary Clinton’s “Chillary Clinton” vine or Donald Trump’s eccentric mannerisms, beneath the quotable moments, is a real trend in our politics. Entertainment is the one concession an increasingly restless public is taking from this 2016 Presidential election, and it points to some ominous trends in both our society and our government.


 


For most, politics isn’t inherently interesting. Things like the national budget, foreign policy, or immigration tactics are not glamorous or sexy. C-Span’s agenda for Aug. 29 includes a 45 minute discussion on threats to affordable housing in U.S. cities, and an 1 hour and 30 minute panel on the defense budget and that’s the lighter material for discussion. However, the lack of entertainment value does not minimize the importance of these topics. These are the numbers, documents, and panel discussions that shape our nation’s future.The fact that the process seems dull to most is because politics is slow moving. The smallest decisions must be deliberated, meditated over and filed in triplicate. We are a representative government for this very reason, so that not every decision must be made by the people, but by their knowledgeable stand-ins in the political sphere. It’s a boring, tedious and seemingly thankless task turning up at the polls to cast votes for those public servants, but in doing so we can ensure that we, as voters, will not be directly responsible for the constant decision making, meetings and strategy that goes into being a politician, on both the national and local basis. Instead, we can sleep soundly knowing our proxies are slogging through bureaucracy in our stead, representing our best interests.We put our trust in politicians to do their jobs, so that we don’t have to do them. We look at their beliefs and political leanings, decide if they agree with a majority of what we ourselves believe, and vote hoping they will represent our own personal political makeup. But what happens when our politics begin to resemble a particularly contentious episode of “Keeping Up With the Kardashians”? What happens when we find ourselves laughing at our politicians partly due to sarcastic dread and partly due to their own buffoonery? The answer is, our own political system stops being credible.I’m not saying politics can’t be fun. Politicians have been entertaining us in little ways since time immemorial, from FDR’s fireside chats to our actor-turned-president Ronald Regan’s one-liners, we’re used to song and dance from our leaders. But what is dangerous is when this entertainment value is not pageantry, an example of wit or a way to humanize the goings-on upstairs. The danger is when theinept are put in charge because they are the most outrageous candidate, when politicians believe the way into office is by knowing recent dance crazes or appearing on the right late night variety show. It becomes dangerous when politicians are even adopting a pretense of pushing their platforms, and instead are seemingly trying to out-do the other with the bigger, better insult.We are in a time of change in government. It’s a time when both political parties are fracturing from the inside, states are shifting party allegiance, and the third-party Libertarian candidate is garnering campaign buzz. Change doesn’t necessarily mean that our political system is in danger, only that it is becoming something new. Whether for better or worse, remains to be seen. However, my concern is that we are losing the delicate balance our politicians have long skated between celebrity and public servant. In this new era of politics, will it be a time when politics is still the reason we cast our vote, or will it be whoever made us laugh harder with their antics?",Shelby Masters,opinion,https://www.redandblack.com/opinion/opinion-election-is-stranger-than-fiction/article_5aa30c30-704a-11e6-8383-ab2e9a4ca418.html

Senior Greyson Lambert was named the starter at quarterback for Georgia on Thursday morning. Lambert started in 12 out of 13 games for the Bulldogs last year and compiled a 10-2 record as the starter by throwing for 1,959 yards with 12 touchdowns and two interceptions. The only game he did not start in was a loss against Florida.","Katelyn Umholtz

2-Sep-16,Congressman Jody Hice describes politician experience to UGA College Republicans,"The University of Georgia College Republicans hosted Jody Hice, the U.S. House representative from Georgia’s 10th congressional district, as a guest speaker at their meeting Wednesday evening.Speaking to a room of about 50 people, Hice described legislation he hopes to pass through Congress, his achievements as a member of congressional committees and lessons learned from time spent in Congress.While Hice said he has been working on several pieces of legislation, he highlighted two bills in particular that he hopes to pass through Congress: the Protecting Veterans’ Educational Choice Act of 2016 and the the Track Reoffending Alien Criminals Act.


 


@jodyhice talks media bias, national debt, bipartisanship on the Hill, and the success of the OGR committee. #gapol pic.twitter.com/ssVCUgy6Um— UGA Republicans (@UGACRs) August 31, 2016When explaining the former, Hice said the bill, which deals with veteran education, is ""getting a significant amount of traction.""Hice said he found that when veterans come back from their line of duty and attempt to transition back to civilian life, many come back wanting to further their education and career opportunities. Yet, according to Hice, there are multiple schools that “prey” on veterans because the schools they attend are not accredited.“What we found out is that many of these schools are not accredited, and that the degrees that veterans earn won’t transfer to other schools, or that the degree isn’t accredited, and they were not having something that they thought they were getting.” he said.“We put forth a bill that simply says this; a veteran can go to whatever school they want to go to. It’s no business of ours to tell them where they can go to school, but what our bill says is they need the information upfront as to whether or not that is an accredited degree or whether that degree is going to transfer to another school or not. They need that information before they make the decision.”The other bill Hice is sponsoring, the TRAC Act, focuses on tracking illegal immigrants who have committed sex crimes after they are released from prison.“What we found out is that many of these individuals, they are released after they serve time, they’re not deported, and, this was amazing to me, they’re not even required to be registered on a national sex offender registry,” he said. “We put forth a bill that says we need to know who these people are, law enforcement need to know who they are, where they were released, when they were released, and that they at least be placed on the national sex offender registry.""


 


However, the congressman told students not to expect legislation to advance for the rest of the year.“Don’t expect any major legislation to go forward for the rest of this year,"" he said. ""It never happens in a presidential election year.""Hice is also part of the Oversight and Government Reform Committee, and highlighted the committee's achievements since he had joined.As described on U.S. House of Representatives website, the Oversight and Government reform committee’s main responsibility is ""oversight of virtually everything government does.""“Where there was waste, fraud, abuse, scandals, inefficiency, anything along those lines, it comes up the jurisdiction of Government Oversight and Reform,” Hice said.He said the committee has been “massively busy this past year and a half.”“I say it jokingly, because it has been such an eye opening experience, but I say that these days, our three branches of government, are waste, fraud and abuse,” he said. “That’s what it really feels like sometimes.”Hice described what the OGR committee has achieved while he has been in office.

“We have, in this first term, literally called for the removal from their office, their position, their title, 23 different heads of various agencies and departments because of the waste, fraud, abuse, scandals, all that sort of stuff,” he explained. “We have succeeded in removing 20 out of the 23, which is pretty remarkable.”Hice also shared his frustrations with how he believes the media misrepresents members of Congress.“I don’t know why, I can guess, I can have my ideas as much as you do, as to why the media doesn’t report that type of thing,” he explained. “All they report on is Congress never does anything, nobody’s getting anything accomplished, nothing ever happens in Washington. There are things that are happening.”Hice detailed to those in the audience the difficulties of trying to pass legislation through Congress.“It is extremely difficult to move the needle in Washington D.C.,"" he said. ""It is extremely difficult to move the needle legislatively, for example. I can’t even begin to describe to you.”Hice said it was not long after becoming a member of Congress that he realized his vote on its own was not worth much.“As a member of Congress, I am less than a quarter of one percent,” he said. “It’s hard to move the needle with those kinds of odds.”The only way to pass legislation, he said, is to build a coalition of people who are like-minded on a particular policy.

“That’s why when you watch C-SPAN, and a vote is taking place, and it looks like total chaos, everyone’s running around talking, and it looks like no one’s paying attention, and it’s because people are trying to build a coalition around something that they’re passionate about,"" he said.Hice also spoke about the lessons he had learned so far as a member of Congress, and the role his faith plays in daily decision making.“Ministry is all about people, serving people, being a servant leader,"" he said. ""I think to be effective in Congress requires the same thing.""He said he learned the value of communication as a whole while in Congress.“I’ve really learned the value of communicating as much as possible, as many different ways as possible, and you can’t not over communicate,” he said. “You do it though telethon hall conferences, where we’ll just call 50,000 people and have a live conference on phone for people to ask questions. We send out mail, Facebook and email, every means possible.”Hice explained that, while trying to represent his constituency in the 10th Congressional District, it was difficult to make everyone happy.“You can’t please 800,000 people. It does not matter on some votes how you vote, you’re going to please some and kick a hornet’s nest with some others,” he said. “You just go to rely on your convictions and your compass and do the best you can.”","Maxime Tamsett

2-Sep-16,Athens man offers Pokémon Go security,"National Guardsman Travis Ebel is bringing a new meaning to the slogan “Gotta Catch’em All” for the popular smartphone game Pokémon Go.Ebel is a 34-year-old husband and father who is offering his own personal security services to those desiring protection, while they walk around potentially dangerous areas catching Pokémon.Although the Craigslist advertisement Ebel posted was intended as a joke, recent incidents spark a need for actual protection.


 


“The issues that have risen with the game is not a joke,” he said. “I do not find it funny, period.”Since the game’s inception on July 6, it has broken numerous records. Not only did it generate $14 million in revenue in five days, but it also set the record as the app with the most downloads in its first week. The game appears to have reached its peak, however. According to SensorTower, high ratings for the game have dropped significantly. Decline in usage has also been continuous since its peak on July 14, according to SurveyMonkey. Although Pokémon Go was more popular at its inception, assault cases involving the game have been rising across the United States, as well as in Athens. The incident in Athens involved a man approaching the victim in his car and asking if he played the game. The man then touched the victim’s inner thigh and asked him sexual-related questions before eventually leaving the victim, according to the report.According to Athens-Clarke County Deputy Chief of Police Justin Gregory, the police department often preaches about at least being in pairs when walking around in potentially dangerous environments.“People could theoretically be in areas where they’re not paying attention and could find themselves in dangerous areas,” Gregory said. “It’s clearly a distraction in your environments, and there are some realities in these environments you have to be aware of.” Ebel found out about situations such as these after he made the ad Aug. 15 and believes he can provide protection from his extensive training experience from 10 years in the National Guard.


 


“It’s easier to focus if you have somebody there watching your back. Criminals are gonna target individuals, weaker people,” Ebel said.Ebel’s safety concern with Pokémon Go is shared in locations such as in New York, where registered sex offenders now must agree in their stipulations to not download or access Pokémon Go, according to The New York Times.“Honestly I think they are about the lowest of the low as far as criminals go. I wouldn’t think twice about snatching a sexual predator up to help someone else,” Ebel said.According to the 2015 statistics from the National Sexual Violence Resource Center, one in four girls and one in six boys will be sexually abused before they turn 18. Ebel’s children are 10 and two, and he believes they are much too young to play the game. For children whose parents permit it, however, Ebel suggests a much closer monitoring of their whereabouts when they search for Pokémon.University of Georgia senior and avid Pokémon Go player David Rosemon believes Ebel’s services seem a bit extreme, but fairly interesting.“I know some people who have even gotten robbed in Atlanta for playing Pokémon go, and it’s not fair,” Rosemon said. “So that could be a fairly helpful thing for some people.”Rosemon is on level 23 in Pokémon Go. Since he spends his time battling gyms in a group, he feels he doesn't need Ebel’s protection, but that it may be increasingly helpful for children.

If hired, Ebel would walk nearby with a concealed weapon and allow the “customer” to go about their business. For players who would rather not pay for protection, Ebel urges players to engage in some form of self-defense courses.Ebel has received nothing but positive feedback on his newfound desire for protection, some from his friends in the military. According to Ebel, multiple people have even contacted him offering their assistance.  Christian Wafford is one of these concerned citizens who has his own security experience in bars and music venues.“I can see how there’s lots of danger involved in this game, and it’s deplorable. If I had to protect somebody, I would certainly do that job,” Wafford said.Gregory adds that if people want to take action, they need to think about “what it means to protect somebody,” he said.“I just wish people would be more considerate of what’s going on around them,” said Ebel.","Savannah Peat

2-Sep-16,UGA student who is deaf dedicated to helping others succeed,"Luke Bundrum is like any other college freshmen, adjusting to life on his own and his college classes. One day while goofing around in the main library, he filmed a music video with some of his new friends.But there was something distinctly different about Bundrum’s music video that separated it from most — he and his friends used American Sign Language to sign the lyrics to Justin Timberlake’s “Can’t Stop the Feeling” rather than belting out their own tune.The 18-year-old was born legally deaf. Without the help of a surgical implant, he would not be able to hear his own music video.


 


Bundrum might not be able to hear as well as most students, and answers the phone with his mother to make sure he has understood the caller clearly, but he has not allowed his disability to affect who he is. Instead, Bundrum has an infectious passion for people, and wants to dedicate his life to a special purpose — to help other people find their own callings in life.“One of my life goals is to help the deaf and hard of hearing find their place in the world,” he said. “I believe in helping others succeed, and I want to help them find what they want to do in life.”In order to accomplish his goal, Bundrum said he plans to study education, history and religion at the University of Georgia.“I’m hoping to become a teacher one day in the future and a youth pastor,” he said.Clyde Lowery, Bundrum’s former physics professor at Cherokee High School, said Bundrum has a strong faith and demonstrates it in the way he cares about other people.“Whether it is helping other students or stopping by to talk with teachers at the end of the day, Luke knows how to brighten your day,” he said.Lowery said Bundrum not only “talks the talk, but also walks the walk” when it comes to loving and encouraging others.


 


Torey Duhon, a high school friend of Bundrum who has known him since the seventh grade, also attested to Bundrum’s kindness.“He’s always trying to put a smile on someone’s face no matter what,” she said.Duhon said Bundrum always makes extra time to talk with someone when they need it.Bundrum’s inspiring personality caught the eye of members of the UGA chapter of Delta Tau Delta fraternity, which awarded him their first annual Dean William Tate Memorial Scholarship, out of several dozen applicants, for his character and future aspirations.“We all were impressed by Luke right off the bat,” said Joshua Reynolds, the vice president of the fraternity and a member of the board that awarded the scholarship to Bundrum.When the freshman walked into the fraternity’s house for the first time, Reynolds said Bundrum was automatically himself.“He arrived and just immediately stepped into the house and was complimenting us,” he said. “He didn’t say anything about himself. He wasn’t here trying to impress us or anything. It was just him being himself.”Reynolds said the scholarship board was impressed by Bundrum’s high school involvement and his academic achievements, but even more by his dedication to his future dream to become a minister and to promote the success of others, especially those with similar physical challenges.

 “I will keep on doing what I do, and I will succeed. My deafness does not define me — I define myself.”-Luke Bundrum, UGA student “In his interview, we asked the question, ‘Where do you see yourself in five years?’” Reynolds said. “For some reason, Luke’s [answer] just stayed with us throughout the entire thing.”Reynolds said Bundrum’s answer, to return to Cherokee High School and become a teaching assistant while starting a ministry in his hometown, was a “humble” answer, one Reynolds thought was realistic and attainable, but at the same time world-changing.Lowery said he knows Bundrum will be an inspiring teacher.

“I feel that the field of education will be very fortunate to have Luke,” he said. “There could be no better role model for students than Luke.”For a student just starting college, Bundrum has exceptional commitment to his dreams, Reynolds said. In an answer to an interview question on what value he would add to the four principles of the DTD fraternity — truth, courage, faith and power — Reynolds said Bundrum selected loyalty.“He said it’s loyalty not only to your fellow men, but also loyalty to yourself, to your values, your ambitions, your dreams,” Reynolds said. “Like never giving up on dream, to [him] that’s loyalty.”Reynolds said the answer was impressive to hear and was a deciding factor for the scholarship.Bundrum said he does not currently have any intentions of joining DTD or another fraternity. He said he is taking college one step at a time, enjoying the company of new friends and working through what he said are interesting and challenging classes.“I will keep on doing what I do, and I will succeed,” he said. “My deafness does not define me — I define myself.”","Lindsey Conway

3-Sep-16,OPINION: Is local always better?,"As more commercialized businesses move in on campus and in downtown Athens, students, local residents and University of Georgia alumni have debated the factors that contribute to a sustainable local economy. These contrasting perspectives were made clear after a recent Red & Black column, “The student argument for big business in Athens,” was published that supported a mixed economy.Readers shared dozens of comments on social media and on the website of The Red & Black. Comments were lightly edited for length and clarity.‘This is your community, your city.’


 


Some readers argued that small businesses have been a key factor in shaping the city of Athens. Students, they wrote, should appreciate the local shops and contribute to the community by supporting and shopping in them.“Students of UGA, I take it that most of you are not native to this small, university town. But this town is your home for the next few years. Step off campus and experience it. This is where you practice adulthood and grow into the general shape of what type of professional citizen you set out to be. And why support local? Because you, too, are local. This is your community, your city, and it is your interests that ought to be both heard and responded to, but it's not a one-way street. Be a citizen of Athens. Be engaged. Stop defining yourself as just a Bulldog. You've made this place your home, whether you recognize it or not.” — Kate Broome Dahlstrand, via Facebook“The people running these big businesses are not students and thus are not opening at these locations to ensure the quality of students' lives. Instead, they hope to feed of the naiveté of the students by using a household name to draw them in with trendy items. I encourage you to step out of your comfort zone. Take time to look at all of the wonderful, independent, creative, and supportive businesses holding this town up. As you pass by their windows on your way to Zaxby's or Starbucks, look at the flyers in the windows. You'll see that these small businesses are investing in the community.” — Christy Rogers, via email submission“A large percentage of businesses in this town were started by UGA students and recent graduates. That is one of the advantages of a town where the majority of the businesses are locally owned, and the rents are reasonable. It gives college students the opportunity to create their job instead of applying for one. The more corporate this town becomes, the fewer opportunities there will be for young entrepreneurs.” — Matt Linden, via redandblack.com‘A lot of us are … too broke … in a rush … or just don’t think about it.’Others who read the column argued that the choice to frequent big business chains stems more from convenience and time rather than an active decision against supporting local business. “I feel like a lot of us are either too broke for usually higher prices at small stores, in a rush and seriously don't have time to search out a small store and get stuff there instead of going to a chain that is usually very conveniently located along our usual route or just don't think about it.” — Ariel Brown, via Facebook“Coming from someone who lived in Kennesaw for years and has lived in Athens for one year, I refuse to go to Jittery Joe’s because its prices are much higher than Starbucks, the service is slow and the company doesn't make as much of a global influence. If we want to see how Athens will thrive, why not have as many big businesses and small businesses as possible and see who shops where. If small businesses want to show they can stand up against big businesses, then they should prove they can.” — Devin McLeod, via email submission


 


“I just want to know who put a Zaxby’s on Clayton Street in lieu of a Chick-fil-A.” — Cole Wilkes, via Facebook‘It is the small, local stores that made Athens unique.’Readers also felt that Athens' individualism as compared to the rest of the state is deeply rooted in local businesses. These businesses bring a certain charm to the area that is unlike what students will find in their hometowns.“I graduated in 1988 and loved Heery's Clothes Closet, the Flamingo Room, the milkshakes at The Grill, Classic's Sub Shop and so many more! It is the small, local stores that made Athens unique and not like any other town! These box places have a place on the outskirts of Athens but not anywhere near downtown or adjacent to campus!” — Mary Repko, via Facebook“I was at UGA from 1986-1990, and over the years, I have fondly remembered all the wonderful uniquely Athens businesses I supported. I remember how it felt to be there and how I couldn’t get this in Atlanta after I moved. They were local places you looked forward to coming back to after you left, made you remember the good old days and reminisce about being young and how great your time in Athens was. Luckily some of these places are still here and I love going back.”  — aleese44, via redandblack.com“Small town is what Athen's charm is all about.” — Melody Kidd Gunter, via Facebook‘Small businesses are the bridge between our purchases and opportunity to empower people.’Some readers, who also worked for small businesses in Athens, emphasized the philanthropy and community outreach local stores provide that big businesses don't.


TNCMS.AdManager.render({region: 'fixed-big-ad-bottom-asset', slot: 1, fold: ""below""});


“In my experience, as a business owner and as a consumer, the businesses here make Athens better. They create spaces and provide products with a name on them, not just a brand. Businesses of all kinds here, from fashion boutiques to coffee shops to hair salons, are contributing to incredibly important causes and organizations like AIDS Athens and Project Safe. I see so many of our small businesses as the bridge between our purchases and our opportunity to empower the people who need us most here.” — OH, via redandblack.com“Small businesses are nothing to turn your nose up at when it comes to their ability to create jobs and grow the local economy. Smart and forward-thinking policy-making, on the part of the local government, can protect and empower small businesses to compete against global behemoths like Starbucks. And there should be room for both in the local marketplace. But we shouldn't be flippant about the value of small businesses, even if we prefer a Frappuccino to a Frosty Joe. It's not just snobbery or a lingering anti-establishment ethos from Athens's bygone heyday as a weirdo capital of the South. It's also a reflection of how important it is to many of us to invest in Athenians first, to help our neighbors succeed in their dreams and to have accountability from the businesses we buy.” — rachellorenb, via redandblack.com‘The leadership in Athens has forgotten what makes a town unique’Keeping Athens insulated from big businesses was a strategic and deliberate choice, some readers argued. The infiltration of corporate chains, they wrote, is therefore the fault of local government officials.“The problem is that the local government has destroyed the tax base in the county by being anti-business for so long that nobody can remember it being any different. At this point, they have no choice but to embrace myopia for the simple need of tax revenue any way they can get it — culture and local flavor be damned.” — Joseph Samuel, via Facebook“The leadership in Athens has forgotten what makes a town unique, or just don't care in favor of money. At this point, I'm assuming the latter. Their plan seems to be to convert everything downtown into an upscale student oriented apartment complex playground/shopping mall, uniqueness be damned. No wonder there is an exodus of long time Athenian artists and creative types abandoning the escalating mediocrity that is quickly becoming downtown and making the trek northward, mostly because it's difficult to create culture for a student population that won't support it and just wants quick, convenient and trendy.” — Jeff Wood, via Facebook“You can be a citizen of Athens and support business. Athens is hostile for businesses. The chain stores are contributing to the economy, bringing in jobs, I really don't see what the problem is. Liberals in general are destroying the city. When there's progress everyone gets up in arms and attempts to stop it.” — Dee May, via Facebook“Students are here for only four years in most cases. Why should Athens change it's downtown flavor and appeal in order to make things more convenient for them? They can shop chain stores online or go to the Mall of Georgia to buy those fashions. Once these students graduate and work in the real world, they might appreciate the benefits of having unique shops and restaurants in Athens (or any town). For now they should not expect Athens to change in order to become just like many other towns in our country.” — NYCAGA, via redandblack.com",Staff Reports @redandblack,opinion,https://www.redandblack.com/opinion/opinion-is-local-always-better/article_d148a8cc-7202-11e6-ac3a-fb3c9ece477b.html
4-Sep-16,Georgia ranked second strictest state for DUI convictions,"In 2014, close to 10,000 people were killed in alcohol-related driving fatalities, on average one every 53 minutes, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.To combat these numbers, the state of Georgia is working to prevent these incidents.According to a recent ranking on Wallethub, Georgia is the second strictest state on DUI convictions. The website ranked each state based on its jail time given, the offense it becomes a felony, license suspension, minimum fine and mandatory alcohol assessment, among other qualifications.


 


“I’d like to be number one in order to get convictions and get people off the road to save somebody else’s life,” said Lt. Don Eckert of the Athens-Clarke County Police Department.According to the rankings, Georgia enacts a minimum of ten days jail time for first conviction and minimum of ninety days for a second conviction. It is also the only state to suspend licenses for an entire year.Athens-Clarke County has had its fair share of DUI related incidents.Eckert said there were 198 alcohol related collisions and 533 people were arrested from DUI in 2015.Athens criminal defense lawyer Kim Stephens said the incidents comprise 30 to 40 percent of cases he handles.533 people were arrested from DUI in 2015Lt. Don Eckert


 


“Athens in particular is probably the worst place in the state to get a DUI,” Stephens said. “The police are much less flexible due to the young people in the area that run into trouble.”Students at the University of Georgia have often contributed to the yearly number of cases. In July 2016, UGA football defensive lineman Jonathan Ledbetter was one of these cases.According to a police report, Ledbetter fell asleep at the wheel and blocked traffic at the intersection between Lexington and Barnett Shoals roads. Ledbetter reportedly had a blood alcohol content six times the legal limit of 0.02 for someone under the age of 21.Eckert said the average BAC of offenders in 2015 was 0.14, and the highest was 0.34.Ledbetter was later released on a $2,000 bond and suspended for the first two football games of the season.“Ultimately we’d like to have it where nobody gets behind the wheel and drive impaired.”

-Lt. Don Eckert, Athens-Clarke County police “For our arrest and conviction rate, I think we’re doing the best with what we have and where we should be,” Eckert said. “Ultimately we’d like to have it where nobody gets behind the wheel and drive impaired.”Some bars in the downtown area, such as Cutter’s Pub on Clayton Street, make sure their customers are capable of driving before they exit the premises, according to UGA senior and bartender Paden Janney.“We try to make sure people are cut off when they've had too much, and we always ask people that are our regulars if they've gotten an Uber or if they need to wait for a ride,” she said. “Each person that comes in the bar is our responsibility, so it's pretty serious serving drinks.”Of the nearly 10,000 alcohol-related driving fatalities in 2014, Georgia experienced 278 of the incidents, according to the Foundation for Advancing Alcohol Responsibility.At the county level, Athens-Clarke County experienced 15 fatalities in 2015, with 11 related to DUIs, Eckert said.

Athens-Clarke County experienced 15 DUI fatalities in 2015 Lt. Don Eckert “To me a DUI is no different than any other violent crime,"" he said. ""I’ve seen too many deaths over the years from people who shouldn’t have been behind the wheel at all.""Eckert said he urges those who consume any alcohol, no matter the amount, to stay where they are or to get a ride in order to save a life.“There are so many ways to avoid drinking and driving now, so they never have to meet me,” Stephens said.","Savannah Peat

5-Sep-16,"GroupMe, communication apps clash with UGA's academic honesty policy","As classes begin to pick up speed, students face an increasing amount of work, as they are expected to turn in assignments, finish homework, work on group projects and study for tests and quizzes.With such a heavy workload, students often seek the help of the peers by forming study groups or study sessions.“UGA students are frequently encouraged to develop study groups and share notes, but it is always best to check with the instructor,” said Deborah C. Bell, the director of student academic honesty at the University of Georgia. 


 


In this age of technology, students can instead use apps or text messaging in order to communicate about classes or assignments. One particularly popular app students use is GroupMe.“I use GroupMe for classes like biology and chemistry, where there are over 100 students in the lecture,” said Mansi Mehta, a sophomore from Suwanee.The app allows individuals to create a group, invite others to join, and message with those in the group.Many students may create a GroupMe for a specific class and use the app to ask other students about due dates, instructions for class assignments, or even help with studying.“I use GroupMe for classes in order to ask questions that others might know and just reminders of things I might have missed or couldn’t attend,” said Oohaa Vennapusa, a sophomore from Johns Creek. For Mehta, the convenience of the app is what draws her to using it.“GroupMe helps me with classes in the fact that it is easy and convenient for me to send a question or an explanation for someone else, and it has a quick response rate since so many people are in the group at once,” she said.However, GroupMe and other mass messaging apps can contribute to a violation the academic honesty policy by allowing students a way of cheating.


 


“I have been using GroupMe less this semester, because I heard about a cheating scandal for CHEM 1212 last semester where someone sent out the answers to a lab practical in the GroupMe, implicating over 300 people for cheating,” Mehta said.Though UGA’s Academic Honesty Policy, A Culture of Honesty, does not specifically mention forms of social media like GroupMe or Facebook, the misuse of apps like GroupMe would fall under the definition of unauthorized assistance.The Academic Honesty Policy states that ""during examinations, quizzes, lab work, and similar activity, students are to assume that any assistance (such as books, notes, calculators, and conversations with others) is unauthorized unless it has been specifically authorized by an instructor.”“If an instructor is concerned that a student, or students, have either given or received unauthorized assistance, each student involved would normally be reported,"" Bell said. “The first step in the university’s resolution process is a facilitated discussion which is a time for the instructor and student to meet with a facilitator to discuss the instructor’s concerns.”In Spring of 2015, 229 students were reported for academic dishonesty, according to the Office of the Vice President for Instruction.“There are 4 possible outcomes from a facilitated discussion,” Bell said. “One, the instructor and student agree there is no violation. Two, the instructor and student agree there is a violation. Three, there is not agreement on the sanction for a violation. Or four, there is not agreement on whether or not a violation occurred.”Of the 229 reports in the spring, 62 percent were related to issues of unauthorized assistance.“I think if students misuse social media apps to cheat, the integrity of a University of Georgia degree is compromised,” Bell said. “In other words, a student who cheats in any manner is not earning a UGA degree, and I hope that our students would agree.”


TNCMS.AdManager.render({region: 'fixed-big-ad-bottom-asset', slot: 1, fold: ""below""});

5-Sep-16,Georgia women's soccer falls to Iowa State 2-0 in Auburn Soccer Classic,"There was a sense of offensive dominance for Georgia women's soccer, but it was unable to find a victory in the Auburn Soccer Classic as Iowa State defeated the Bulldogs 2-0 on Sept. 4.The ball was mostly possessed by the Bulldogs (2-3-1) throughout the first 20 minutes of play, and Georgia accumulated more shots on goal than the Cyclones (4-1-0). However, Iowa State was the first to find the back of the net when it took a 1-0 lead in 24th minute.Georgia may have dominated the first half, but despite a total of 12 shots, Iowa State was able to hold the lead at halftime with only one shot on goal out of three total shots.


 


In the first ten minutes of the second half, Georgia collected three shots. Junior Becca Rasmussen got things going, but her efforts fell short as her shot sailed just above the crossbar. Senior Marion Crowder also had some chances of her own. One stemmed from senior Lauren Tanner's setup that resulted in an elevated shot.All was fair play until the 87th minute when Cyclones' Hannah Cade went one-on-one with Georgia goalkeeper Louise Hogrell. Hogrell lost that challenge as Iowa State extended its lead to 2-0.","Jacob Stansell

10-Sep-16,UGA Health Center displays range of services at Healthy Dawg Kickoff,"Fall is fast approaching, and with it, so is cold and flu season. In an effort to give students the necessary tools to combat these illnesses, the University Health Center hosted its annual Healthy Dawg Kickoff Thursday, Sept. 8.Interactive booths from clinics and student groups lined the health center as students were lead through all three stories of the building in a scavenger hunt-style quest to locate all of the health center’s available services.Students received a punch card upon arrival that served as their key to get prizes and enter into a drawing.


 


Kristine Groft, the senior communications coordinator for the UHC, said the event was meant to help students get acclimated with these services.“We have services ranging from physical to mental health, including programs for wellness, nutrition, sexual health and even socializing,” she said. “What we want people to know is that if they need anything in regards to balancing out their life, the Health Center is the place to go.”Fiona Sullivan is a health promotions major that works as a healthy dawg ambassador. At the event, Sullivan served by passing out bags full of healthy snacks and information about the health center's services. She said having a central location for these services has helped her efficiently take care of herself within her busy lifestyle.“I’m out of state, so having everything in one central location helps,” she said. “There have been days when I’ve gone from CAPS to the Women’s Clinic to Primary Care all in one day — and within two hours.”Whether students utilize them or not, there is a demand for the resources, as many students may find themselves in need of medical assistance during their time at UGA.A4: Come by #HealthyDawg Kick-off before the first #UGA home game - see your health center & pick up some prizes! pic.twitter.com/a7VTHq4Gxo— Healthy Dawg (@UGAhealthcenter) July 14, 2016According to the American College Health Association's National College Health Assessment in spring 2015, 15 percent of students reported in the past 12 months a cold, flu and sore throat negatively affecting their individual academic performance, said Dr. Carlo Ciotoli, the associate vice president at the New York University Student Health Center.


 


Some students at the event were unaware of the services the health center offers.Sophomores Sarah Bock and Tiffany Garnace paused for a picture with Hairy Dawg before turning in their completed punch cards. In visiting all of the stations, the girls located some newfound resources.“I was unaware that there was a center just for women,” Garnace said. “They offer all these contraceptives and pills, which I didn’t know they offered before. I also didn’t know there was a vision clinic. As a person that wears glasses and contacts, it’s nice to know I can actually buy my contacts here instead of going all the way home just to fill out a prescription.”Bock’s said her favorite part of the event was the free health-related goodies.""One of the most interesting things they gave us for free is this thermometer that will change colors based on your symptoms to let you know if you have a flu or cold,” Bock said.Several booths at the event spoke to all the different forms living the lifestyle of a 'healthy dawg' can take. Jordan Dailey, a member of the student group Peer Nutrition Educators, spoke to what the lifestyle meant to her.“One thing I think is cool is being healthy at every size,” she said. “Health isn’t black and white. It’s about moderation and knowing that you can enjoy treats every now and then.”

22-Sep-16,Fourth and Eason: Freshman quarterback takes control of Georgia's offense at Missouri,"After three straight incomplete passes, Jacob Eason, Georgia’s offense and the game’s outcome stood on the 20-yard line with less than two minutes on the clock. On a fourth-and-10 pass to the end zone, Eason connected with Isaiah McKenzie.The freshman quarterback ran to join the celebration near the goal post before holding a Trent Frix snap for a William Ham extra-point kick. Georgia beat Missouri by one point.“That’s what you play for,” said Lew Widmann, who was Eason’s quarterbacks coach at Lake Stevens High School. “Any guy that believes in himself is going to want to be in that situation.”


 


It was only a single pass, but it carried significant weight. On the road at Eason’s first Southeastern Conference matchup, the 18-year-old quarterback delivered. Georgia remained undefeated.“That’s what you play for. Any guy that believes in himself is going to want to be in that situation.”Lew Widmann, who was Eason’s quarterbacks coach at Lake Stevens High SchoolIt’s the reason a packed Sanford Stadium erupted when Eason, then the third-string quarterback, trotted onto the field at the G-Day spring scrimmage. It’s the reason fans panicked when Eason visited the University of Florida after the firing of Georgia head coach Mark Richt.“He’s gotten some valuable experience the last three games, but let’s be honest, he’s a freshman,” head coach Kirby Smart said.Eason will be tested again this weekend in Oxford, Mississippi, against an Ole Miss team that already has losses against Florida State and Alabama. In both matchups, the Rebels led by at least 20 points at a time during the game.


 


Georgia’s win over Missouri was the first time Eason played the entire game. On this week’s depth chart, Eason’s name was not accompanied by an “or,” meaning his chance of starting is not being shared with senior Greyson Lambert.

“Jacob’s going to be able to start our game,” Smart said. “Assuming he has a good week of practice, he will. That’s the plan going forward. If he continues to practice well and do the right things, then he’ll be the starter.” Lambert started in the Bulldogs’ first game against UNC, while Eason got the job against Nicholls State. Still, Lambert was the quarterback of choice when the game was on the line in the final minutes. Against Missouri, however, the offense belonged to Eason. Still, there are plenty of experiences Eason has yet to encounter. “He’s shown the propensity that when he makes a mistake once he can usually correct that,” Smart said. “But you’re talking about exponentially how many things can happen in a play that he’s never seen and now you’re trying to fix all those things.” With 131 passing yards in Georgia’s opener, 204 in the second week and 308 against Missouri, Eason’s statistics are climbing upward, mostly because his playing time each game has increased.“He’s a great leader,” offensive lineman Lamont Gaillard said of Eason, who is not available to the media, as Smart cites a policy that prohibits freshmen from talking to reporters. “He is doing whatever he can to help the team and we’re going to need him for that.”

“He’s a great leader. He is doing whatever he can to help the team and we’re going to need him for that.” Lamont Gaillard, offensive linemanGaillard said Eason was calm in the huddle prior to the final touchdown. Eason simply told the group, “Let’s get this touchdown,” according to Gaillard. Eason’s demeanor has long been that way — never overexcited, never too down, but always competitive, Widmann said. “We would have pre-game meetings, and I would almost have to go over and say, ‘Do you have a pulse? Are you there?’” Widmann said. “He was just so calm and cool. It was like he was going to work.”Widmann could only remember one high school game where Eason was in a similar situation to win the game as he was on Saturday. Against Edmonds-Woodway, a story similar to last weekend unfolded, just with a younger Eason and a different team. 

In a shootout against a rival team, Eason, a high school sophomore at the time, threw a touchdown pass that won the playoff game with about a minute remaining.

But plays like that weren’t normally needed during Eason’s high school career. Lake Stevens typically “won by such a wide margin his junior and senior year,” Widmann said, so Eason wasn’t in many game-on-the-line scenarios. Fourth downs, on the other hand, are a comfortable situation for the quarterback. During his senior year, Lake Stevens went for 14 fourth-down conversions, sometimes even inside its own 20-yard line, according to Widmann. Eason, who was also the team’s punter, only kicked the ball away about 11 times. On those plays, he said Eason’s behavior didn’t change. It was like a normal day. And when Widmann saw McKenzie’s route develop with Eason in a similar setting on Saturday, he said he thought it would turn out well for his former pupil.“I wish I could really say I was surprised,” said Widmann, who leapt out of his chair when Eason completed the pass. “But I wasn’t.”","Emily Giambalvo

23-Sep-16,Georgia equestrian ‘hungry’ for title this season,"After an upsetting end to last year’s season, the Georgia equestrian team is ready to make a comeback. The team is set on winning a title this season.The team won its sixth NCEA national title in 2014 and its first Southeastern Conference title in 2015. Last season, the team won neither.The Red and Black Scrimmage on Saturday is an opportunity for the riders to get opinions from judges. Feedback from the scrimmage will gauge how ready the team is for this season. 


 


“There’s no better way to get ready than being in situations where you have the real limits on you,"" head coach Meghan Boenig said.Meg O’Mara, a senior and a captain, said she was disappointed with not winning a title last season. For many seniors, such as O’Mara, the loss was surprising.“We kind of always expect a championship, and we just let a few things slide through the cracks,” O’Mara said. “It didn’t turn out the way we wanted it to so we’re definitely hungry this year.”For the seniors who had the opportunity to be a part of both wins, this is their last chance to win a title in college. For the freshmen, however, this will be their first time competing in college. The seniors are guiding the other riders, which has kept the team motivated. Guiding the freshmen through their first competitive experiences in college has been a main focus. Allie Harbert said she is ready for her last year at Georgia. As a senior and a captain, Harbert said she is looking forward to leaving behind a legacy and having the freshmen follow in her footsteps. 


 


Last season was the first time Harbert didn’t win a title with the Georgia equestrian team.“Everyone’s wanting to come back from last year with something to prove,” Harbert said. “It’s made us more focused for the start of this year than we’ve ever been.”Boenig, however, said she doesn’t believe that this season’s concentration is any different than last season. If anything, she said the loss has “sharpened the focus.”“We have to continue to invest in ourselves and find those moments at that sustainable level,” Boenig said. “If we do, that’s going to be unstoppable.”Boenig said she believes that having a single goal to win a national title is too vague. It’s critical that the team focuses on the present, whether it be practice or school. The team is hoping to come out on top and prove themselves. Its dedication to practice, working out and school is a strength Boenig believes will lead to Georgia's success this season.“That’s the end result,” Boenig said. “But if you don’t do the process in between and put the right ingredients in that’s never going to happen.”",Nikki Weldon @bonechip,sports,https://www.redandblack.com/sports/georgia-equestrian-hungry-for-title-this-season/article_1b9e31be-8133-11e6-8fe5-d719ef096230.html
23-Sep-16,Athens community gathers at UGA Arch for Black Lives Matter vigil,"Close to 100 people gathered in front the University of Georgia Arch Friday evening in protest against police brutality and injustice against African Americans, and to show solidarity for the cause of Black Lives Matter.The protests come after two separate incidents where black men were fatally shot by police officers. Terence Crutcher was killed Sept. 16 in Tulsa, Oklahoma, and Keith Lamont Scott was killed Sept. 20 in Charlotte, North Carolina, the latter of which sparked violent protests in the city.Members of several different Athens organizations participated in the demonstration, including the Unitarian Universalist Fellowship of Athens, the Economic Justice Coalition, Athens for Everyone, the Athens branch of the NAACP and the Athens Anti-Discrimination Movement. Some of the organizations took the opportunity to promote the establishment of an Athens Civil Rights Committee, referring to the proposed Athens-Clarke County ordinance aimed at combating discrimination at downtown bars.


 


Over the course of the hour-long vigil, several people spoke to the crowd, including Mokah Jasmine Johson, co-founder of the Athens Anti-Discrimination Movement.  Johnson, along with her husband Knowa Johnson, have been working with the community officials in an effort to improve the lives of African-Americans in Athens. The two organized the anti-discrimination march in January that brought the issue of discrimination in downtown Athens to the forefront.“We get together with commissioners,” Knowa Johnson said. “We try to get together with the mayor. We try to work together on legislation. We try to have a voice in the situation.”Mokah Johnson spoke of her stepson who was shot and killed a few years ago, and about the injustice they are trying to fight.

“We want to act like racism don’t exist. We want to act like black men and women are treated equally and are on an equal playing field. That is a lie,"" she said. ""I am a black woman with a black son. As a matter of fact, my stepson got shot and killed a few years ago. They still didn’t find his killer. That resonates in my heart.”The speakers were not the only voices heard at the event, however.Dante Tercha, an African-American man, stood at the Arch holding a sign with the words “Make America Great Again"" written on it. During the event, Tercha talked to people on the edges of the crowd, arguing against the points he believed the protestors were trying to make, and arguing against other unfairness in the system.


 


Though the conversations between Tercha and others became argumentative at times, the discussions remained civil, which was how Tercha said he hoped the conversations would be.“Yes, I started off a little abrasive and aggressive in order to gain attention, only because that’s the tactic I learned from the left,” he said.  “Once I had enough peaceful and sincere people in line to hear my message, I want to simply make clear that black lives matter.  All lives matter.""Tercha said he wanted clarification when it came to how the Black Lives Matter movement portrayed law enforcement.

""Everyone deserves equal protection under the law.  There are bad actors in the police force. There are bad actors in authority,"" he said.

25-Sep-16,Equestrian scrimmage gives riders chance to prepare for season,"While she was on her way to Saturday's equestrian scrimmage, freshman rider Maddy Darst thought to herself, “I forgot my belt."" The morning of Darst’s first equestrian meet in college started off somewhat hectic. She knew she didn’t have time to waste. Darst left her belt behind in hopes of finding a solution when she arrived at the facility. After searching in her car, she came across a belt she had forgotten about. 


 


Darst may have forgotten her belt Saturday morning, but she sure didn’t forget how to ride in her events. Saturday’s Red and Black scrimmage concluded with the red team winning overall in both the hunt seat and western events. The red team won 6-4 in hunt seat and 7-2 in western. Seventeen freshmen competed. The scrimmage was the first opportunity for the freshmen to prepare themselves for the scrimmage next Saturday against Alabama. Darst, on the red team, had the highest score in equitation over fences with a 77. She earned the only point for the red team in that event. She also tied with freshman rider Gracie Bridges and sophomore rider Alexis Mougalian for the highest score in equitation on the flat with an 83.“I was pretty confident coming in,” Darst said. Darst believes there’s room for improvement. She said she needs to continue riding smoothly along with keeping her legs from swinging as she rides. Half of the riders who competed on Saturday were freshmen. Head coach Meghan Boenig believes that the freshmen competed well with very few errors.“Seeing them perform strongly is very indicative of good things to come,” Boenig said. 


 


The black team, however, had some trouble throughout the western events. Three scores of zero were given to riders during the western events. Simple mistakes were made that Boenig believes are fixable.Senior rider Charley Thiel, on the black team, believes the zeros that were given had nothing to do with any of the riders forgetting the pattern. “We need to focus on keeping our nerves down and our confidence up,” Thiel said.Thiel also won the highest score overall for the reining event with a 72.5.In the horsemanship event, junior rider Payton Anderson, on the red team, won the highest score overall with a 74. Anderson believes that the freshmen competing in the horsemanship event have impressed the other riders with the way they’ve jumped right in. The older riders appreciate the work ethic and talent the freshmen possess.“The atmosphere this team has this season is unreal,” Anderson said. “Everyone is so positive. I think we’re going to hit the ground running.”",Nikki Weldon @bonechip,sports,https://www.redandblack.com/sports/equestrian-scrimmage-gives-riders-chance-to-prepare-for-season/article_fae274e0-8389-11e6-ac6e-47f25508ad31.html
25-Sep-16,Georgia volleyball loses to another SEC opponent,"Georgia volleyball fell again this afternoon to another conference opponent. The Bulldogs were swept by Tennessee 3-0 in Knoxville.The team played neck-to-neck in the second and third set losing 25-21.“We had some moments of nice rhythm, but it's hard to compete with anyone in the SEC with the number of errors we had today,"" head coach Lizzy Stemke said. 


 


Georgia’s first set against the Volunteers ended poorly with a score of 25-14 which made it hard for the Bulldogs to come back in the next two sets.Although Kendall Kazor had a 5-0 killing spree, it wasn't enough for the Bulldogs to recapture the win. The Volunteers came back to lead 16-15 in the second set. Majesti Bass was the star of the match today leading with eight kills along with Meghan Donovan who had 23 assists. The Bulldogs lost to Kentucky this past week as well away for their first two matches of the Southeastern conference.On Friday at home, the team will take on Alabama on Friday following Auburn on Sunday to hopefully win some conference play. ""First week on the road was not successful in the way we would like to be competing but we will get back to the gym this week with more urgency to raise our level and find more ways to score,"" Stemke said.",Mary Ramsaier @Itsmaroula,sports,https://www.redandblack.com/sports/georgia-volleyball-loses-to-another-sec-opponent/article_94e087de-8390-11e6-887d-4be9975f5f58.html

“There’s a chain of survival in these situations, and response time is a critical part of that chain,” said Sam Rafal, a long-time EMT and middle school science teacher. “But a chain is only as strong as its weakest link, and this link is broken.” Rafal was an EMT for 30 years, but said he left his position with National EMS, the private EMS company contracted by Athens Regional Medical Center and St. Mary’s Hospital since 2009, after he became frustrated with their treatment of emergency calls. He has since advocated for faster EMS response times.The NFPA 1710, a code issued by the National Fire Protection Association to standardize emergency responses nationwide, dictates that EMS must respond within eight minutes 90 percent of the time on advanced life services calls and within four minutes 90 percent of the time for basic life services. Bob Gadd, a paramedic in Madison County and a former employee of National EMS, said the issue of response times needs to be addressed.

“We just need to get information from people on the streets that we do really have a problem,” he said. At the same time, Rafal said he has seen improvement in recent years. “From a historical perspective, we have come a long way from February 2012 when the UGA student was hit by car on Milledge Avenue and lay critically injured for 12 minutes without a professional medical response,” he said.


 


In a previous Red & Black article following the 2012 incident, Robby Atkins, the director of operations for National EMS, said the response time to which Rafal is referring does not actually reflect how fast EMS responded, since the call first went through Clarke County Office of Emergency Communications before being directed to EMS.Don Cargile, the community relations director for National EMS, said he has heard Rafal’s concerns before.“We have not received any complaints from patients about the response time,” he said. “We have received third-party concerns, and we are working to get to the bottom of them.”As far as National EMS response times, Cargile said the company is within its goal.“Our goal is eight minutes in Clarke County, and right now we’re averaging 7.87 minutes,” he said. “Our goal is eight minutes in Clarke County, and right now we’re averaging 7.87 minutes.""

-Don Cargile, community relations director for National EMSWhen asked how National EMS is working to reduce their response time, Cargile said preparation is crucial.“Response is one key element to patient care,” he said. “But what you do before the call and after that call is just as important.”To reduce response times, Cargile said the company’s eight to 12 ambulances “are always moving during peak times.” The vehicles will also position themselves in specific areas during certain times, such as in downtown during the weekends. When not patrolling, vehicles are based at two National EMS stations, he said.","Nick Seymour and Nate Harris

30-Sep-16,Scouting Report: Tennessee,"Coming into the 2016 season, Tennessee was widely regarded as the favorite to win the SEC East. But it struggled to open the season. The Volunteers squeaked out a pair of wins over Appalachian State and Ohio University, and they fell behind early to Virginia Tech before pulling away in the second half.Tennessee also fell behind 21-0 last week to Florida, and it looked as if the team was heading toward a 12th straight loss to the Gators. But unlike the last 11 years, the Vols roared past Florida in the second half. They scored 35 unanswered points for a 38-28 win.

Now, Tennessee is once again being looked at as the team to beat in the East. This Saturday, it heads to Athens to face a Georgia team that is reeling following a 45-14 loss to Ole Miss. This game will have major implications in the SEC race, and Tennessee is the team that appears to have all the momentum. The Volunteer offense is led by senior quarterback Josh Dobbs. He hasn’t improved as a passer as much as some thought he would coming into the year, but he has still been solid. Dobbs has amassed 805 yards passing with 10 touchdowns. But he has been a little careless with the ball, throwing five interceptions and making throws that a senior quarterback just shouldn’t make.

Dobbs has also been a threat on the ground. He’s picked up 241 rushing yards and four touchdowns in four games this season. The running game is led by a pair of junior running backs: Jalen Hurd and Alvin Kamara. Hurd is more of a physical, downhill runner, while Kamara is more of an elusive back. Hurd has contributed 365 yards and two touchdowns, while Kamara has chipped in 103 yards on 22 carries. Between this duo and Dobbs, the Vols average 186.5 rushing yards per game.The receiving corps doesn’t have one big target to go to, instead operating in a by-committee approach. The top seven in receptions range from 13 catches for junior receiver Josh Malone to four receptions out of the backfield for Hurd. Malone has had a knack for finding the end zone so far, as five of his 13 receptions have gone for scores. Much of Tennessee’s early-season struggles were attributed to the play of the offensive line. Even though four starters returned from last year’s team, the line just could not get anything done up front early on. This was especially true in the season opener against Appalachian State where the Vols averaged less than three yards per carry. The performance has improved as the season has worn on, but there are still question marks for head coach Butch Jones and the Tennessee coaching staff.

The front seven is anchored by junior defensive end Derek Barnett and senior linebacker Jalen Reeves-Maybin. So far, Barnett has amassed six tackles for loss and two sacks. However, the five sacks from the defense as a whole ranks 12th in the conference. The rushing defense has been middle of the pack, allowing 141 yards on the ground per game.The passing defense has been similarly average, placing 54th in the country allowing 212 passing yards per game. Tennessee is, however, without their top corner, senior Cam Sutton. In their first full game without Sutton, the Tennessee defense surrendered 296 yards through the air to Florida’s backup quarterback Austin Appleby. For Georgia, it will come down to which Tennessee team shows up on Saturday. If it’s the team that played against Appalachian State and in the first half against Florida, then the Bulldogs have a good chance. But if the Volunteers play lights out like they did in the second half against Virginia Tech and Florida, then it could be a long afternoon for Kirby Smart and the Bulldogs.","Jed May

1-Oct-16,Georgia volleyball loses 3rd straight SEC match,"Georgia lost its third conference match Friday night against Alabama, 3-1. After two sets going into extra points, the Bulldogs fell short in both sets which costed them the match. Even with Caroline Ostman’s double-double performance of 11 kills and 11 digs, the Bulldogs couldn’t clutch the win.Ostman rallied the third set with back-to-back kills that motivated the team to win 25-21 after losing their first two sets. Ostman’s strong presence on the court allowed Georgia to set up the plays they needed. During the fourth match, Ostman fell down on her ankle and was carried off the court. Ostman stayed on the sidelines instead of heading back to the locker room to catch the end of the set. “I wasn’t surprised to see her out there,” Kazor said. “She didn’t even pity herself and went straight to cheering her head off.” 


 


Maddie Lobenstien led in kills with 18, along with Kendall Kazor with 12 kills. Kazor had the highest hitting percentage of the night of .476.Georgia fought back and forth within three points for the first match. Between the 20th point to the 30th point of the set, it was a dog-and-cat chase. Alabama clutched the win for the first set of the match 32-28. “We have to make sure we are executing the little details as we move forward,” Lobenstein said. “We have to be more aggressive with our blocking.” A light shined on the Georgia Bulldogs at half time. They came out from the locker room and won 25-21 in the third set.“We are fighting incredibly hard,” head coach Lizzy Stemke said. “We missed some executions here and there, which we ended up needing at the end of sets.”The Bulldogs take on Auburn on Sunday afternoon again at home. They will push to gain their first conference win since 2014.“Even if we hit all marks tonight and got the loss, it still doesn’t feel as bad if we didn’t hit our marks and got the loss,” Lobenstein said.",Mary Ramsaier @Itsmaroula,sports,https://www.redandblack.com/sports/georgia-volleyball-loses-rd-straight-sec-match/article_014996fa-87dc-11e6-a78f-0382c3fd8edd.html
2-Oct-16,Georgia cross country competes in Paul Short Run,"Bryan Kamau and Jessica Drop have been the Georgia cross country team’s best runners so far this season. In the first two meets of the season, they led the way on the men’s and women’s side, respectively.That trend held true this weekend when the team competed in the Paul Short Run, hosted by Lehigh University. Kamau finished eighth in the men’s 8K race with a time of 23:52, which is the best of his career. In her first career 6K race, Drop finished third with a time of 20:13.“I was very happy with how both teams performed this morning,” head coach Patrick Cunniff said. “They handled the size of the meet and the level of competition well.  I think our whole crew competed hard and made progress.”


 


The men finished 10th out of 38 teams while the women finished 13th out of 47 teams.For the men, three runners finished in the top-20 of the 336-man field. Following junior Kamau, junior Austin Sprague and senior Sid Vaughn posted times of 23:59 and 24:02 to finish 16th and 18th in the race.“The highlight of the meet was probably having three men in the top-20,” Cunniff said.On the women’s side, it was a trio of freshmen to cross the finish line first for the Bulldogs. Behind Jessica Drop, Sam Drop crossed the line at 20:50, and Yanely Gomez came in at 21:34.For the Drop sisters, this is the third straight race that the two have scored for Georgia. Gomez scored in the first race, but an injury kept her from running in Nashville at the second meet.“Jessica ran one of the best races we have seen in the University of Georgia cross country program,” Cunniff said. “Her finish is an outstanding sign, especially since this was the first 6K of her life and against the biggest field of her life.”The Bulldogs have their last meet of the regular season at Alabama on Oct. 14.",Zach Shugan @ZachShugan,sports,https://www.redandblack.com/sports/georgia-cross-country-competes-in-paul-short-run/article_c8a879b8-88e1-11e6-80ab-13db75210eed.html
2-Oct-16,Maria Taylor leaves lasting impression on a Georgia volleyball player,"Former Bulldog Maria Taylor has left a lasting mark on Georgia despite leaving the university over seven years ago. In fact, one Georgia volleyball player, Majesti Bass, looks up to Taylor. Taylor attended Georgia from 2005-2009 playing for the basketball team and volleyball team. Besides being named Southeastern Conference Player of the Week five times, Taylor holds multiple records in program history. Her best record sits on the kills’ list. With 1,729 kills, Taylor lands the fourth spot of all time at Georgia.“Georgia volleyball was the beginning,” Taylor said. “First thing I did on camera was a volleyball match.”


 


Not only does Taylor thrive on the volleyball court, she excels on the set of SEC Nation along with Marcus Spears, Laura Rutledge, Tim Tebow and Paul Finebaum.After studying and graduating from Grady College, Taylor pursued her journalism career.She said Grady helped her to become the journalist she is today. While Taylor was on campus Friday, she visited two classes and spoke with them.Taylor caught up with old professors such as David Hazinski whom she respected and who told her there wasn’t any money in sports journalism when she was a student.“A guy that sat there and told me it’s going to be difficult,” Taylor said. “I think what Grady did it told me the truth on what it was going to be like when I got in the real world — never held anything back.”The life lessons she learned has carried her through her career. When she travels every week to a different school, she strives to speak to every volleyball team. Volleyball is grounded close to her heart. Sharing her experiences with young athletes like Bass is important to her.“Enjoy the little moments they have with their teammates right now,” Taylor said. “Whatever seems like a problem — forget that — these girls are going to be their friends for life. I tell them things I would’ve told Maria if she was still in Georgia.”As for Bass, she wants to be Maria Taylor’s protégé as head coach Lizzy Stemke said. Taylor has visited the team a few times when she pops into Athens.


 


“Every time she comes to town, she contacts us,” Stemke said. “She has a lot of pride for this place.”When Bass was a little girl, she used to set all of her stuffed animals in a row —like an audience. She would talk into a pretend microphone for her television show. Now, she wants to be Maria Taylor.“All of her accolades and accomplishments that she had while she was here was a great legacy that’s left here,” Bass said. “I know all the girls are trying to live up to that.”","Mary Ramsaier

3-Oct-16,UGA students 'pray for peace' in national community,"Close to 60 students gathered in the amphitheater behind the Zell B. Miller Learning Center at the University of Georgia Sunday evening to pray for peace and promote police-community relations, in light of national protests following recent police shootings.Ammishaddai Grand-Jean, a sophomore from Jonesboro studying political science and economics, organized the event.“With all the recent events that have been happening as far as the shootings with civilians, and even shootings of officers, to the distrust between civilians and officers, to the riots, to the hatred, to pain, I was wondering what to do,” Grand-Jean said. “I kept asking God ‘What should we do?’ and something told me ‘Why don’t you just pray?’""


 


For some students like Amber Cathey, a math education major from Lawrenceville, prayer serves to comfort the community.“Prayer makes things make sense and puts things in terms of eternity, and some people say prayer makes things smaller, but I think prayer makes things doable,” she said. “It can also lead to a lot of peace outside yourself, just in your own actions towards others and the community around you.”Students at the event stood on the ledges, rocking back and forth as a band played Christian songs related to God and the power of prayer.For Sloane Shuler, a junior studying communication from Atlanta, prayer is stronger when done in a group.“It’s just very encouraging to be able to see other people coming together and praying,” she said. “For me personally, I get to see other believers. It’s like I see a physical representation of the God who is not physical.""The student organizers said one of the main goals of the vigil was to bring together people of all backgrounds.“We really want to stress having more than just African Americans. We wanted to have a diverse crowd, that I think we’ve done successfully, and just encourage each other,” said Zari Wilson, a senior from Duluth studying mass media arts who created fliers for the event. ""It’s not being black or white or Asian or Hispanic. It’s a matter of we are all believing this one thing. We are all coming together in standing in that gap for each other.""


 


Grand-Jean said he hopes praying for peace will bring together the Christian community not only at UGA, but eventually the nation.“The idea came to bring all races, all people from UGA who all believe in God, and pray, and we ask for guidance and instruction,” he said. “At the same time we can have a better relationship with each other, and soon it can spread out to the nation.”","Maxime Tamsett

4-Oct-16,Mayor Denson places anti-discrimination ordinance back on agenda after Athens citizens march on city hall,"Athens Mayor Nancy Denson announced Tuesday night at the Athens-Clarke County Commission meeting that the anti-discrimination bar admittance ordinance would be back on the agenda in November, to cheers from a large crowd which had gathered inside city hall.The anti-discrimination ordinance is the result of a commission-passed resolution in January, a survey regarding discrimination conducted by members of the University of Georgia Student Government Association and months of citizen input and legislative review. In its latest form, the ordinance would require bars to post their dress code near their doors and keep records of all private events. It also would allow citizens to report acts of discrimination to the county attorney.The commission meeting began with members of the Athens Anti-Discrimination Movement and concerned citizens marching on city hall from the UGA Arch. As they converged on City Hall, their singing could be heard from outside the commission chamber. Due to the noise, various announcements from the month's commission meeting were moved to November. Mayor Denson attempted multiple times to quiet the crowd, which extended out into the hallway of the building, and was met by a few jeers from the audience.


 


“That’s what your intercom is for,"" said one woman sitting in the crowd. ""[The marchers] aren’t loud enough, if you ask me.""Denson was able to calm the crowd by announcing the anti-discrimination bar admittance ordinance would be added back to the agenda next month, after being pulled from the agenda for two consecutive months.Athens Mayor Nancy Denson announced the anti-discrimination bar ordinance will go back on the agenda next month @redandblack— John Hammel (@jp_hammel) October 4, 2016In a statement released in September, Denson announced she had pulled the ordinance from the September agenda, citing the possible expansion of the ordinance to encompass restaurants that make more than 50 percent of their sales in alcohol as well. In her statement, Denson said the delay would allow local restaurant owners an opportunity for citizen input before the ordinance goes to vote.After the crowd settled down, the mayor and commission commenced with their usual monthly meeting and briefly ran through the items on the agenda before opening the floor up to citizen input.What followed was approximately an hour and a half of testimony from Athens locals mostly concerning the creation of a Civil Rights Committee, which the Athens Anti-Discrimination Movement would like to see created. At the meeting, Jasmine Mokah Johnson said the civil rights committee would serve as a liaison between the people and the government in matters of discrimination.Adding to the unusual circumstances of the October commission meeting, Denson broke the usual procedures of commission meetings by opening up a dialogue with Cathy Woolard, the former Atlanta city council president, during the citizen input time. Woolard was city council president of Atlanta when the city created its own civil rights committee, the only one in the state, 15 years ago. Woolard is currently running for mayor of Atlanta.


 


“I came over … because I’ve been listening a little bit to the conversation and wanted to offer myself as a resource,” she said.Woolard said although the bill had been controversial when it was first passed, she now sees it as attribute of the Atlanta community which not only protects citizens, but makes businesses feel confident in doing business in the city.“It helped us send a very very strong message about the values of our community,” she said.Denson asked Woolard for more information about the Atlanta commission.“We don’t often have someone from Atlanta here that knows first hand,” Denson said.In his closing remarks, District 6 Commissioner Jerry NeSmith said he supports the creation of a civil rights committee, but that the city needs enforceable anti-discrimination policy before a committee can be created.","John Hammel

7-Oct-16,Greg McGarity comments on change of Georgia-South Carolina game time,"The decision to move Georgia’s game against South Carolina to Sunday and to keep the game in Columbia hinged on the fact that South Carolina will be able to provide the necessary safety personnel and services, according to Georgia athletic director Greg McGarity.Had the game been canceled or postponed to a later weekend, both schools do not share any bye weeks for the remainder of the season.“I think everybody wanted to play the game because there’s just not a way to make it up,” McGarity said.


 


In order to accommodate the abundance of South Carolinians evacuating from coastal areas, McGarity said Georgia director of football operations Josh Lee and his staff were in Columbia on Friday morning to assess a non-public facility that could be used to house the team, which will travel to Columbia on Saturday.McGarity said the facility has “hosted federal judicial officials” but has never housed a team. He said that South Carolina’s staff feels confident that it will meet Georgia’s needs. This decision has not been confirmed, but McGarity said another plan, which also does not involve a hotel, exists.That way, hotel rooms will not be filled by Georgia’s athletes and staff.“We did not want to be in the position of having anything to do with displacing evacuees,” McGarity said.Sanford Stadium “was always an option to utilize” had South Carolina not been able to provide appropriate safety measures, according to McGarity. But he said that he was not aware of discussions regarding other venues apart from the two schools’ stadiums. Earlier in the week rumors circulated that the game might be played in the Georgia Dome.On Thursday, LSU’s game on the road against Florida was postponed due to Hurricane Matthew, but McGarity called the two situations “not similar.”“I think the big difference between Gainesville scenario and Columbia scenario is Gainesville is right in the middle [of the hurricane’s projected impact],” McGarity said.McGarity said that the decision to move Georgia’s game occurred last night around 8:15 p.m. in a conference call that included head coach Kirby Smart and conference officials.


 


As of Friday morning, The Weather Channel forecasts that on Sunday Columbia will be sunny with no chance of rain, whereas on Saturday there is a 100 percent chance of heavy rain and winds of 30 mph.“We’re in agreement with everyone and we’re looking forward to being in Columbia,” McGarity said.",Emily Giambalvo @EmilyGiam,sports,https://www.redandblack.com/sports/greg-mcgarity-comments-on-change-of-georgia-south-carolina-game/article_b66060aa-8c9b-11e6-9be9-bf79ccbbfd2c.html
7-Oct-16,College Republicans and Young Democrats face off at UGA's Great Debate,"More that 300 students gathered in Tate Grand Hall a the University of Georgia Thursday night as the College Republicans squared off against the Young Democrats in this year’s Great Debate.The annual tradition, hosted by the Georgia Political Review and University Union, sets the two student organizations against each other for a friendly debate on current political issues and the positions of their respective parties.“This was our first time doing it in the Grand Hall. In the past we’ve done it at the chapel, but we figured because of the upcoming election there would be a little more interest, and [University] Union was doing this great political series that they asked us to be involved with, so we’re really grateful that we got the opportunity,” said Shuchi Goyal, the editor-in-chief of the GPR, “I think we had a really good turnout.”


 


The debate was moderated by two members of the university’s debate union, and consisted of a series of prepared questions followed by an audience question and answer session.Following the opening remarks of both sides, the moderators asked questions organized into six main categories: the American economy, immigration reform, U.S. foreign policy in Syria, America’s role abroad, healthcare and an assortment of more specific local issues, such as the prevalence of sexual assault on college campuses and the Athens anti-discrimination ordinance.On each issue, both groups largely fell along party lines, with the Republicans arguing for free markets and increased emphasis on security, and the Democrats presenting the need for a more inclusive and welcoming America and green initiatives.Unlike their presidential candidate counterparts, both groups largely refrained from direct attacks on each other, though President Obama’s weakness abroad became a common point for the Republicans, and the Democrats were quick to point out the schism Trump has created within the party.Once the moderators finished with the prepared questions, they opened it up to questions from the audience via Twitter. Questions ranged from police brutality to calling out Republicans for disrespecting non-science majors, which resulted from a comment by one of the debaters.Each topic and the responses that accompanied them generated both cheering and jeering alike from the audience, depending on the issue.“A large part of the negative or positive audience response is that the audience themselves are contributing, so they feel more attached to the questions. I think that contributed a lot” said Brennen Mancil, one of the debaters and chairman of the Georgia Association of College Republicans, “It’s a challenge for all sides. Democrats had their moments and Republicans had theirs.”The debate concluded with brief closing remarks, during which the Young Democrats president Campbell Wilks voiced a indictment of the Republican party.


 


“It is inexcusable to look past the bigotry and prejudice that very clearly still have a place in your party,"" she said. ""I am not saying Democrats are perfect, but it is indicative of the Republican party as a whole that Donald Trump was able to secure the nomination.""The comment drew an angry response from the Republican side of the crowd.“I thought that closing statement was very offensive. I’m not a big guy to get offended, but I think it was very hypocritical of the Democratic party,"" said Evans Elliot, a freshman business management major from Roswell. ""In the middle of the debate they advocated for not offending or generalizing anybody, and then they did exactly that, saying we’re accepting of all views except Republicans, and that’s just wrong.""","Harrison Young

7-Oct-16,Georgia volleyball searches for ways to clinch an SEC win,"Georgia volleyball has been searching for solutions to deliver a conference win. After losing four straight conference matches, Georgia sits dead last in the Southeastern Conference.This past weekend the Bulldogs faced Alabama and Auburn losing both matches in four sets. During the Auburn match, the team lost two matches in extra points.“We are so close,” head coach Lizzy Stemke said. “We need to put more consistency with the level of volleyball as it’s raised in the conference.”


 


The team was 12-1 heading into SEC play two weeks ago. Its only loss was against No. 32 Georgia Tech where Georgia lost every match within two to three points.As the season continues, the Bulldogs' competition doesn’t seem to stop. On Friday night, Georgia will face South Carolina at home instead of on the road due to Hurricane Matthew. South Carolina is currently 13-2, but both teams share a loss against Kentucky.Stemke and Amanda Dachs said they don’t believe the struggles come from the physical part of the game. It's the mental components. The team needs to be sharp on the court when it gets down to the 20th points. They have been working on communication and not letting balls fall between one another.“We’ve tried not to be complacence,” Dachs said. “We’ve practiced pushing ourselves beyond our comfort level.”Dachs said sometimes Georgia plays teams that have athletes such as Krystal Rivers who was second in the SEC in kills last year. Players like Rivers bang the ball every second they get. As a leader on the team, Dachs tries to be a fresh breath of air in those sticky situations.“When everyone is frazzled, show the team we are OK from any deficit,” Dachs said. “We are on the cusp of breaking points.”Breaking points isn’t a completely foreign concept to the Bulldogs. Earlier in the season, they traveled to Boston College. After losing 15-25 and 19-25, they reclaimed the match and won the next three sets to secure a win.Unlike Stemke and Dachs, Maddie Lobenstein said the physical aspect plays a role in their hump. During the Alabama match, she said as they went along into extra sets, they were getting fatigued and exhausted. Their level of being aggressive wasn’t staying at the same level.


 


“During overtime, we need to cut the string,"" Lobenstein said. ""Get this point and not wait for them to make a mistake. We need to create our own points.”Georgia has seen rays of light here and there, but the team is still working on getting the sun to come out.“I think everyone has the capability to raise their level at the given time,” Stemke said. “We just need everyone to show up at the given time.”",Mary Ramsaier @Itsmaroula,sports,https://www.redandblack.com/sports/georgia-volleyball-searches-for-ways-to-clinch-an-sec-win/article_a5233202-8cc5-11e6-8ac0-8b5c5f73e436.html
7-Oct-16,Kendall Kazor seamless in position transition,"When an upperclassman is forced to move positions and completely change her role for her team due to a true freshman joining the roster, one might think there would be a cause for friction.That’s not the case with junior Kendall Kazor.During the 2015-16 season, Kazor was playing predominantly in the setter position, racking up 673 assists for Georgia in 92 sets played. A number that not only led all Bulldogs, but was more than all her other teammates combined. She was also able to add 60 kills, ranking seventh overall on the team, 149 digs, third overall on the team, as well as 54 total blocks, putting her at fourth overall on the team. 


 


“We recruited Kendall for her versatility,” head coach Lizzy Stemke said. “We knew that she would be a player that we would have flexibility with based on the needs of our team each and every year.”Enter Meghan Donovan, a freshman phenom from Villa Duchesne High School in St. Louis, Mo. Donovan has a laundry list of accolades from her high school career, including Gatorade Volleyball Player of the Year for the state of Missouri and graduating the all-time leader in career assists for Missouri high schoolers.Kazor is not all too unfamiliar with high school successes as well. She came to Georgia as the 53rd ranked player in the Prepvolleyball.com Senior Aces, won an AAU National Championship in 2011, finished second at the Junior Olympics in 2011 and was a captain three of her four years Ursuline Academy.High school is in the past though, and with a clean slate heading into the 2016-17 season Donovan and Kazor both showcased their skill sets to the coaches before they finally decided on Meghan Donovan for the setter position and moving Kazor to be a hitter.“Last year she [Kazor] set and hit,” Stemke said. “This year we feel like we have a setter in Meghan Donovan to be able to run the full court and Kendall to produce points offensively.”They seem to have made the right choice. Through 17 games, Kazor is averaging 2.41 kills per set, putting her at second among all Bulldogs. Donovan has been producing as well, averaging 9.88 assists per set; to put that in perspective Kazor averaged 7.32 assists per set last year. Donovan leads the team and ranks seventh overall in the SEC in assists per set. A stat that if continued for the rest of the season would be the best assists per set production since Kathleen Gates put up 10.50 assists per set in 2011.In a sport that requires the utmost teamwork and chemistry, Kazor has had no ill feelings towards coaches and Donovan and has become a mentor and guide for the freshman in her first collegiate season.“It’s what the team needed me to do, so I was happy to do it,” Kazor said. “It’s been really exciting and MD has come in seamlessly in the setting position, so that’s nice to pass that onto her and take on an attacking role for the team.”


 


Setter one year, hitter the next. Who knows what will be in store for Kendall Kazor for her senior season.","Conner Burks

9-Oct-16,Kirby Smart criticizes Terry Godwin's decision to score on onside kick,"COLUMBIA, S.C. — Terry Godwin has not had a season for the books thus far. The sophomore from Hogansville, Georgia, had compiled 13 catches for 179 yards and no receiving touchdowns through the first six games.But Godwin was able to find an unusual way into the end zone for the first time this season on an atypical Sunday afternoon college football game.After South Carolina was able to cut the Georgia lead to seven points, the Gamecocks attempted an onside kick with only 1:40 remaining in the game.


 


The kick was a perfect one from South Carolina kicker Elliott Fry, according to Godwin. But the wide receiver was able to take advantage of it anyway as he returned the kickoff for 43 yards to put Georgia up by 14 with just 1:33 left on the game clock.“Actually in the huddle we were like, ‘Just get the ball. Make sure you hold onto the ball and cover it,'” Godwin said. “When I fielded it, I looked up and my line had it blocked perfect. It was nothing but green grass and I was like, ‘Just go score.'”While he and his teammates celebrated the play that gave Georgia plenty of breathing room with little time left, his head coach had his own thoughts on whether Godwin should have taken the ball to the house or simply recover it.Kirby Smart felt the wide receiver didn’t make the right decision on the play.“I don’t think so,” Smart said. “It worked, so what does everybody base it off? Results. But I would suggest to get down which is what I encouraged him to do.”Smart suggested that Godwin could learn a “valuable lesson” from what happened on his return. He even went back and talked about a play from the Tennessee against Texas A&M game from Saturday night where Malik Foreman forced a fumble for Tennessee right before the Aggies’ Trayveon Williams was able to score. The play kept Tennessee's hopes alive at the time and Smart feared the same could have happened in this game if someone came up from behind Godwin to knock the ball loose.The play on special teams, as Smart said in his own words, wound up working at the end of the day. Had Godwin missed or lost the ball on his way to the end zone, it could have changed the outcome of the game and given South Carolina a chance at one last drive.But Godwin was able to savor his first touchdown of the year on Sunday afternoon regardless.


 


“It was very exciting to get my first touchdown like that this year,” Godwin said. “To actually seal the game, it was very big for us.”",John Durham @johndurham00,sports,https://www.redandblack.com/sports/kirby-smart-criticizes-terry-godwin-s-decision-to-score-on/article_7394b4a0-8e81-11e6-aab5-ffc5c7fed928.html
10-Oct-16,Former UGA football player tweets about Trump's 'locker room talk' defense,"On Oct. 9, Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton took part in the second presidential debate, the two facing new scandals that arose over the past two weeks.One of these topics, concerning Republican candidate Donald Trump and his defense Sunday night of lewd comments he made about women in 2005, evoked a viral response from former University of Georgia wide receiver Chris Conley.When probed at the debate for his reasoning behind his comments about kissing and groping women and making sexual advances towards married women, Trump said it was “locker room talk.""


 


Conley tweeted about Trump's statement, saying that, as an athlete who spends a lot of time in a locker room, the candidate's comments were not reflective of ""locker room talk.""Just for reference. I work in a locker room (every day)... that is not locker room talk. Just so you know...— Chris Conley (@_flight17_) October 10, 2016Have I been in every locker room? No. But the guys I know and respect don't talk like that. They talk about girls but not like that.

After a large response, Conley posted a tweet standing by his prior position.I'm done. If that's the talk you hear around you then be the place where change begins.

10-Oct-16,Georgia defense brings heat in win over South Carolina,"The sacks finally came today.Kirby Smart wants his team to know that pressuring the quarterback is not the ultimate goal for his pass rush, but he can’t deny that he feels good when his team gets a lot of sacks. “I am happy for those guys because they have been working hard,” Smart said. “We still have a long way to go if we want to affect the quarterback.”


 


Georgia’s pass rush can take pride that not only were they able to force South Carolina quarterback Perry Orth into tough situations, but they were also able to bring down Orth five times. Coming into the South Carolina game, Georgia had only six sacks on the year, which wasn’t of concern to Smart, who said he measures his pass rush by how they affect the quarterback. But today, Georgia brought down Orth six times. “We feed off each other. [Lorenzo Carter] saw I was getting one, then he said he had to get one, then Chuks [Amaechi] said he had to get one and when you get one, sacks come in bunches,” linebacker Davin Bellamy said. Orth finished the day 26-for-36 with 288 yards. The fact that Orth was more of a pocket-passer gave Georgia a better chance to keep Orth contained and track him down in the backfield.“We faced a guy who was going to stand tall in the pocket and we were going to pin our ears back and go get him,” Bellamy said. Standing in the pocket made things easier for the Georgia secondary, too. “When the quarterback just sits back there it makes it easier for him to read,” said Malkom Parrish, who had an interception. Smart did warn that he wants Georgia to become a better pass rushing team with just four guys because he believes Georgia’s defense will face better offensive lines during the rest of the season.


 


It wasn’t just the pass rush that limited the South Carolina offense though; Georgia’s rush defense stopped South Carolina dead in its tracks.Through three quarters, Georgia held the Gamecock running backs to just 20 yards on nine carries.Much like the Bulldog offensive line did on the other side of the ball, Georgia’s defensive line commanded the line of scrimmage and didn’t allow the Gamecocks to move the ball on the ground.“The SEC is going to be stop the run first and then try to force them to pass,” Bellamy said. “Every week our game plan is going to be stopping the run.” South Carolina ran the ball 13 times on first down, however the Bulldog defense limited the Gamecocks to around 2.5 yards per carry on first down. This put the Gamecocks in passing situations during the other three downs. Georgia’s stingy first down defense forced South Carolina to throw the ball 26 times on second and third down versus running it six times. “Every week, it’s stopping the run on first down,” Natrez Patrick said. “That’s the plan.”The Gamecocks finished with just 30 yards on 26 carries. Georgia also forced the Gamecocks into two fumbles.","Alexander T. Makrides

10-Oct-16,SEC Power Rankings: Georgia stuck in the middle,"With six weeks of college football now come and gone, The Red & Black's sports staff updated its weekly rankings of teams in the Southeastern Conference. Tweet @redblacksports with your thoughts.Tier One – The class of the conferenceAlabama, Texas A&M


 


Week in and week out, these two squads continue to prove themselves to be the best teams in the SEC. On Saturday, the Crimson Tide faced a tricky road test against Arkansas. But in typical dominant fashion, Alabama jumped out to a 35-10 lead and went on to win 49-30. In their toughest test of the season, the Aggies defeated ninth-ranked Tennessee in double overtime, 45-38. The rest of the conference may be muddled, but right now there is no questioning that Alabama and Texas A&M are the class of the conference. — Jed MayTier Two - Good but not greatOle Miss, TennesseeOnce the favorites to knock off SEC powerhouses, Ole Miss and Tennessee now sit with at least one loss this season. It seems that in this conference the question of which teams have the best shot to beat Alabama often arises. Ole Miss had its chance earlier in the season but lost after giving up a 21-point lead. Tennessee will try this weekend, but comes into the matchup as the underdog following a double-overtime loss against Texas A&M. Even if both these teams finish without wins against the Crimson Tide, they’ll have respectable records and plenty of accolades. They just can’t be on that top tier. — Emily GiambalvoTier Three - Second fiddleGeorgia, Auburn, ArkansasAt this point in the season, each of these 4-2 teams have shown they can handle lesser opponents but struggle once the big games roll around. Georgia has been blown out by Ole Miss and lost a close one to Tennessee. Auburn has fallen to title contenders like Clemson and Texas A&M. Arkansas has also lost to the Aggies and No. 1 Alabama. These three teams will continue to play second fiddle until they can capture a win against an elite opponent. — John DurhamTier Four - It could be worse


 


Missouri, South Carolina, KentuckyWhen 2015 ended, South Carolina finished dead last in the SEC East with Missouri and Kentucky sitting directly above the Gamecocks. Not much has changed for these teams this year. The three SEC East teams all sit above the cellar dweller Vanderbilt so far. The only thing that Missouri, South Carolina and Kentucky have going for them at this point in the season is that they aren't at the very bottom of the conference. — John DurhamTier Five - The Homecoming opponentsVanderbilt, Mississippi StateVanderbilt and Mississippi State are traditionally at the bottom of the SEC, and this year that is no different. After a few years of success with Dak Prescott at quarterback, the Bulldogs are sputtering around toward the bottom of the SEC West. Its worst loss of the year came this past weekend — a 38-14 demolition at the hands of Auburn. Vanderbilt, despite being expected to finish in the middle of the SEC East, is at the bottom of it with three conference loses already. The defense has been good for the Commodores, but the offense is abysmal. There’s a reason Vanderbilt is Georgia’s homecoming game and Mississippi State is BYU’s. — Wilson AlexanderUndefined Tier - Question markFlorida, LSUFor the sake of this week, we don't know how good these teams are. They didn't play. After Hurricane Matthew threatened the East cost, this game wasn't moved from Gainesville, Florida, causing plenty of controversy as to when, where and if this game that could be crucial to the SEC title race will be rescheduled. — Emily Giambalvo

11-Oct-16,"Athens AIDS hosts walk to raise money, awareness of disease in community","In an effort to raise awareness to HIV and AIDS and raise money to fund research, AIDS Athens hosted a walk through the University of Georgia campus and around downtown Athens.The organization is focused on combating rising rural infection rates that are largely down to a lack of knowledge about how the disease functions, as well as providing support suffering from the disease.At the event Saturday, close to 300 people registered and walked the three mile course around town.


 


Cassandra Bray, the interim executive director at AIDS Athens, said events like the walk educate the community, which will hopefully prevent further spread of the disease.“We should support AIDS awareness because it’s a communicable disease, it’s a concern of the community and is something that is very treatable,” she said. “If we can get people into medical care, and if we can get them the treatment and meds they need, they are 96 percent less likely to pass the virus on to other people.”Bray is optimistic about the research aspect of donations and combating HIV/AIDS.“There’s a lot of research, and I do feel within the next 10 or 15 years, if there is not a full cure for the virus, there may be some functional cure for it,” she said. “I think the fact that we maybe can see the end of this really supports the need to continue research on this.”The hope has led to renewed vigor on the part of AIDS prevention groups. Originally the walks took place in the 1980s and 1990s when AIDS awareness was just coming to the forefront of public mind. Focus on the issue on campus then dissolved over time until 2007.“There was a group of young people from UGA that met with our then-executive director and said they wanted to put on a walk,” Bray said. “The first four walks were all student initiatives with proceeds going to AIDS Athens.”AIDS Athens now puts on the trek through town, she said, even when student interest in the matter seemed to disappear.“Over some time the student interested waned, but because we felt like it was beneficial, we wanted to continue the work,” Bray said.


 


Melissa South, a sophomore cellular biology major, pointed to subtle boundaries between students and the surrounding Athens community.“I feel like being a student at UGA, there is kind of a disconnect between ACC and the UGA campus,” she said. “I think it’s good to be aware of what’s going on, and I know Athens has a lot of issues, such as education, so being aware of that is important.”As for student turnout for the AIDS Athens walk, South said it is a work in progress to get more students interested.“There’s more work to be done,” she said. “I saw a few younger people here today, but I didn’t notice a whole lot of UGA students over here. I think there is definitely a lot of work to be done.”The funds raised by the Athens AIDS walk will be directed towards AIDS Athens' mission of engaging the community in a dialogue over how to handle the disease.","Julien Gelly

11-Oct-16,Defense has short week to prepare for Vanderbilt offense,"Kirby Smart and his coaching staff spent the the three-hour bus ride returning from Columbia, South Carolina after Georgia’s 28-14 win preparing for the next game.They might not normally do that, but because the Bulldogs had to play their game on Sunday afternoon instead of Saturday night, Smart and the rest of the coaches immediately began preparing for a Vanderbilt team with an offensive approach different from any Georgia has played this season.Normally, Georgia’s players would have the day after a game off. However, because the Bulldogs’ game was moved back a day, the players were not given Monday off. Instead, they had a lighter practice on Monday that included light running and walk-through periods. Other than that, Georgia’s schedule has been the same.


 


“The more routine for them, the better,” Smart said. “I think the coaches can handle it because we’ve all had short weeks before, and we’ll have to game plan a little bit quicker.”This week, Georgia is playing a Vanderbilt offense that operates in a pro-style offense, much like its own. For a defense that has played spread teams every week this season, the familiarity is a welcome sight.“I'm excited to be in the box a little bit more this week,” inside linebacker Natrez Patrick said. “They like to run downhill powers similar to our offense. It's going to be something we've seen in practice a lot.”Since the beginning of preseason practices in August, Georgia’s defense has faced its offense on a daily basis. Georgia often goes “good-on-good” in practices, meaning the first team defense and offense practices against each other. So, Patrick and the rest of the of the defense practices against Nick Chubb and Sony Michel every day.Outside linebacker Chuks Amaechi said that will help them prepare during a short week. On the legs of Ralph Webb, the Commodores average 147.2 rushing yards per game, which is 13th in the SEC.Although the Commodores aren’t statistically imposing and Georgia runs a pro-style offense itself, Smart seems concerned that the defense will have to prepare for a completely different style than what it has faced.“The biggest problem for us right now is we’ve got a short week and we’re almost having to play a completely different offense,” Smart said. “You can’t say ‘Oh, I can rely on last week.’ No, you can’t rely on last week. You’ve got to go put a completely new package together, and it’s completely foreign to our guys.”","Wilson Alexander

11-Oct-16,Jacob Eason still correcting freshman mistakes,"Jacob Eason is a freshman. As such he is bound to make freshman mistakes and have freshman moments.Sunday against South Carolina, Eason looked like a freshman. The 6-foot-5, 235-pound quarterback was 5-for-17 for 29 yards, a touchdown and an interception against the Gamecocks.“It was more a matter of him not being comfortable with the protection, so he got a little rattled at times and started looking around,” Kirby Smart said.


 


Georgia is halfway through its 2016 season, and it looks to be sticking with Eason the rest of the way. The freshman has thrown for 1020 yards, eight touchdowns, five interceptions and his completion percentage is 51.2 percent.“Jacob knows that he’s had his ups and downs this season. He’s had his ‘wow’ moments and he’s had his bad moments,” Smart said. “I think when you are starting a true freshman you know that you’re going to inherently go through some of those.”Some of those downs came against Missouri when he didn’t look off a safety and threw an interception. He has also thrown two interceptions in the red zone this season. Then, against Tennessee, he double clutched the football in his own end zone and allowed a strip-sack touchdown for the Volunteers.“He’s got to do better with his play-action fakes,” Smart said. “He’s got to be more detailed with his drops. He’s got to be more exact in reading coverage. He’s got to be able to communicate a little better.”Eason’s had some highlight-reel throws as well this season. Against North Carolina, he threw a 51-yard bomb to Isaiah McKenzie, which set up the winning score, and two weeks ago, he launched a 47-yard touchdown pass, which looked to be the game-winner against Tennessee. Smart said Eason needs to trust and rely on some of Georgia’s players around him. The offensive line has three experienced veterans on it, and the backfield is made up of the dynamic tandem of Sony Michel and Nick Chubb.The first-year head coach said he believes that when Eason relies on the offense’s experience, he can become more comfortable at the quarterback position.“You’ve got to encourage, you’ve got to teach, you’ve got to improve him as a player so that there’s progress there,” Smart said.


 


One of the biggest assets Smart said Eason has going for him is his composure. During the game against South Carolina, Sony Michel said he didn’t notice Eason getting frustrated.“He kept it together,” Michel said. “He just wanted to go back out and have another shot at it.”Even Eason’s teammates on the other side of the ball notice he is improving.“We don’t make it easy on him,” linebacker Natrez Patrick said. “We want him to work hard and he is doing that and you can see him getting better every day.”","Alexander T.

11-Oct-16,Jonathan Ledbetter set to return from suspension,"Sophomore defensive end Jonathan Ledbetter will be on the field for Georgia for the first time this season against Vanderbilt. However, how much he will play remains to be seen.During Kirby Smart’s press conference Tuesday afternoon, the first-year head coach announced that Ledbetter would be in Georgia’s lineup Oct. 15. “He has handled everything we have asked him to do,” Smart said. “ He is working hard and the best thing he has done is make our offense better.”


 


The 6-foot-4, 269-pound sophomore was suspended for the first six games of the season due to two alcohol-related arrests as dictated by University of Georgia policy.Ledbetter was arrested for underage drinking and possession of false I.D. earlier this year, but the district attorney decided not to prosecute the case. Then, in July, Ledbetter was arrested for a DUI when he was found asleep at the wheel of a stationary vehicle.  Smart said Ledbetter has been hard at work on the scout team despite not being able to suit up on Saturdays. According to inside linebacker Natrez Patrick, Ledbetter has received scout team player of the week every week this season.“He wasn’t sitting out,"" Smart said. ""He was taking a lot of reps. He was disruptive to them in order to give us all these looks of the hard players we will have to block” Patrick, who rooms with Ledbetter, said that Ledbetter's ability to set the edge of the line will benefit the defense. He also said the sophomore is looking forward to returning to the field.Smart added that Ledbetter will help the defense in terms of their pass rush.“The 250-290 [pound] range, we have no one in that range, we have really big or we have outside linebacker range. Jonathon falls in that mold,” Smart said. “He is a guy that can play 3-technique if he needs to and play outside if he needs to. He gives us some more flexibility there.”","Alexander T. Makrides

12-Oct-16,"In its 87th season, Sanford Stadium still provides home-field advantage","Louis Armstrong’s hit song “When You’re Smiling” will not be heard at many tailgates before Georgia’s homecoming game against Vanderbilt on Saturday. Fans will not be going to theaters to see No. 1 movie “Welcome Danger” once the game ends, nor will they be rushing home to listen to game four of the World Series between the Chicago Cubs and the Philadelphia Athletics on the radio. The fans described above are not from 2016. They are not even from the 21st century. Those fans are from October 1929. 


 


And yet, both these fans and current Bulldog supporters share one thing in common.They both attend Georgia football games in Sanford Stadium.Wednesday marks the 87th anniversary of Georgia’s first game at Sanford Stadium. On that day, the Bulldogs defeated Yale 15-0.Since that time, Georgia has had one of the best home-field advantages in all of college football. Through the 2015 season, the Bulldogs have compiled a 337-103-9 record at home, a winning percentage of .750. “It’s just an electric atmosphere,” junior linebacker Lorenzo Carter said. Georgia has had numerous double-digit home winning streaks over the years, including a 15-game streak from 2011-13. Senior offensive lineman Brandon Kublanow was around for the final game of that streak, a game that he remembers vividly. “My freshman year we played LSU,” Kublanow said. “That was crazy. Every time it gets loud, but I do remember that LSU game. That was nuts.” Other players have different recollections of the loudest moment they’ve witnessed in Sanford. Carter said the first time Todd Gurley touched the ball in his return against Auburn in 2014 was “the loudest I’ve ever heard.” 


 


Junior defensive back Aaron Davis said the season opener against Clemson in 2014 was the most raucous home environment he played in. The crowd that afternoon even had an effect on the home team.“I remember against Clemson, I was trying to say something to [safety] Quincy [Mauger] and he couldn’t hear me,” Davis said. Playing in Sanford Stadium means a little more to Davis. He grew up in Locust Grove as an avid Georgia fan. Davis called the opportunity to play in Sanford Stadium “an honor and a privilege.” So as Sanford Stadium prepares to host its 452nd Georgia football game, it will usher a new breed of Bulldogs through its gates. These fans listen to the Chainsmokers instead of Louis Armstrong, and they watch movies starring Tom Cruise as opposed to Harold Lloyd. But just like their fandom ancestors from 87 years ago, the fans that will invade Athens this weekend will be watching a football game on a Saturday afternoon in Sanford Stadium.",Jed May @jedmay315,sports,https://www.redandblack.com/sports/in-its-th-season-sanford-stadium-still-provides-home-field/article_c79584c6-90e3-11e6-bfd8-ffabff3b5cea.html
13-Oct-16,Weathering the storm: Students feel the effects of Hurricane Matthew,"Hundreds of thousands of Georgians fled affected areas in the state after Gov. Nathan Deal ordered mandatory evacuations in preparation for Hurricane Matthew.As the storm’s damage spread, several University of Georgia students from the southeastern region anticipated news and updates from their families.The Category 2 storm killed four people in Georgia and displaced hundreds more. Nearly 1,200 University of Georgia students are from the 13 counties — Brantley, Bryan, Bulloch, Camden, Charlton, Chatham, Effingham, Evans, Glynn, Liberty, Long, McIntosh and Wayne — in which Gov.

Brooke DeLoach, a sophomore human development and family science major from Fleming, said she waited to hear from her family who chose not to evacuate. “My family decided to stay. My family believed that it would be more of a hassle to leave than [it would be] to ride it out and stay,” she said. “It was stressful not being there with them, but at the same time, I knew that I wouldn't have been able to do anything about it.”

DeLoach said storms like these can be predictable because in coastal counties, tropical storms happen often.“Storms are predictable to an extent, but that doesn't mean you can control the outcomes,” she said. “I think the storm was highly underestimated. My family was very nonchalant about it coming. I don't think they realized how damaging and scary it would be.”DeLoach said she believes the local media did not stress enough how important it was to evacuate.“I think that the news downplayed it in such a way that Georgians were not as concerned or prepared that they should have been,"" she said.DeLoach was able to keep in constant contact with her family through text, since there was not enough cell service in her family’s area to hold a phone call. But due to power outages, phone battery life was a precious commodity.


 


Sisters Mia and Tatyanna Campbell, a sophomore and freshman respectively, said they began to worry about their family in Hinesville after losing contact with their mom.“We lost contact for a little bit. With the power not being on, [our mom] couldn’t charge her phone,” Mia said. “And then we didn’t hear anything until late that next day after the storm.”Tatyanna was confident her mom knew what she was doing.“I knew that if she was not going to evacuate, that she would be okay,” she said. “The only person I was really worried about was Romon, our step dad, who was on the road before the storm.”The sisters heard reports of a man who died after a tree landed on his car while driving on a road in their area as the storm was rolling in.

""Luckily his work closed, and he made it home okay,” Mia Campbell said.While 75 percent of Chatham County — which includes the city of Savannah — evacuated, junior Henry Bochner said his parents believed they could handle Hurricane Matthew, as they did during preceding storms such as Hurricane Hermine, which hit the Georgia coast earlier this year.

“We were lucky in my opinion. My parents didn't seem to be worried at all, which scared me a little,” Bochner said. “I guess my family just wanted to test the hurricane and see if the house would hold down, in all honesty. They didn't see a need in spending a lot of gas money to travel somewhere else.”But some students and their families were not so lucky.Cassidy Thacker, a freshman at Georgia Southern University located in Bulloch County experienced the storm in a way she never expected.“They prepared us so much for Hurricane Hermine and all we got was a little rain. But when they shut down campus on Thursday at 10 a.m., people started to get worried,” she said. “Everyone left.”Thacker was one of the few who stayed behind because her family is located even further south in McIntosh County. Her mom evacuated and stayed with Thacker in a residence hall at Georgia Southern.Thacker said her dorm on the first floor of her residence hall flooded during the storm.“We had over an inch of standing water in our room. Pretty much the whole hallway flooded,” she said. “Now everyone has been relocated. And the university has never had this happen before so they had no plan.”Thacker is temporarily staying in a different dorm, but was unable to take all of her belongings with her from her old dorm.

“They just sent out an email to tell us that if we need to get back in our rooms for any reason we have to be escorted by a member of the housing staff. So we can't just go in and out as we realize stuff we need,” she said. “And they haven't given us any kind of estimate for when we will be back in our rooms.”Georgia Southern’s campus reopened Tuesday, but Thacker said most professors cancelled their classes to allow students more time to recover from the damages of the storm.

Colleges in the Savannah area have yet to return to normal class schedules. Josiah Byler, a sophomore at Armstrong State University said classes were cancelled on Oct. 5, and will not resume until Oct. 17.“Above anything, returning to school will be a challenge because classes were canceled during midterms,” he said. “At this point, no comments have been made as to whether or not the semester will be extended due to the evacuation and damage to the university’s campuses.”Byler and his family evacuated to Epworth where they stayed with extended family. However, when they returned home to Flemington, just outside of Savannah, they saw devastation.“Hurricane Matthew caused a very stressful and emotional time for my family. In August 2015, large sections of our house were destroyed due to a flood. We weren’t able to go home until late November of the same year and are still recovering from the flood by going through the remains of the destruction and the battle with the insurance company,” he said. “The thought of having everything destroyed again after over a year of recovering from the flood was very difficult for my family.”At some point during the storm, what is believed to be a tornado ripped through parts of the area, adding to the destruction for some.

“The tornado could have proceeded to hit our house directly, but fortunately the tornado curved around our house at a right angle and back through the woods behind it,” he said. “We have about $50,000 worth of damage to the property, but the only things of sentimental value destroyed were the Christmas decorations.”Alex Wiggins, a senior at the Savannah College of Art and Design, said he is unsure if Savannah will ever feel the same way as it did before the storm, or if locals will have to adopt a new normal.Wiggins said SCAD is in the process of recovering from the storm, and has sent out little information on the storm’s effects to the downtown Savannah campus.“Classes are cancelled and we are under a curfew for like a week or so,” he said. “And we now have to like come back during the middle of Thanksgiving break to make up a week.”Interstate 95 headed southbound was closed off to any individuals trying to reenter the Savannah area until early this week.For those who evacuated, Wiggins posted on his Facebook page that he would go and check on anyone’s house in the downtown Savannah area.“Feel free to send me names and addresses and I will try and make a list of places to check out so that you have a peace of mind or to learn updates,” he said in a post.Wiggins received almost 20 requests from those unable to return home and almost 100 likes on his post.

“The damage really was just so shocking,” said Shelby Alexander, a senior at the College of Coastal Georgia in Brunswick. “I don’t think anyone was expecting it to be this bad.”Alexander lives on St. Simons, an island on Georgia’s Golden Isles in Glynn County.""This was pretty eye-opening to people down here,” she said. “But the greatest thing to see come from this looking back is the community really coming together to help people in need.”","Charlotte Norsworthy

The report indicated that the victim has no memory of the details of the event, and the case has been marked inactive due to the victim refusing contact with police. Athens man found yelling at street lightOn Oct. 9, Athens-Clarke County police responded to a call about a man standing in the middle of a road and yelling at a street light.According to a police report, responding officers arrived at the scene near the Athens-Clarke County Tag Office. They had difficulty getting the man to pay attention to them. Instead, the man reportedly seemed fixed on the street light.While he stared at the light, the man reportedly yelled “Yes God! Yes God! I trust you God!”Police were able to get the man out of the road, where they questioned and searched him, according to the report, though he continued to yell as they talked to him.When police asked the man if he had taken any drugs, he reportedly responded “yes, LSD.”After agreeing to go to the hospital, the man began to resist and ran out of the ambulance and down Jail Road. Police later found him lying on the ground behind the Athens-Clarke County evidence building, where he was detained.

13-Oct-16,Behind Enemy Bylines: Previewing Georgia vs. Vanderbilt,"Behind Enemy Bylines is a series in which The Red & Black discusses Georgia’s upcoming game with the sports editor of the student newspaper of Georgia’s opponent for that week. This week, assistant sports editor Wilson Alexander talked to Robbie Weinstein of The Vanderbilt Hustler at Vanderbilt.Wilson Alexander: Coming into this season it seemed Vanderbilt could be a team that would surprise some people, but it's 2-4. Why?Robbie Weinstein: The offense really has not taken the step forward that people expected. It's had a couple decent moments, but only against Conference USA opponents. Against Power Five conference opponents they haven't been able to have enough explosive plays. When you have to drive down the field and you aren't able to put any chunk plays together I think it's really hard for them to be able to put together multiple positive plays in a row. Their receiver have been underwhelming this year. Although Ralph Webb is very good, he can't do it all by himself. I think the offense hasn't taken much of a step forward. The defense, while still decent, hasn't been as good as expected, honestly. I think people thought the defense was going to improve even a little bit more after last year, and they've probably taken a slight step back.


 


WA: I'm surprised you say 'taken a step back' because this seems like a pretty good defense. So why do you say that?RW: They're good against traditional offenses and quarterbacks that are not mobile. Maybe that bodes well for them against UGA from what little I've seen of them. Against these dink-and-dunk, fast-paced offenses like Middle Tennessee and Western Kentucky they've given up a lot of yards. They got completely roasted against Georgia Tech. Having said that, they were good against South Carolina. They were definitely good against Florida. But they've struggled against alternative-style offenses.WA: On that defensive side, what does linebacker Zach Cunningham do for that defense?RW: He's very athletic and definitely very mobile for an inside linebacker. He's not necessarily the strongest linebacker in the world. He's got more than enough strength to tackle these big, athletic running backs but his strength as a player is probably his range. He's all over the field.WA: On the offensive side, it seemed like naming Kyle Shurmur the starter at quarterback early was going to help, but as you mentioned it hasn't really. Why is that?RW: I think in some ways it hasn't hurt them necessarily because in the first game when they pulled Shurmur and put in Freeback, Shurmur did not play well after coming back into the game following the switch. It's possible that naming a starter early — maybe Shurmur could have been worse if they haven't decided early. I think he doesn't have the arm talent that you would expect from a four-star recruit. As a result, he's decently accurate but it might take him a little bit longer to grow into this system or just become an above-average college quarterback. It doesn't help that the offensive line is just OK and the receiving core has been pretty week this year.WA: What has to happen for Vanderbilt to win this game?RW: First of all, they need to score a defensive touchdown or a special teams touchdown. Looking back, since Derek Mason has been here they don't put points on the board against SEC teams. I can't think of a time when they had more than one offensive touchdown in any of those games, honestly. They definitely need contributions from the defense and special teams.


 


WA: Who do you have winning this game?RW: I think UGA for sure. I'll go something like 24-10 in a game that doesn't seem as close as the score indicates. Vandy's defense does matchup pretty well with UGA's offense, but Ralph Webb may not even play this week. If he doesn't then they won't get to 10 [points] I wouldn't think. I don't see them scoring more than 17 points in this game. It's going to be very difficult for them to win. I fully expect UGA to get a comfortable W in this one.","Wilson Alexander, Robbie Weinstein

14-Oct-16,Captain Morgan Ainslie excited to return to Georgia women’s cross country,"Injuries are something every team dreads. Players train all offseason to combat them and recover quickly to get back on the field when they fall victim to them. Anytime someone goes down, it always sets the team back, often in more ways than one.This sentiment is especially true when that person is the captain of the team. This season, the captain of the Georgia women’s cross country team, junior Morgan Ainslie, was forced to miss two meets due to an undisclosed illness. While the Bulldogs had strong outings at the Commodore Classic and the Paul Short Run, her absence was felt.


 


In the team’s opening race at the UGA Cross Country Invitational, Ainslie came in second place. She finished just four seconds behind her teammate, freshman Jessica Drop. In that race, four out of the top five finishers were Bulldogs, including freshmen Sam Drop and Yanely Gomez, as Georgia went on to win. In the next two meets, the team placed 10th and 13th. While it struggled on the course without its captain, Georgia also faced challenges during preparation for meets. “She was the person we had designated as the team leader, and that person takes on a lot of little roles in making sure things get done,” head coach Patrick Cunniff said.One of those roles was taking a young talent in Jessica Drop under her wing as her training partner. When Ainslie became sick, the freshman lost her mentor for the time being. “It was kind of hard,” Drop said. “She was my training partner at the time, so I didn’t really know how to respond to that.”Clearly, however, Drop figured it out. She has been the team’s top finisher in each meet thus far in her first season. Along with Jessica, her twin sister, Sam, has also scored for Georgia in every meet. Sticking with the trend of freshman scorers, Gomez has scored twice as well.When one of the team’s most consistent scorers went down, there were three newcomers to help keep the team afloat.


 


“Other people had to step up,” Cunniff said. “The girls just knew that everybody had to get better and fill that void when we race. In a lot of good ways, it challenged us.”For freshmen to have this much success at such an early point in their career isn’t common, although it certainly has made a positive impact for Cunniff and Georgia. Comparing to Ainslie’s freshman year, she scored once in the Furman Classic after taking 16th.In 2014, Ainslie redshirted for the Bulldogs. Last year, she continued to show signs of improvement, scoring twice. One of those scores was in the team’s 6K race at the NCAA South Regionals, where she was the team’s third runner to cross the finish line.Now, as the Lassiter alumna is preparing to race for the first time since Sept. 3, she is able to reflect on her career at Georgia. Ultimately, what led her to becoming a captain in 2016 is her consistency in being committed to the program.It wasn’t always easy. But she didn’t let it affect the way she trained. “When you get here as a freshman, you have to take everything in and trust that the training is going to work out,” Ainslie said. “I think I’m a good testament to that. You just have to trust the program that it’s going to develop you into a better athlete.” While Ainslie is ready to lace up her spikes once again, her teammates are simply glad to have their captain back. She brings an energy to the table that can’t be matched, whether that be at before a race, or even at practice.“It’s been great to have her back,” Jessica Drop said. “She’s definitely the leader on this team. She makes us want to come out her and practice.” 


TNCMS.AdManager.render({region: 'fixed-big-ad-bottom-asset', slot: 1, fold: ""below""});


Certainly there have been some unforeseen circumstances for Ainslie, but she is remaining positive and looking forward to what’s to come for her and her team.Through the adversity, she feels the team is primed to make a postseason run.“I think this team is going to do much better at SECs and regionals than before,” Ainslie said.",Zach Shugan @ZachShugan,sports,https://www.redandblack.com/sports/captain-morgan-ainslie-excited-to-return-to-georgia-women-s/article_21e33e10-9255-11e6-a9fb-77fa9b4dac73.html
14-Oct-16,5 players to watch during the Georgia and Vanderbilt game Saturday,"With Georgia playing Vanderbilt in Athens, Georgia, this weekend, Red & Black assistant sports editor John Durham pointed out five players to keep an eye on this Saturday afternoon.Zach Cunningham: Cunningham is the anchor of the Commodore defense. So far this year the inside linebacker has stuffed the stat sheet with 62 total tackles, 10.5 of which were tackles for loss. Both of those stats lead the Southeastern Conference. Look for the redshirt junior to track down Sony Michel and Nick Chubb behind the line of scrimmage on Saturday afternoon.Ralph Webb: Although the Vanderbilt rushing attack ranks second to last in the SEC, Webb, the running back, is not to blame. Through the Commodores’ first six games, Webb has rushed to the tune of 113.7 yards per game while also chipping in with 10.7 receiving yards a game. He has even found the end zone five times in six games this season. Webb is no slouch.


 


Oren Burks: On Saturdays Burks is all over the field and the stat sheet, lining up at linebacker and safety for Vanderbilt. His numbers show his versatility. Burks has 24 total tackles and is tied for the team lead with two sacks while also intercepting one pass and breaking up another five. The play maker will be hard to stop wherever he lines up against Georgia’s offense.  Jonathan Ledbetter: Ledbetter will be finished serving his suspension for underage drinking and possessing a fake I.D. after the first six games of the season. It remains to be seen if the sophomore defensive end is given playing time on Saturday afternoon in Athens. He’ll provide the Georgia line with some depth as the season continues.Brian Herrien: Herrien has had himself a nice freshman campaign. He has been relied on just as much as the other Georgia running backs this year and has produced with the playing time he has been given. Herrien has scored three touchdowns while rushing for 6.8 yards per carry, good for the team high. Jim Chaney will dial up No. 35 in this homecoming tilt.","John Durham

14-Oct-16,Scouting Report: Vanderbilt,"Nobody picked Vanderbilt to win the SEC East this season. But the Commodores were thought to be a team that could win eight or nine games and potentially pull an upset or two. Vanderbilt has definitely been competitive this season. Four of its six games have been decided by seven points or less. But so far, the wins haven’t materialized. The Commodores will come into Athens to face Georgia sporting a record of 2-4.Most of the blame for the struggles can be directed toward the offense. Against the four Power Five opponents Vanderbilt has played, it is averaging just nine points per game. Not coincidentally, the Commodores have lost all four of those games.


 


Part of the reason for this has been unsteady play at quarterback. Sophomore starting quarterback Kyle Shurmur has been erratic, completing just 52.8 percent of his passes with three touchdowns and three interceptions. He averages just 5.3 yards per attempt, which is tied for last in the SEC.The Commodores also lack one go-to receiver that Shurmur can use when he needs a big completion. Five receivers have caught between nine and seventeen passes on the year. Freshman Kalija Lipscomb and junior C.J. Duncan have been the most productive targets, as they have combined to haul in 34 passes for 392 yards.With the struggles of the passing game, the offense revolves around junior running back Ralph Webb. A powerful runner who is also very elusive, Webb averages nearly 23 carries per game. He has been very productive with those carries as well, rushing for 682 yards (a 5.01 per carry average) and five touchdowns.Sophomore Khari Blasingame has proved to be a solid backup for Webb, averaging over four yards per carry with three touchdowns on 42 carries.The offensive line lost three starters from last year, and then projected starter Andrew Jelks was lost to injury for the year before the season. The run blocking has been solid, but the line has already surrendered 13 sacks to opponents. Offensive struggles are nothing new for Vanderbilt. But head coach Derek Mason is known more as a defensive mastermind. Once again, the defense is the better side of the ball for the Commodores. The defense is loaded with experience. All 11 starters are either juniors or seniors.The front seven is anchored by junior linebacker Zach Cunningham. He has already racked up 62 tackles and 10.5 tackles for loss on the season. The run defense as a whole, however, has been a little lacking.


 


Vanderbilt is surrendering an average of 176.8 yards per game, which currently places them 79th in the nation. However, these stats are slightly inflated by giving up 289 yards to triple-option team Georgia Tech. Without that matchup, the average rushing yards allowed drops to 154.4 yards per game.The passing defense has performed a little better. With an average of 215.3 passing yards allowed per game, the Commodores rank fourth in the SEC in that category.The defensive unit has been very opportunistic forcing turnovers, with 11 takeaways through six games.The kicking game has been one of the stronger groups on Vanderbilt’s team this season. Junior kicker Tommy Openshaw has converted on seven of nine field goal attempts, while freshman punter Sam Loy has averaged 42.5 yards per punt. The return game, however, has been virtually nonexistent. The Commodores as a team are averaging a measly 2.42 yards per punt return. For the Commodores to have any chance at pulling an upset over Georgia, it will all come down to the offense. The defense has been solid for most of the season. If the offense can support them, then Vanderbilt make this game a bit more interesting than Bulldog fans would like. If not, then it will just be another homecoming rout for the Bulldogs.",Jed May @jedmay315,sports,https://www.redandblack.com/sports/scouting-report-vanderbilt/article_fe6b52f2-9253-11e6-b859-5f71ed1ae63e.html

Georgia will being on the 25-yard line with just under three minutes to drive down the field.6:19, 4th Quarter: Jacob Eason rushes for 20 yards, but it comes back due to a penalty. An Eason completion to Charlie Woerner is short of the first down, and Georgia will punt.9:43, 4th Quarter: Khari Blasingam has a two-yard carry for a Vanderbilt touchdown. Extra point is good.

Rodrigo Blankenship notched two field goals, with a long of 45 yards — by far Georgia's best of the year. Other than Blankenship, however, no other Bulldog has been able to put points on the board, as Georgia headed into the locker room with a one-point deficit against Vanderbilt.

Georgia's run game hasn't had much success, as it only accumulated 54 yards in the first half. And 17 of those came from quarterback Jacob Eason. Nick Chubb and Sony Michel are both averaging fewer than two yards per carry, which will need to improve if Georgia wants to pull ahead of the Commodores, who haven't beaten a Power Five opponent so far this year. In the air, Eason has 150 yards, a significant improvement from his 29-yard showing against South Carolina last weekend.0:02, 2nd Quarter: Rodrigo Blankenship is on the field to try a 54-yard field goal.

15-Oct-16,"Jacob Eason shines, but running backs struggle in loss","After a quarterback throws for 29 yards, usually the only direction to go is up. And that’s exactly where freshman quarterback Jacob Eason went during Saturday’s game against Vanderbilt.Despite the 17-16 loss to one of the worst teams in the Southeastern Conference, Eason went 27-for-40 for a career-high 346 yards and a touchdown.“He came out with confidence and was able to throw the ball,” head coach Kirby Smart said. “That was good to see.” 


 


One of the things that made this Eason performance better than the last couple was his ability to spread the ball out to several different receivers. Nine different Bulldogs caught a pass from Eason today. Leading the way for the receiving corps were two freshmen — Isaac Nauta, who hauled in five catches for 74 yards and Georgia’s lone touchdown, and Riley Ridley, who had five grabs for 67 yards. “It gives [Eason] confidence,” Smart said. “They gave him some things in some soft coverage we tried to take advantage of and we tried to implement some run-pass options but they took the run away so it made us one-dimensional.” Eason did miss a sure-touchdown on one throw. In the third quarter, Eason decided to take his second read and missed a wide-open Jayson Stanley down the sideline who could have walked into the end zone. “He thought the corner was sitting too high on that read,” Smart said. “I think he knows he missed that one.”Eason’s receivers also helped out the youngster with some good catches. Both Terry Godwin and Reggie Davis had to adjust themselves on slant routes and were able to locate the throws and catch first-down passes.The freshman threw the ball 40 times Saturday as opposed to the 17 times he threw it against South Carolina. A week ago, Georgia’s running game was carrying the team, however Saturday, the running game was its Achilles Heel.“Every team we play against, that is their standard, to stack the box,” said wide receiver Javon Wims, who had three catches for 32 yards. “We know we have help Jacob out because we are going to throw it a lot.” The Bulldogs gashed the Gamecocks for 326 rushing yards a week ago and were limited to just 75 yards against Vanderbilt. Conversely, a week ago the Commodores gave up 258 yards rushing to Kentucky.


 


“They were just loading the box and blitzing a lot,” offensive lineman Tyler Catalina said. “They knew our game plan after last week. They knew we wanted to run the ball.” Georgia had next-to-zero success trying to run the ball through the middle of the Vanderbilt front line. Vanderbilt’s defensive linemen jammed up the middle running lanes for Sony Michel and Nick Chubb, who ran for 28 yards on 13 carries and 40 yards on 16 carries, respectively. Smart said when Georgia was scouting Vanderbilt, Georgia called up teams the Commodores had played thus far and they all said the same thing. “They said their defensive linemen are big, physical and tough to move,” Smart said. “We wanted to set our jaw and hit them, but we weren’t able to do so.” Georgia tried running the ball on the outside using Isaiah McKenzie on several jet sweeps, which worked a good bit. He went for 14 yards on one jet sweep and 23 yards on another. As far as handing it off the running backs and allowing them to try and reach the edge, those types of runs were unsuccessful. One of the main reasons for that was Vanderbilt middle linebacker Zach Cunningham. The 6-foot-4, 235-pound, rangy linebacker was in on what seemed like every tackle. He recorded 19 of them on the day, including busting through an opening on a fourth-and-1 and tackling Isaiah McKenzie for no gain to seal the victory for Vanderbilt. “We expected to come out there and dominate after last week,” Catalina said. “It is what it is. They played harder than us.”",Alexander T.

20-Oct-16,A tale of two cities: Eleni Christofi transitions from Greece to Georgia,"Much about Eleni Christofi’s life has changed over the past six months, but the name of the city where she lives has not. Before committing to the Georgia women’s tennis team this year, Christofi was playing tennis in her hometown of Athens, but not the Athens that many Georgia students have come to know.No, Christofi’s Athens is 5,612 miles away from Athens, Ga.


 


Christofi’s Athens is in Greece.“I lived 10 minutes from the city’s center,” Christofi said. “It was the best location.”That means living a little over 10 minutes from one of the most beautiful cities of the ancient world.More so, being from the Grecian city meant Christofi grew up only a few miles from landmarks such as the Acropolis, the Parthenon and the temple of the city’s goddess protector, Athena.And while many Georgia fans would consider Sanford Stadium or the Arch to be sacred ground in Athens, Ga., Christofi lived her life in a sacred city of ancient Greek mythology.However, Christofi is happy to be in this new Athens and is ready for the opportunities that come along with being a student-athlete at the University of Georgia.Christofi is a graduate of Costeas-Geitonas School and her journey from Athens to Athens began this past May as she and her mother, Efi, visited Georgia for the first time.“Georgia was actually the third college that I visited,” Christofi said. “I remember the entire visit being really fun.”


 


Georgia women’s tennis head coach Jeff Wallace said that normally it is rather difficult to get international players, let alone their parents, to come for a visit, which is what surprised him about Christofi’s recruiting process. “A lot of international players don’t really get to make visits and some make visits but not with their parents,” Wallace said. “But Eleni was able to come and bring her mom too, so I thought she did a thorough job of looking around everywhere and making the right decision.”And as much as Christofi liked the city of Athens, Ga. itself, it was the people of Georgia that, she said, ultimately swayed her to make the decision to hop on a plane to join a team in Georgia.“[When I came for my visit] all the girls on the team were so friendly,” Christofi said. “I remember they made me feel like a part of the team even though [at the time of my visit] I wasn’t officially on the team yet.”But following her third college visit, Christofi and her mother returned home to Athens, Greece and quickly made a decision.“I felt like [the University of Georgia] was the right place for me,” Christofi said.And now three months into her freshman campaign, Christofi is bringing her international experience to the collegiate stage, which is something that her head coach finds to be the most exciting aspect of his newest player.  Before beginning her new life in a new city of Athens, the Georgia freshman competed in all four junior grand slam tournaments, the US Open, Wimbledon, the French Open and the Australian Open. She also reached the 2016 Wimbledon and French Open junior doubles quarterfinals.

“[Playing in international tournaments] means experience,” Wallace said. “There is no substitute in having experience from playing in big events, tournaments and matches. I think that is something that as time goes on, will really be beneficial for Eleni.”Ans while Christofi has had a multitude of years preparing and executing in major international tournaments, her focus right now is preparing for her first Saturday between the hedges.For her first college football game, Christofi is planning to tailgate along with 93 thousand other fans.And if you ask any of those fellow fans about the sacredness of a home Georgia football game, they would probably say that not even Athena’s Temple in Athens, Greece is as sacred as Sanford Stadium on a Saturday afternoon in Athens, Ga.But no matter what awaits Christofi between the hedges or in the rest of her time here at Georgia, she is excited about her move from one Athens to another and what opportunities she will find here in Athens, Ga.“This is a new life for me,” Christofi said. “But, so far, I like it.”","Tori McElhaney

21-Oct-16,Georgia equestrian prepares for doubleheader this weekend,"With the first meet and the first loss of the season in the rear-view mirror, Georgia’s equestrian team is ready for its home opener this weekend. It won’t be an average weekend for the team. Georgia will host a doubleheader with a meet against Tennessee-Martin on Saturday and New Mexico State on Sunday.The season opener loss against South Carolina came unexpectedly to the riders. Last season, Georgia defeated South Carolina both at home 13-5 and on the road 13-7. As a result of the loss, Georgia dropped one spot to No. 3 in the NCEA rankings. “We weren’t really expecting a loss at all,” senior Meg O’Mara said. “It was a little shocking because we haven’t lost against them in a long time.”


 


However, the drop in rankings doesn’t seem to bother the riders. This was Georgia’s first meet, while other schools have already had two or even four meets this season. Junior Bailey Anderson is personally focused on national championships, SEC championships and the end result of the season.With last weekend being a bye week, the riders have had two weeks to prepare for the home opener. This weekend will test both the riders’ and horses’ endurance. O’Mara believes that both the riders and horses will be tired. There are multiple riders who will be showing both days.“It’ll be a little bit draining, but this is what we’re training for,” O’Mara said. Head coach Meghan Boenig believes that the doubleheader will also change the fitness and exhaustion level. In practices leading up to this weekend, the riders and Boenig have reviewed videos and practiced multiple patterns in order to eliminate errors and penalties.A doubleheader requires the riders to prepare for multiple patterns. Mentally preparing to switch from one pattern on Saturday to the next pattern on Sunday has been a focus. Being at home also adds a different level of pressure. “As much as there’s some familiarity, I think there’s an increased strain and expectation of defending home turf, ” Boenig said.Mistakes made on Saturday can’t affect the riders’ performance on Sunday. Adjusting from one pattern to the next is key this weekend in order for the riders to come out with two wins under their belts. “If we do have mistakes on Saturday, learn from them, forget about them and move on so that we can compete to our fullest on Sunday,” Anderson said. “I’m excited to show them what we got back-to-back and pull out two wins right in a row.”

21-Oct-16,Project Condom showcase combines sex and style,"Fashion and fornication unite at Project Condom, a University of Georgia program where contestants design outfits made out of 1,000 condoms, aimed at educating the public on a specific theme associated with sexual health.Katy Janousek, the sexual health coordinator at the University of Georgia, was inspired to put on the sex education-based fashion show when an intern in 2008 communicated with the Student Health Services at the University of South Carolina.In its early days, Project Condom was wildly successful and brought in a large crowd. It included not only the fashion show, but also educational skits and drag shows, Janousek said.


 


“It was a celebration of sexuality,” she said.But as the show grew, so did the venue. The show eventually had to move to the Tate Grand Hall, which became expensive.“Everyone started showing up. This cost a lot of money,” Janousek said. “‘How are we going to offset the cost of a one-time show?’” In 2012, Janousek decided to charge money for the show. However, the admission cost resulted in low participation.“[I had to] put it on the shelf,” she said. “I needed to think about it.”Janousek still wants to motivate the public the educate themselves about safe sex. This year, there will be no models and no show, but rather mannequins featuring the competitor’s designs.Designer Madison Brumbaugh, a senior linguistics and sociology major from Brunswick, designed a kimono-style robe titled “The Morning After.” The idea behind her design was to promote awareness of what the health center offers, and to educate students on how morning-after pills function to prevent pregnancy.“The University Health Center offers emergency contraceptive, such as Plan B and ella, and I wanted to highlight this service with my design while also addressing the controversy surrounding emergency contraception,” Brumbaugh said.


 


Similarly, Danielle Lasker, a senior art major from Macon, designed a dress to resemble a nurse’s uniform, titled “Nurse Nonsense.”“I designed this garment as a nurse’s dress to highlight the discrimination against members of the LGBT community by blood donation organizations and regulations about the donation process,” she said.Lasker said her design pays tribute to the issue, especially in wake of the Pulse Nightclub shooting in June, where gay men were still restricted from donating blood.Each design will be featured at the UHC and the Scream on the Green event on Myers Quad on Oct. 20.Janousek said the show might return in the future, but raising the funds to do so would be the challenge. “Folks are still apprehensive to put dollars toward something that might conflict with personal values,” she said.Janousek said the goal of the show remains the same, hoping to destigmatize and normalize sex while still honoring those who choose to remain abstinent.“Creating visual messages related to sexual health is already considered scandalous and taboo, but adding in the medium of actual condoms truly adds an ‘in your face’ statement to highlight any concept a designer may have,” Lasker said.


TNCMS.AdManager.render({region: 'fixed-big-ad-bottom-asset', slot: 1, fold: ""below""});


Project Condom, combines with other programs such as the Condom Express delivery service, led to UGA's award of first place on the Trojan Sexual Health Report Card, of 140 schools in the nation that were evaluated.“In the 11 years we’ve conducted this study, we’ve seen big improvements in the 140 schools we’ve researched,” said Bert Sperling, creator of BestPlaces.net, which conducted the study and decided the rankings. “A rise in the rankings means that a school is outperforming other schools, which is an achievement of which to be proud.”The sexual Health Report Card takes into account health center accessibility, contraception availability, HIV and STD testing, sexual assault and counseling services, advice column or Q&A feature, counseling services, peer counseling, campus events and other outreach.No matter how the University Health Center takes on the challenge of educating its students, safe sex will never go out of style.","Mia Falcon

22-Oct-16,Georgia equestrian wins home opener against Tennessee-Martin,"The chilly winds didn’t seem to have an impact on Georgia equestrian for the home opener. Georgia defeated Tennessee-Martin 17-2 in its second meet of the season. With a quick turn-around time, precision and execution in new patterns tomorrow will need to be present for the team to acquire a second win. The team will take on New Mexico State tomorrow morning for its third meet of the season. “It felt great,” freshman Maddy Darst said. “I tried not really thinking about South Carolina and focused on today and the meet, a new day and a new feeling about how today was going to work out.” 


 


In hunt seat events, four of the six riders who competed rode in both equitation over fences and equitation on the flat. The team started off strong with a win in equitation over fences 4-1. Darst opened the meet up for Georgia with an impressive score of 81-71 against Tennessee-Martin’s Lauren Kinney. Not only did Darst win her point, she also had the highest score overall in equitation over fences.In equitation on the flat, Georgia had high scores across the board. Georgia won 4-0. Freshman Sydney Hutchins and Tennessee-Martin’s Randi LaChance tied 76-76, which resulted in Georgia claiming only four of the five possible points. Darst had the highest score overall in equitation on the flat as well with an 85-77 win over Tennessee-Martin’s Monica Zoromski. Darst’s performances in hunt seat events impressed the judges throughout the meet. The freshman’s high scores earned her MOP honors in both events.“I had good draws today so I was lucky,” Darst said. “I was able to figure them (the horses) out. I hadn’t ridden the one jumper before so that was a new horse for me, but she’s a great horse so I figured her out pretty quickly.”Georgia and Tennessee-Martin had close scores in horsemanship, but Georgia took home a 4-1 win. Junior Bailey Anderson had the highest score overall in horsemanship with a 73.5-72.5 win against Tennessee-Martin’s Brittany Woodard. Anderson’s mind was set on more than just riding for a win today.“[Head coach Meghan Boenig] talked a lot about how we’re dedicating today towards those who have been affected by breast cancer and to ride for them,” Anderson said. “Just thinking about them and doing it to the best of our ability.”Georgia gave Tennessee-Martin a beating in reining and swept them 5-0 bringing home the final points of the day. Sophomore Graysen Stroud claimed the first point and highest score overall in reining with a 71-67.5 win over Tennessee-Martin’s Sami Felts. Senior Claudia Spreng took home MOP honors in reining for her outstanding 69.5-66 ride and win against Tennessee-Martin’s Liana Nowak.“Wins always feel good, but I think if you treat them much different than a loss, then you’re in trouble,” Boenig said. “We can’t take the foot off the gas for tomorrow, and the next day and the next. There are always things we are working on to do better and I was pleased with the way the girls rode today.”

2-Nov-16,Frank Iero conveys raw emotions on new album 'Parachutes',"Frank Iero and The Patience’s album “Parachutes” was released only weeks after the band was in a severe car accident. Luckily, all members are stably recovering and were able to see their work fully come to fruition. The band also features a change in name as the group’s first album “Stomachaches” was released under the moniker Frank Iero and the Celebration, so although the new name still features the name of lead singer Frank Iero, who was the guitarist for the now disbanded group My Chemical Romance, it seems to mark a new phase in the band’s life. “Parachutes” may not have a typical soul sound, but it goes gut deep in content.The album opens with the grinding, war-like sounds of “World Destroyer.” Pulsing drums give the song a sound similar to firing bullets which plays into the track’s name. Iero switches between dirty and clean vocals, and allows his screams to sound like a war cry while a beeping sound in the background adds tension to the song’s chaos.


 


 “They Wanted Darkness…” starts at a moderate pace with a heavy bass sound. The guitar adds an eerie, ethereal quality to the song. About a third of the way through, the track begins to build anticipation through a quickened guitar riff in conjunction with the drums. Iero’s vocals are close which adds a sense of desperation to the lyrics “I’m breaking out of this, your darkness,” before he breaks into screams.The lyrics of “Remedy” contain a reference to the band’s first album “Stomachaches” with the line “I feel [emotions] radiate, gave me stomachaches.” This song in particular conveys the pain nestled at the core of the album. The vocals rip into screams early on, although they are not used consistently, and push the emotion of the lyrics to the forefront.The title of last track on the album “9-6-15” is interesting because as it is a date. The lyrics refer to Frank’s grandfather as both he and his father and died on September 6th. According to Iero’s lyrics, he was “the greatest man that ever lived.” The song begins mellow with the lead guitar picking a flowing riff and the presence clean vocals .The lyrics of this song are provocative— Iero sings of his grandfather’s death, “He left a void inside my world and I’ve felt this lost ever since.” Despite being incredibly personal, the emotions of the song are universal and lines like “I’ve been pretending, that I’m doing fine, not sure I did that great a job,” are especially relatable. The song transitions from its gentle guitar based sound to a grittier arrangement emphasized by pounding drums, aggressive strumming and Iero’s breaking vocals in order to convey and release the song’s pain.“Parachutes” leaves listeners intrigued by its war-worn darkness as the album is visceral and Iero’s vocals allow the emotions of the lyrics to cut deeply.",Anna Haas @teacupanna,culture,https://www.redandblack.com/culture/frank-iero-conveys-raw-emotions-on-new-album-parachutes/article_0778a090-a07b-11e6-bb32-ab1cdc71b735.html
3-Nov-16,"Jacknife Lee, producer behind, R.E.M., Taylor Swift, Weezer, comes to UGA","Jacknife Lee, whose real name is Garret Lee, is the writer and producer behind well-known artists like U2, R.E.M., Snow Patrol and Taylor Swift.Lee is coming to The University of Georgia on Nov. 3 – 4 as the inaugural Willson Center and Terry College Music Business Program Visiting Fellow. The producer and songwriter will have a discussion with Music Business Director, David Barbe, and will perform a DJ set at the 40 Watt Club later.The name “Jacknife” caught on when he started producing records and realized that he needed a stage name. Lee said it all began because his wife would call him “Jack.” After listening to the Radiohead song “Airbag” and hearing the lyrics “jacked knifed” Lee forgone his birth name and assumed the producing name of “Jacknife.” After that, groups like U2 began calling him by that, and it has stuck ever since.


 


Lee has always had a passion for music. In high school he would play gigs by himself, and later in the ’90s, he was the guitarist for the Dublin punk band Compulsion. Lee has done everything in the music industry from playing in punk bands to electronic bands as well as being a DJ. He has produced music for game shows, films and children’s music to name a few. “Whatever it took to not have to get a proper job, I did,” Lee said.  While few people ever realize their passions in life, Lee says that he is fortunate for always having known what he wanted to do. He jokes that he is not sure whether his devotion to music comes from stubbornness, passion or a combination of the two. “Makes life a bit easier when your passion becomes your career,” Lee said.The producer is coming to Athens as a guest of UGA’s Willson Center and Terry College of Music Business Program. Although, Lee admits that this is something he would have said no to previously in the past. Accepting to speak in front of this audience is part of an effort he is making to overcome some of the habits he has developed in the past few years, such as opting to decline offers. Lee says that saying no to interviews and speaking events in the past has probably been caused by some sort of subconscious fear.Bertis Downs, R.E.M.’s former manager and retired UGA Law professor, worked with Lee for R.E.M.’s last two albums “Accelerate” and “Collapse into Now.” Downs said that students and those in attendance will be able to learn a lot from attending Lee’s discussion with Barbe as his experiences are unique and tell both the trials and tribulations of the music industry.“He’s got a staggering resume of people he’s worked with in the last ten years. From Indie rock bands to major stars like Taylor Swift,” Downs said. For Lee, the best part about being a producer is making and listening to music all day. He recommends any aspiring musicians or students in the music program to follow their passions and pursue music— especially women.


 


“Run at it… If music doesn’t make you happy then don’t do it. If it does make you happy, then do nothing else,” Lee said.  Considering there are so few women in music production, Lee stresses the necessity of needing more women in the industry. There are so many aspects to become involved with in a music career from performing, to production or even sound. There is hardly one path, and Lee hopes that aspiring musicians and students continue to try as many things as they can to connect.“If you’re sitting with a banjo and you think ‘this is amazing’ then stick with the banjo. Keep on looking until you find something that resonates with you,” Lee said.The difficulties of the job arise when personalities of groups he works with clash. As a producer, he works to organize these groups and helps them focus on the important thing— making the music. Lee has even had to mediate with groups; his tip is to leave any baggage at the door and have everyone focus their energies on the projects.Even though Lee has become a successful and widely sought-after producer, he comments that  he has been broke for most of his music career. There were often times when he would go to the ATM and wonder whether or not he would have any money. The music industry has a lot of uncertainty, especially with pay, but that has not discouraged Lee from pursuing his passion.“Whatever you’re doing in your spare time, do as your career. If you find a way to do that then I think you’ll be happy,” Lee said. Lee’s inspiration for producing and writing music is constantly changing. He describes it as a carousel, where both new and sometimes previously forgotten ideas come in phases and resonate with something inside of him.Currently, Lee has been finding inspiration from rhythmic African beats and linear songs rather than pieces with chords or dynamic shifts. On Friday when he plays at the 40 Watt Club, he will be playing some of the African funk he has been listening to among a wide assortment of vinyls from his own collection.

“Mad mass of music – it’s like if a wedding DJ’s records all burnt in a fire. That’s what I’m playing,” Lee comments.Over the years, Lee has developed friendships with the bands he has worked with, like R.E.M. and Snow Patrol. Since he works from his home, the bands have become close with his family as well; often the bands’ children will hang out with Lee’s two daughters as they produce music, and Lee and his family have gone on vacation with R.E.M. and their families.  These working friendships translate into the music produced, as trust plays a key role in production. Lee has always encouraged these artists to produce something raw and uncomfortable, and in turn, the artists trust Lee’s direction and creativity.“They find strength in doing something that’s difficult,” Lee said.Outside of music, Lee’s life revolves around his two daughters and his wife. Music is a large part of his relationship with his daughters as well; for daddy-daughter dates Lee and his daughters often go record shopping. Lee said that he has even requested time off when he is in Athens so that he can go to Wuxtry Records and shop for him and his daughters. During the interview, Lee even had to go into another room as one of his daughters was playing a Talking Heads album too loud. He says there are drum kits and different instruments around the house as his daughters also have a passion for music. These days it seems that his two daughters influence his music taste more than he influences theirs.  “They have amazing taste in music,” Lee said.Lee’s music career has caused him to miss out on events with his family, but he reasons that music has caused more good than bad in his life.

“It’s more than noise,” Lee says referring to music. “It’s something else. There’s a spiritual aspect to it— I highly recommend it.”",Becca Beato @beccabeato,culture,https://www.redandblack.com/culture/jacknife-lee-producer-behind-r-e-m-taylor-swift-weezer/article_c40c4e52-a15f-11e6-9203-23e8ea826903.html
3-Nov-16,"Editor and founder of ""Cutthroat: A Journal of the Arts"" comes to UGA","From working with environmental causes to establishing a successful literary journal, Pamela Uschuk has a wide spread of influence over the literary community.This Thursday Nov. 3, Pamela Uschuk, the award-winning poet, editor and founder of the literary magazine “Cutthroat: A Journal of the Arts” will have a reading at the Zell B. Miller Learning Center room 350 at 4:30 p.m. The event is free and open to the public. Uschuk will be reading from her poetry books: “Blood Flower,” “Wild in the Plaza of Memory,” “Crazy Love” and “The Best of Cutthroat.” After her readings, she will discuss her editorial experiences as the founding editor and current editor-in-chief of “Cutthroat.”This event will be hosted by the Creative Writing Program and LeAnne Howe, an Eidson Distinguished Professor in American Literature here at the The University of Georgia. Howe describes Uschuk as a “very energetic writer and a generous poet.”Uschuk and Howe met approximately 16 years ago in Winston-Salem, N.C., according to Howe. At the time, Uschuk was the director for women’s writers at Salem College. Howe had a reading for her novel “Shell Shaker” and Uschuk was in attendance. The two writers have been in touch ever since and Uschuk has even published some of Howe’s work in “Cutthroat.”“[I had been] a long admirer of her work,” Uschuk said about Howe.In the summer of 2005, “Cutthroat” began to take form after Uschuk and her husband moved back to Colorado from North Carolina. The couple sat down to discuss their lives’ directions following her husband’s retirement, and it was in this conversation that they decided to start a literary magazine.Both Uschuk and her husband came up with the name “Cutthroat” which was inspired by the endangered species of cutthroat trout. This species of trout has to live in clean, unpolluted water, according to Uschuk. Writing, just as a cutthroat trout, needs an unpolluted and free environment in order to survive. “We were afraid that writing was an endangered species,” Uschuk said.The goal of Uschuk and her husband was to produce a magazine independent from any organizations or institutions. They did this to uphold the editorial integrity of the work and maintain the focus of the magazine on issues that matter.“Our idea for the magazine was to produce writing with an edge— especially humanity and politics,” Uschuk said.  The readings Uschuk will focus on this Thursday have ties to her personal life as she will cover southwestern themes, like immigration. Since Uschuk grew up in a Russian-Czech immigrant family, she is familiar with the hardships immigrant families face in order to become citizens.Uschuk’s humanitarian values also stem from her family, as her father was a union steward. Her father worked in an automobile factory in Michigan and as a steward, it was his job to defend and represent his fellow factory workers from injustices. It is from here that Uschuk and her family began their long history fighting for justice.The writer and editor has also worked with environmental causes to further her passions. Uschuk writes wilderness articles, especially about wolves, wilderness preservation and species preservation.Other than catering to politics and the humanities, “Cutthroat” has cultivated emerging and established writers in its past 21 issues with writers like Michael Martone, Naomi Shihab Nye and Rita Dove. As a magazine, it has maintained its independent stance and has protected the creative freedoms of the writers for the past 11 years.Howe said the decision to host Uschuk was in the spirit of unifying the nation. “During this election season, unifying east and west wouldn’t be a bad thing to have here at UGA,” Howe said

5-Nov-16,"Georgia Congressman John Lewis, actress Danai Gurira speak to volunteers at Clarke County Democratic Committee","Members of the Clarke County Democratic Committee could not emphasize enough how close polls show the race in Georgia between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump.Close to 100 people crowded into the CCDC headquarters on Baxter Street Saturday afternoon to learn how to volunteer, knock on doors and phone bank for Clinton, the Democratic presidential nominee.""Georgia is demographically a blue state,"" one speaker said. ""It's completely about turnout.""


 


Organizers told those in the audience that, despite a sense that an individual vote does not have much of an impact on the overall outcome of an election, voter participation is more crucial than ever.""The mindset that your vote doesn't matter in Georgia is long since past,"" one of the speakers told the crowd.

6-Nov-16,Greek organizations at UGA use GreekLifeEdu online course during initiation,"Before orientation, the University of Georgia hands incoming freshmen a to-do list to prepare them for the incoming year.In addition to practicalities like memorizing student ID numbers, students must also complete AlcoholEdu and Haven, online programs by EverFi that teach safe drinking habits and sexual assault prevention.And now, some UGA students also have to complete GreekLifeEdu, another EverFi course that focuses on similar topics like alcohol awareness, sexual assault and hazing.


 


Molly Burke, associate director at EverFi, said 34 Greek organizations across the nation — 20 of which have UGA chapters — are requiring their incoming members to do the program.According to the website, GreekLifeEdu focuses on individual values and actions to promote planning to keep students safe and responsible in their Greek organizations. The program does so through interactive scenarios and ""visually stimulating"" lessons.Claudia Shamp, the director of Greek life at UGA, said the university itself does not require new Greek life members to take the course. Instead, UGA hosts local seminars and workshops and require different chapter officers to attend and recommend others to participate as well. Specific fraternities or sororities may additionally require their members to complete GreekLifeEdu.“We’re here and our groups are here, so we can bring speakers in and do one-on-one educational programs with our fraternity and sorority members,” Shamp said.She said since national organizations are headquartered across the country, GreekLifeEdu is an efficient way to make sure sorority or fraternity members receive the education.“In some cases, if a certain percentage of members complete the course, chapters can receive an insurance credit, which in turn boosts completion rates,” Burke said.EverFi is not partnered with any Greek life insurance companies, she said, and any incentives for fraternities and sororities to complete the program are not promoted by EverFi.Certain organizations also use GreekLifeEdu as part of their initiation process.


 


Zeta Tau Alpha and Delta Zeta are among the sororities with UGA chapters that use the program. Mandi Evans, associate executive director at the Delta Zeta headquarters, said the sorority started using the program as an initiation requirement when they partnered with EverFi in 2006.“Delta Zeta adopted GreekLifeEdu as part of our overall awareness, education and prevention efforts regarding risk issues,” Evans said. “It has provided a positive educational experience for our new members, and we are proud to partner with EverFi for this product.”Claudia Goodwin, a freshman business major from Woodstock, rushed Delta Zeta at the beginning of the school year. In order to become a member, she had to complete the program within the first month of receiving a bid.Shamp pointed out that using an online program is an efficient way to relay information, but Goodwin questions the effectiveness of these courses.“I did learn some things,” she said. “But I mostly just kept clicking because if I actually took the time to read and listen to everything, it would have been endless hours.”Shamp said she is unsure about the program’s effect on preventing hazing or sexual assault and declined to comment on any UGA cases or trends regarding these issues.There has been little general research on success rates for online courses, and experts debate the effectiveness of such courses over in-person instruction.James Castle, lead instructional designer at the Office of Online Learning at UGA, said there were studies done in the early 2000s which compared online and face-to-face learning.


TNCMS.AdManager.render({region: 'fixed-big-ad-bottom-asset', slot: 1, fold: ""below""});


In 2010 the Department of Education did a meta-analysis of multiple studies which showed the two methods have similar success rates.“Anecdotally, we talk to faculty and we hear that typically their online and face-to-face classes are pretty much on par,” Castle said.Though the effectiveness of online courses is unclear, Burke said GreekLifeEdu collaborated with experts in sociology like Dr. Alan Berkowitz, author of “Response Ability: A Complete Guide to Bystander Intervention,” to engage students.“EverFi completes comprehensive reviews of course data to ensure the program’s effectiveness,” Burke said.","Erin Schilling

6-Nov-16,Review: Portugal. The Man comes to Georgia Theatre,"Casper: A noteworthy talent  Before Portugal. The Man took the stage, a German rapper known by the stage name Casper gave a musical performance that was as memorable as the concert that followed. He grew up in Augusta, Ga., which explains why he could flawlessly transition from rapping in German to conversing with the crowd in English. His tour with the band is his first ever performance in America.“At first I didn’t know what to do. Then one friend said, with American rap nowadays you aren’t gonna understand a word anyways.”


 


Casper spit lyrics with believable intensity and emotion that the audience could feel even though it was in a different language. He bounded across the stage fueled by a fiery energy that perfectly primed the crowd for the band’s entrance afterwards.In between songs, Casper described how he asked Portugal if he could go on tour with them. “I didn’t think these guys would ever respond to it but they answered like f*** yeah I’ll go on tour with you— and it was amazing because I got to see one of my favorite bands every night.”Portugal. The Man: The tunesThe night officially started with a rousing rendition of “Church Mouth.” John Gourley’s iconic voice rushed to the highest falsetto and back down again, dizzyingly winding its way around the heavy drums and bass that create the band’s psychedelic-rock sound.During the popular song “Creep in a T-Shirt,” bass player Zach Carothers energetically turned round in circles, throwing his head back and twisting his body around the bass. Meanwhile the jangly keyboard notes played that dominate amid lyrics like, “Sorry but I don’t recall the crime, my memory has left me behind.” The highlight of the evening was when the band announced a new song from its upcoming album “Doomin’ and Gloomin’.” Fans have been eagerly awaiting word on the album since images were first released of the band back in the recording studio in 2014. The spirited sound of the new song is more hype than the band’s past releases —the song never let go of a high-energy fervor that made the crowd bang their heads and jam along to the edgy, upbeat vibe. The new sound of the song could be foreshadowing an even more trippy version of Portugal after the prospective release of the new album.  The vibes


 


The Georgia Theatre fits a large crowd yet it maintains a hazy, intimate atmosphere that is conducive to Portugal’s alternative sound. During the concert, the space transformed into an otherworldly indigo-toned, hazy cloud where strangers came together into one swaying and grooving conglomerate. Near the end of the concert, the band called out amid hollers from the crowd that the theatre is one of its favorite venues to perform.The band decked the stage out in strings of neon lights that rhythmically flashed along with the music and faded into different colors as songs were played. The lamps were highlighted by high-wattage spot lights that alternated between drowning the stage in darkness and lighting the theatre in a strobe-like effect.Notably, during the song “Purple Yellow Red and Blue,” the lanterns alternated between illuminating the stage in those exact colors, bringing the lyrics and the physical experience of the concert full circle.The band chose to paint a black alien-demon onto the face of a large drumset. The image is reminiscent of Gourley’s artwork for the most recent album, “Evil Friends”and mirrors the warm yet unsettling sound that is unique to Portugal. The Man.NostalgiaThe feeling that encompassed everyone the day after Portugal. The Man’s tour bus departed from Athens as fans eagerly await another concert. Hopefully the next time Athens sees Portugal on tour will be in amplification of the release of the new album. As if in direct response to fans’ wishes, the song “Louder” by Drunken Masters featuring Portugal. The Man was released on Spotify a day after the concert.",Nicole Schlabach @nicoleshakalaka,culture,https://www.redandblack.com/culture/review-portugal-the-man-comes-to-georgia-theatre/article_a27a3818-a451-11e6-8533-9f2ed3f50ce8.html
8-Nov-16,BREAKING: Johnny Isakson wins 2016 U.S. Senate race in Georgia,"On Tuesday evening, Johnny Isakson was announced as the winner of the 2-2016 race for the Georgia seat in the U.S. Senate.Though often overshadowed by the presidential election, the race for the Georgia seat in the U.S. Senate had its fair share of competition between the candidates.Democrat Jim Barksdale and Libertarian Allen Buckley both ran campaigns eager to dismantle the Republican stronghold that leaders such as Johnny Isakson and Nathan Deal have previously held over the state. From the beginning, this was a difficult challenge for a state that has not supported a Democratic presidential candidate since 1992.


 


However, in the year of a Donald Trump candidacy, nothing was certain this election cycle in Georgia. In the months leading up to the election, many political science experts noted that Georgia had the potential to be a swing state, and go against its recent history of republican loyalty.By tying Senator Isakson to Donald Trump, a polarizing political candidate even within the “red state” of Georgia, Barksdale hoped to garner enough support to detract from Isakson’s incumbent advantage.However, Isakson did not rebuke the ties to Trump, and instead emphasized his loyalty to his party and its candidate. Isakson also encouraged other Republicans and Georgians to do the same and to “volunteer for the Army of America.”By the end of the race, both candidates sought to take as many points as possible from their competitor, in hopes of a runoff race. Had Isakson not earned over 50 percent of the vote, a nine-week runoff would have kept the race going into the new year.","Grace Walker

10-Nov-16,Georgia equestrian to compete against defending national champion,"On Friday, Georgia equestrian will have one of its toughest meets of the season. No. 2 Auburn, the 2016 NCEA national champions, will go head-to-head with No. 4 Georgia at the UGA Equestrian Complex. Last weekend, Georgia traveled to Texas A&M, but returned home with its second loss of the season. The team is now 2-2 with the hopes of claiming its third win of the season on Friday.“We’ve been working really hard to prepare for Auburn,” sophomore Graysen Stroud said. “Texas A&M is ranked No. 1 right now, but Auburn is really the one to beat for us. It was really hard, but we learn from our mistakes and we’re stronger now.” 


 


During their performances at Texas A&M, some riders made judgment calls with their horses and weren’t able to “protect” certain elements of a pattern. Stroud believes there were horses that didn’t pick up on specific cues made by the riders and the riders pushed it in hopes of receiving a higher score. Riders who weren’t able to execute those elements were penalized and lost their point.Auburn, on the other hand, defeated Texas A&M this season. Auburn is 3-1 overall and has a 1-0 record in the Southeastern Conference. Georgia will be Auburn’s second SEC opponent this season. Georgia head coach Meghan Boenig believes that Auburn’s well-coached and talented riders give them an edge.“I think that they’re going to come out hitting,” Boenig said. “They come out with a lot of bravado. You’re only better by those that you compete against so this will bring out the best and the worst in all of us and that’s always an exciting thing to see.”In practice, Georgia has focused on perfecting every aspect of riding. Boenig has worked on leads and gaits with the team so that there aren’t any errors on Friday. The coaches aren’t able to watch all of the riders at once so the riders have been critiquing each other. They have worked on getting out of their comfort zones as well.“We are all working together as a team and pushing each other to be the best that we can,” Stroud said. “This week I’ve seen a big improvement.” The riders can’t allow themselves to think that Auburn is better than they are. Stroud believes that the team might lack confidence at times when competing against a strong team, but can’t forget Georgia has the ability to win. In this format, confidence in every moment of a ride is important. Judges look for riders who perform with confidence.Freshman Maddy Darst believes that the team’s determination and focus on both its strengths and weaknesses throughout practice is what sets the riders apart from Auburn. If the outcome doesn’t go as planned, the riders need to keep their heads high and focus on the future, Darst said.“It’s very easy to be either over or under hyped,” Boenig said. “What we need to do is treat this like the next opportunity to show off what we’ve learned from A&M and through this week of practice.”

10-Nov-16,Three future Gymdogs sign National Letters of Intent,"Three future Gymdogs — Ashley Foss, Marissa Oakley and Emily Schild — signed their National Letters of Intent on Wednesday. An NLI is a binding agreement where the athlete agrees to attend the school and the university agrees to provide athletics financial aid.Two other gymnasts, Samantha Durante and Madison McPherson, are also expected to join the team next season.“The 2017 class is a very complete and well-rounded class,” head coach Danna Durante said of the signees. “They have a high skill level on all four events. Their work ethic is through the roof and their competitive nature as a group really stands out.""


 


These gymnasts will begin competing for Georgia in the spring of 2018. Among the new recruits, they bring Junior Olympic and elite experience to their newfound team.Oakley, from Huntersville, North Carolina, trains at Everest Gymnastics, along with Schild. Oakley was a level 10 national qualifier from 2011-2014, which is the top meet at the highest J.O. level. She also competed in elite meets, such as the 2014 P&G Championships and the 2014 Secret U.S. Classic.One of the aspects Oakley is most excited about for collegiate gymnastics is competition as a team instead of individually. She is looking forward to the team atmosphere and the support that environment offers.“I’ve been to a few meets in Stegeman, and the crowd is just so incredible,” Oakley said. “I am just so excited to compete in front of that crowd, and just to have all that energy and excitement, I think will be really fun.”Schild, who trains with Oakley at Everest Gymnastics, said she also is excited about experiencing the team atmosphere in competition.Schild was one of 14 U.S. gymnasts to compete at the 2016 Olympic Trials, where she tied for the seventh highest score on vault. She also represented the United States internationally at both the 2015 and 2016 Jesolo Trophy and the 2015 Pan-American Games in Canada.Schild said that throughout her elite training, she learned certain skills she thinks she can incorporate into her collegiate routines. Paired with her development of mental toughness, Schild said she thinks her skills and mentality will prepare her for her career as a Gymdog.


 


Foss, a New Jersey native, trains at North Stars Gymnastics. Foss also is a level 10 gymnast, and in 2016 she was the J.O. national beam champion. Foss also has competed as an elite at competitions such as the 2012 and 2013 Secret U.S. Classics and the 2012 Visa Championships.Foss said she knew Georgia was the school for her when she stepped onto campus at the beginning of her eighth grade year. She is excited about committing to Georgia, especially after a chance to meet the team.“I actually didn’t know them until I met them on my visit,” Foss said. “They are all so sweet, so supportive and so loving.”Samantha Durante, daughter of head coach Danna Durante, competed at J.O. nationals in both 2014 and 2015. In 2014, she placed fourth on bars. McPherson trains alongside Samantha at Georgia Elite Gymnastics in Watkinsville and has competed at level 10 regionals multiple times. McPherson was previously planning to compete for Texas Women’s University.Morgan Reynolds and former Gymdog Lindsey Cheek trained at Georgia Elite Gymnastics during their club careers.""We’re thrilled to have them join our Gymdog family and watching them continue their athletic careers here,"" Durante said of the signees. ""We’re excited to be a part of their journey of personal growth as we prepare them for the next chapter of their life.”",Kelsey Russo @kelseyyrusso,sports,https://www.redandblack.com/sports/three-future-gymdogs-sign-national-letters-of-intent/article_77d36794-a76a-11e6-a6e1-bb5596852c8a.html
15-Nov-16,"Students discuss gender identity, pronouns as part of Transgender Awareness Week","For Transgender Awareness Week, the LGBT Resource Center held a training session in Tate Student Center Monday evening for students to discuss various topics concerning gender and how it relates in their lives.A diverse group of close to 40 students gathered and talked about gender identity, preferred pronouns and influential family members.The presentation was led by Jacklyn J. Byrd, a human development and family and consumer science major from Decatur and student worker at the Intersection in the Tate Student Center.


 


“This event really highlights the needs of an at-risk population at UGA, the transgender and gender non-conforming community,” Byrd said.The group first took a moment to address pronouns, which some said can be confusing for someone outside of the transgender community. Students shared which pronouns they preferred, and reiterated that a person could always ask which pronouns they like better, as well as why it matters to them.“I identity as agender, so I’m not worried how masculinity and femininity applies to me,” said Kai Yost, a freshman film major from Smyrna. ”I can be myself and not be bothered about anything else, and they/them pronouns reflect that belief.”After the introduction, the students split into five small groups. Each group was assigned a subject relating to gender in the modern world to consider, and later presented their conclusions to the rest of the students, with the floor open for additional comments.Many of the presentations shed light on problems faced by transgender community that may not be discussed often or openly in the public sphere.One issue was how gender looks in context of white supremacy. A transgender African-American may face harsher judgement from society than a transgender Caucasian, according to one of the groups.“Being someone of color already leads them to be marginalized and adding the concept of gender further marginalizes those individuals,” said Rielly Beckner, a freshman English and psychology major from Summerville.


 


The presentation also explored how gender roles are shaped by cultural, social and familial backgrounds.One group explained how the concepts of gender are formed during the earliest stages of life by the adults people are primarily exposed to, such as parents, teachers, and other role models. The media and other outlets also reinforce these gender roles leading some to feel trapped.“Our campus is a big space. Not everyone knows what’s going on. Not everyone is aware of the LGBT Resource Center. Not everyone is comfortable coming out as well,” Byrd said. “I think that’s one of the reasons we have Transgender Awareness Week.”The next event will be a keynote presentation by Lucia Leandro Gimeno on Wednesday at 6:30 p.m. in the Tate Student Center.","Whit Carpenter

15-Nov-16,UGA LGBT Resource Center to host events for Transgender Awareness Week,"In honor of Transgender Awareness Week, the LGBT Resource Center at the University of Georgia will host three events to remember and raise awareness for the transgender community.The center, established in 2005, provides a supportive community for LGBTQA students and access to developmental resources offered at the University of Georgia, according to its website.Throughout the year, the center hosts a number of programs and services to provide a deeper understanding of issues related to gender identity, expression, and sexual orientation, but this week stands out.


 


“Transgender Awareness Week highlights the people that fought so hard for transgender rights and also gives the students on campus who are transgender a place where they feel comfortable,” said Arija Haynes, a volunteer at the LGBT Resource Center.On Monday evening, the center held a transgender and gender non-conforming allyship training session in the Tate Student Center. Haynes said the goal of the event was to inform attendants how to be supportive of transgender people.On Wednesday, Lucia Leandro Gimeno will provide a keynote presentation in the Tate Student Center at 6:30 p.m.Gimeno is an Afro-Latinx, trans masculine femme bruja/organizer and a graduate of Columbia University. Gimeno has spent more than 20 years working with the LGBTQ people of color community and allied communities in multiple cities including New York City and Atlanta, according to a schedule of events from the LGBT Resource Center.The week will culminate with a vigil on the Transgender Day of Remembrance on Nov. 19 at 11 a.m, which will act as a moment to remember those whose lives were lost due to anti-transgender violence in the past year.“The vigil shows that we are a community that is open for the transgender people,” Haynes said.","Whit Carpenter

16-Nov-16,Usry pushed others to live life to the fullest,"When Jack Usry glided into a room, he was barefoot, smiling and prepared for whatever adventure the day presented him. Whether it was a wild night in with his roommates or a sporadic trip outdoors, Usry brought anyone and everyone who embarked in these daily escapades with him a renewed joy for life.“He had a special way of bringing people together,” said Alex Kimball, a close friend and University of Georgia student. “What started as a casual night of homework would end up in a night of every person in Pineview filtering through his apartment.” don't mess with my pineview packA photo posted by jack usry (@jackusry) on Dec 4, 2015 at 9:41am PST


 


Usry died Nov. 4 in New York. Kimball, as well as the other lives Usry touched, are unable to forget the sense of exuberance he brought, said Allie Garland, another close friend and student.One of the traits that guided Usry’s life was his unstoppable adoration for photography. Garland and Usry’s roommate James Reno said it was rare to not find Usry with his camera, snapping pictures throughout the day.“He always had his speaker and camera ready to go in case an adventure arose — and with Jack it always did,” Garland said. until next time boys, keep grindin'A photo posted by jack usry (@jackusry) on Dec 17, 2014 at 12:48pm PSTHis adoration for the craft motivated not only his decision to major in art, but his study abroad trip to Cortona, Italy in summer 2016.


 


“He made it his goal at the very beginning to get to know every single person on the trip,” said Margaret Anderson, a close friend. “He made so many new friends and loved all the adventures he had.”Kimball recalls when Usry bought boxed wine for everyone to drink in Cortona among others who were drinking fine wine instead. He said it still brings people together today.“By the end of the program, the majority of us were drinking boxed wine at the wine tastings, and Jack was notorious among the wine connoisseurs,” Kimball said. thanks cortona, for every stumble, shift & swayA photo posted by jack usry (@jackusry) on Jul 30, 2016 at 10:09am PDTUsry focused on living life to the fullest within his friendships.“You could be completely yourself around him,” said Madison Riebock, one of Usry’s friends. “You could bring all your weirdness to the table and he would accept it in stride and then invite you on his next adventure.”“He’d make you feel like you were living life a little more than you were yesterday,” Garland said.

16-Nov-16,Georgia track and field nets big haul in early signing period,"Georgia track and field head coach Petros Kyprianou announced on Wednesday that the team has signed six student-athletes during this season’s early signing period. “This is a great time to be a Georgia track and field Bulldog,” said Kyprianou. “I am extremely proud to welcome arguably the most quality early signing class in our history.” That signing class will bring in two athletes for the women’s team, while the remaining four signees will compete for the men’s team. This is a promising development for the Bulldog program, which is primed to begin their 2017 indoor season in January. 


 


Tara Davis, of Agoura Hills, California, has shown the versatility to compete well in multiple events. She has recorded the top long jump in the country, at 21 feet 1/4 inches, and also the top triple jump in the nation at 43-2. Davis also won the long jump title at the 2015 World Youth Championships. “Tara is a very special kind of athlete as she has shown elite performances in three different events,” Kyprianou said.In Lynna Irby, the Bulldogs are adding the Gatorade Indiana Track and Field Athlete of the Year. During her time at Pike High School in Indianapolis, Irby won the 400m title at the 2016 New Balance Outdoor Nationals and finished second in the same event at the 2016 World Junior Championships. The Bulldogs’ men’s team also netted a pair of international decathletes for this recruiting class in Johannes Erm and Tristan Jonsson.Jonsson, of Reykjavik, Iceland, was a Junior World Championships finalist in the decathlon. He is the son of former Georgia Bulldog Jon Arnar Magnusson. Erm is headed to Athens by way of Tallinn, Estonia and holds the country’s best junior score in the decathlon at 7,879, which he scored in the 2016 World Junior Championships. “Continuing the Estonian domination in the decathlon world scene, Johannes is the best decathlete in the world in his age group and has the tools to potentially break Erki Nool’s Estonian national record.” Kyprianou said. Justes Nance, who attends Blair Academy in Blairstown, NJ, stands 6-foot-5 and is the top ranked high school long jumper. His personal record is 25 feet.


 


The men’s class is rounded out by Georgia native Ryne Bevan. Competing at North Paulding High School, Bevan’s best time ranks fifth nationally in the 800m at 1:51.67. “My philosophy and ambition since day one as a head coach was to base our efforts in recruiting only quality student-athletes who can be a great fit socially and academically and develop into Olympians and great citizens.” Kyprianou said. “Our coaches had this in their minds when signing this group.”","Collin Huguley

17-Nov-16,Transgender students recognize Awareness Week: Experiences differ in defining gender identity on a southern campus,"For Mars Hallman, Nov. 20 is a day of reflection. As many Americans look forward to Thanksgiving feasts, Hallman and thousands of transgender people will take a moment to acknowledge those who have lost their lives because of their gender identity.“The Trans Day of Remembrance isn’t just a weird holiday for us,” he said. “It’s one of our most solemn days of the year.”The holiday is in memorial of Rita Hester, an African-American transgender woman who was murdered in 1998.


 


“Her legacy is what brings us together this week of the year,” Hallman said.Leading up to the day of remembrance, transgender students, as well as their LGBT and non-LGBT peers and friends, are bringing attention to the awareness of transgender lives at the University of Georgia as part of Transgender Student Awareness Week.Raising awareness is especially important for Hallman, a freshman international affairs and Arabic language student from Nashville, Georgia. He comes from a small town where LGBT education is lacking.“When I lived in Covington, it wasn’t easy to talk about. There was no Gay-Straight Alliance at my school. There were no real resources made available to me at that age,” he said. “When I got to Nashville, Georgia, it was the same situation with no educational resources made available to me, but with an added layer of direct threats to my safety from my peers.”
                       +3 
                       











In his time at UGA, Hallman has taken action in support of the LGBT community through joining the Lambda Alliance. 


Katelyn Umholtz 


This pushed him to start the first Gay-Straight Alliance in Nashville. Continuing with Hallman’s advocacy push, he has become the educational director for Lambda Alliance, which will be official next semester. One of his first unofficial duties was to spread knowledge about Transgender Student Awareness Week. After events throughout the week, the LGBT Resource Center will hold a vigil at 11 a.m. Nov. 18 at the Tate Student Center to remember transgender lives lost to violence.


 


The week is also important because it highlights the experiences of transgender students, which differs from person to person.At first, Amy Jackson, a senior English major from Cumming, found coming out on campus to be fairly easy and people to be accommodating of her decision.“I came out at the tail end of last semester,” Jackson said. “It happened pretty quickly and almost by accident. I was experimenting with wearing different kinds of clothes and stuff earlier this year, and I was trying to slowly transition, but people kept showing up at my house and so I sort of came out all at once.”Jackson takes advantage of the LGBT Resource Center to help her manage the social changes she has been facing, but said this semester has been significantly more difficult.“The process of coming out was fairly easy. Being out is a different story,” she said. “I have a lot of issues with street harassment this semester. I mean, I get street harassed everywhere I go, but that’s just being a woman, right?”Hallman said though he knows all experiences are different, he thinks his is more common among transgender people. “I called myself transgender at about 14 and have been further exploring and strengthening my identity,” Hallman said. “I’ve experienced being transgender in a variety of settings — both rural and urban.”

Though Hallman’s experience coming out and being out as transgender was difficult, especially in rural south Georgia, the experience changed when coming to UGA last August — for the better. “The change between where I came from and where I am now is radical,” he said. “Every aspect of my life has been completely transformed. The presence of gender neutral bathrooms has made me feel safer and more welcomed here. I have teachers who ask for pronouns.”For Jackson, all of her transgender experiences have been at UGA. It is still a new transition, which has made it difficult to explain the significance of being transgender at the university. “I am still untangling what it means to be a transgender student here,” Jackson said.She said the stress that has come with her new transition stems mainly from the harassment she faces on campus and downtown, and the election has only heightened the comments she receives.“I have received actual threats at times, on campus and more downtown. That’s sort of concerning,” Jackson said. “There was definitely a spike in the weeks leading up to the election and then after, so that’s been a problem.”A LGBT liaison through CAPS at the university has been helping Jackson a few times per week, which she said has been helpful to her mental state, but she still cannot ignore the discomfort she faces each day. “I’m not trying to suggest that anyone is a transphobe, but there have been professors and classmates that you can tell don’t get it,” she said. “It’s not something I can totally explain, but there is just a certain level of comfort there that I am not really getting.”

When Donald Trump was elected as president on Nov. 8, Jackson found some humor in a few of the comments people made toward her. “I got a lot of street harassment comments that were like ‘Your time is up’ sort of comments,” she said. “There was one guy in particular on campus who got in his pickup truck to yell at me ‘Hey! Trump won!’ and that’s all he said. Maybe he was trying to be a modern-day town crier and maybe he thought I should have this information.”Among the LGBT community, Hallman said it has prepared already for the next four years, which includes pushing more advocacy of acceptance. The election results were also hard for Hallman to swallow, he said, but he never let the results bring him down.

“One thing people are really worried about is marriage equality being revoked. That’s a Supreme Court ruling, and a single presidency cannot undo a Supreme Court ruling,” he said. “But before young queer people fall into total despair, just realize that we need to advocate a little more now, but we won’t lose generations of progress in one term.”Jackson said while she is still trying to figure out her place on campus, she has plans to increase resources on campus for transgender students.“If we could talk about issues in terms of legality and social standing, then I think we can spin that into something positive with this week,” she said. “I would like to get toward an academic resource for LGBT people, which from what I have found doesn’t exist. There’s those social resources, but what happens to you socially also affects your academics.”","Katelyn Umholtz and Charlotte Norsworthy

20-Nov-16,UGA students gather for vigil honoring transgender lives,"For Rielly Beckner, it was a solemn moment.Beckner, a freshman english and psychology major at the University of Georgia and a volunteer at the UGA LGBT Resource Center, stood beside two others students in front of a crowd of close to 20 others students, reading off the names of the transgender people who had been killed in the United States in 2016.Alternating between the three readers, the students called out the name of each of the 25 victims as a picture of each one displayed on the projector screen behind them.


 


""It's very sad that transgender people's lives aren't taken seriously by society, but I appreciate the opportunity to stand up there and make sure they're remembered,"" Beckner said.After all the names had been listed, the entire room bowed their heads for 250 seconds of silence, 10 seconds for each of those that were killed.The vigil, held in the Tate Student Center on Friday, concluded Transgender Awareness Week, a national week of observance of transgender people and what they experience, as well as education about what it means to be transgender.""I feel like in the queer community, we're so focused on gay marriage and gay adoption and things like that that we tend to forget about the injustices and negative things going on in the background,"" said Ses Real, a student at UGA and the liaison for Prism, a discussion group for students who identify as LGBTQA and as a person of color.Though gay, lesbian and bisexual people are also targeted for their sexuality, Real said there is a lot more physical violence against transgender people.""I feel like this is needed to show that and not just sweep it under the rug,"" she said.Beckner said they saw the week as a way to bring awareness to the issue.""For me, it's a chance to advocate for my own cause and a chance to bring awareness to other people in situations similar to mine,"" Beckner said.


 


As someone who identifies as transgender, coming to UGA as a freshman was a new experience for Beckner.""This is my first experience being out in a setting other than my home,"" they said. Beckner was not ""out"" at their high school in Summerville, Georgia.Beckner said the people at the university have been generally accepting of their identity, but the professors are often ""a bit uninformed."" Beckner sees Transgender Awareness Week as a way to educate them.""Events like these for Transgender Awareness Week help get the word out,"" they said. ""But I've also spent time talking to other people and professors about what being trans is and about pronouns. And just my existence, as a gender non-conforming, non-binary person will help a lot of people understand that 'Oh, I do know a transgender person. This is what their life is like.'""The crowd at the vigil was noticeably small, something Real said Prism and other organizations are trying to improve.""We still have people who can't accept these things. A lot of the people that show up to these events are involved in the LGBT Resource Center already, or identify with those identities and want to see themselves represented, want to see their cause talked about,"" she said. ""The people we need to get in here are still so afraid of that that they don't come, or they come and pass.""Real said the LGBT Resource Center has been holding several events in an attempt to spark a conversation and inspire the general student body to come and learn about what it means to identify as non-binary and gender non-conforming.""I think each year we get a little closer to that,"" she said. ""We have more attendance now than last year, which was more than the year before, but I think it's a slow progress.""


TNCMS.AdManager.render({region: 'fixed-big-ad-bottom-asset', slot: 1, fold: ""below""});


Real cited issues at the university she feels are restricting progress, including the University Health Center denying students hormones and the complicated process students have to go through to change their names.""There are trans people who won't use their email address because it shows their birth name and not the name they've chosen,"" she said.At the same time, Real said she feels the university has made other moves toward accommodating the LGBT community, such as the Student Government Association bill which brought gender-neutral bathrooms to certain buildings around campus.""I feel like we're making steps towards [those changes], but it's been a long time coming and it's been a hard-fought battle,"" she said.Beckner also spoke of progress, feeling people are becoming more aware of the transgender community, but the general public is ""not yet"" accepting of it.Beckner feels UGA is an accepting community, but ""certainly has room to grow,"" advocating for more awareness and interaction with the cisgender community.""I feel like people are generally willing to learn, but they don't know currently,"" they said. ""So, ignorant, but working on it.""","Nate Harris

20-Nov-16,Georgia women’s basketball loses first game of the season,"After trailing for most of the game, the Georgia women’s basketball team lost its first game of the season. Georgia Tech beat the Bulldogs 52-45 on Sunday at McCamish Pavilion for the first time since 2010.Georgia (3-1) took its first lead of the game after a junior forward Mackenzie Engram jumper midway through the third quarter. From that point on, the game was back-and-forth until the Yellow Jackets (4-0) took a 43-41 lead late in the fourth quarter.Senior guard Shanea Armbrister then drove for a lay-up to tie the game with 7:17 left in the quarter, but Georgia was only able to score two more points the rest of the way, which came off free throws from redshirt senior forward Pachis Roberts.


 


The Bulldogs were held scoreless for the last 6:44 of the game.Caliya Robinson led the team in scoring for the second time this season with 15 points and recorded a double-double after tallying 10 rebounds as well. She did, however, have nine turnovers in her 25 minutes played.Of most concern for Georgia was its season-high 27 turnovers, amounting to 25 points for Georgia Tech. Georgia was able to out-rebound Georgia Tech 42-33, though, and had 17 points off the bench.The Bulldogs now head to Bimini, Bahamas, to play Minnesota in the opening game of the 2016 Junkanoo Jam on Thursday.","Layne Saliba

1-Dec-16,Georgia football gains verbal commitments from two 4-star recruits,"Georgia football received two verbal commitments from two four-star recruits today in the form of wide receiver Jeremiah Holloman and defensive end Malik Herring.The duo committed to the Bulldogs with a Christmas-themed video in which fellow Georgia commits Jake Fromm and Richard LeCounte III acted as Santa delivering a present. The present was their commitment to Georgia. The video was posted to DawgNation.com. “I want to play for championships,” both players said in the commitment video. “I want to be a part of something greater than myself. I want to be on a great team. That’s not all. I want to play with savages.”


 


Holloman gives Georgia four commitments at wide receiver. As the No. 19 overall wide receiver, Holloman is the highest ranked of the four. A look at the 6-foot-2 receiver’s highlight tape shows reliable hands, speed to stretch the defense and impressive athleticism. The Newton product stayed inside the state of Georgia over offers from LSU, Auburn, Tennessee, Nebraska and Miami.Herring, meanwhile, committed to the Bulldogs over Clemson and Alabama. His 6-foot-3, 265-pound frame gives Georgia something Kirby Smart has said it has little of — a defensive lineman with speed and intermediate size. Herring is the rated as the No. 4 defensive end in the class. Holloman and Herring’s commitments give Georgia 18 commitments in the class of 2017. Its national ranking now sits at No. 3 behind Alabama and Ohio State, respectively. Georgia Boys staying home!!

The Bulldogs will begin the second half of its season with a 4-3 record and a 1-2 record against Southeastern Conference teams.“We had a strong and very competitive fall semester,” head coach Meghan Boenig said. “We learned a lot of valuable lessons and put a lot of good things into place.”Georgia went 3-0 at home, which moved the team's all-time home record to 61-6. Two of those three wins came against ranked opponents. 


 


The riders earned a total of 15 Most Outstanding Performer (MOP) honors this fall season.Senior Meg O’Mara was honored as the SEC and NCEA Rider of the Month in October for equitation over fences. O’Mara had a 7-0 record in equitation on the flat and a 6-1 record in equitation over fences throughout the first half of the season.Freshmen Maddy Darst and Sydney Hutchins participated in their first collegiate meet against South Carolina. Both riders competed in equitation over fences and equitation on the flat. Anna Hutlas, a sophomore, obtained a spot in the horsemanship lineup to start the season while competing in six total meets. Juniors Meghan Flanagan Payton Anderson made their first and only career appearances in the lineup so far. After seven meets this fall, the Bulldogs will compete in six regular season meets over the spring season before SEC Championships in March and NCEA National Championship in April. “We’re still hungry,” Boenig said. “Don’t underestimate the quality and the work that these girls are putting in. Everyday they come out and impress.”",Nikki Weldon @bonechip,sports,https://www.redandblack.com/sports/looking-back-at-georgia-equestrian-s-fall-portion-of-the/article_7a661784-b8d8-11e6-9fbe-ef14f3e545c1.html

It was difficult for Sullins to get bars on board in the beginning, but since the event has grown over the years, bars now beg to be a stop on the crawl.Over the past two years, the pub crawl raised over four thousand dollars for its chosen non-profit, the Athens Area Humane Society. The society was chosen to be the dedicated non-profit of the crawl again this year.Proceeds from the crawl fund the humane society’s efforts to spay and neuter stray animals and then adopt them out into the community, lowering animal euthanasia rates among Athens strays.Not only does the pub crawl raise money for the society through donations, it also raises awareness as the sight of a costumed crowd tends to provoke bystanders to ask questions and engage with the event.“We stir up a bit of a ruckus and people start to ask why we are doing this,” Sullins said as she described how participants will hand out flyers and talk about the humane society with onlookers on the night of the crawl.“We try to pick bars that will have people in them, we make sure we go by the busiest areas with our routes to get people to wonder what’s going on,” Sullins said.Walking along with the crawlers, a vendor will sell Santa Claus hats on a stick along with wristbands so that any interested bystanders can easily join the crowd at any point in the crawl.“We’ve had some weird reactions but the coolest reactions are the people who jump in with us,” Sullins said. “It’s been neat to see how many people are willing to join the event right there and then.”


 


The bars chosen for this season’s crawl are Boar’s Head Lounge, Cutters Pub, Iron Factory, The Max Canada and Live Wire Athens.Each bar will prepare a special drink for the crawlers and offer discounts for those with wristbands. Most have donated gift cards to be given as prizes during a raffle and costume contest at the end of the night.When the crowd reaches Live Wire Athens, ten of the best dressed crawlers will be chosen to enter the costume contest.From there, the crawlers get to decide on three winners by donating change in buckets associated with each participant.Live Wire is donating its venue and providing music by DJ Osmose free of charge so the crawlers can celebrate a night spent partying in benefit of the local community through support of the Athens Area Humane Society.  The Athens Annual Santa Pub Crawl will happen on the night of Dec. 3, starting at Boar’s Head Lounge. The experience will last from 5:30 p.m. to 11 p.m. and span five bars. Wristbands are $15 in advance and $20 at the door.",Nicole Schlabach @nicoleschakalaka,culture,https://www.redandblack.com/culture/holiday-bar-crawl-will-save-athens-strays-from-euthanasia/article_3b2f9294-b8be-11e6-8831-f3e37de69637.html
2-Dec-16,Keppner Boxing trains Parkinson's patients,"When Muhammad Ali was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease in 1984, he and the sport of boxing became the vehicle through which awareness of the illness was spread at a greater rate than ever before. More than 30 years later in Athens, boxing continues to help those suffering from the debilitating condition.Keppner Boxing is a gym located just two miles down Baxter Street coming from the University of Georgia campus. Owners Keith Keppner and his wife, Lissa, train boxers of all ages and skill levels, ranging from children to professionals. But the most unique class they offer is the one that meets on Tuesday mornings. It's an hour long class, and it's made up entirely of Parkinson's patients.According to Keppner, the high-intensity cardio exercise that boxing provides is one of the best ways for someone suffering from Parkinson's disease to deal with his or her situation. The commonly known Parkinson's symptoms such as tremors and loss of motor control are caused by a lack of dopamine, and the cardio workouts Keppner's trainees go through increases the absorption of dopamine in their brains.


 


And while the physiological benefit boxing provides is significant, Keppner said its psychological purpose can be just as important.""It gives them a good outlet, something exciting and fun to do,"" he said. ""It's definitely been shown to slow the onset of the illness.""If there's anyone who knows what kind of mental impact boxing can have on someone trying to deal with a life-changing illness, it's Keppner.When he was 17 years old, he was diagnosed with lyme disease, which put him in extreme joint pain and had him bedridden for 15 hours a day. His father was a boxing trainer, so it was natural for him to use it as a method to turn around his health.""Boxing was a way for me to motivate me and encourage me,"" Keppner said. ""It gave me a system to get my life together.""Keppner's arduous recovery is perhaps what provided him with what trainee Megan Bredahl considers his most important quality as a trainer.""He's so patient with us,"" Bredahl said. ""He pushes us right up to the limit, but he doesn't push us over.""Having come back from a disease that had him at less than 100 percent, Keppner recognizes the importance of knowing one's own limits in the gym. An overly intense workout can cause more harm than good in an individual dealing with serious health issues.


 


But based on Keppner's experience since starting his class, the benefits boxing can have for Parkinson's patients greatly outweigh the risks. And while there is no evidence of a cure or method to reverse the effects of the disease, he has seen an exceptional rate of success in the improvement of his afflicted trainees.""One of the gentleman came in here initially, and he could barely walk,"" Keppner said. ""Now, he's getting punches down, and he's a lot more coordinated. His son said he's walking more easily. It's amazing to see that change.""He also said transformations like this are an almost common occurrence, and he can see the difference boxing makes in people's lives in nearly every class he has.And with each day of improvement, Keppner's pupils who are battling Parkinson's continue to prove one thing: whether you're Muhammad Ali or someone who boxes for just an hour on Tuesdays, anyone can be a fighter.","Nathan Berg

6-Dec-16,Indie South Fair-goers explain loyalties to local fair,"Indie South Fair took place this weekend, and The Red and Black interviewed vendors and customers alike to find out what made this weekend’s local fair the best around.“I think that it’s a really good way to bring a lot of people from different areas in the South together— we’re walking around and talking to people from Nashville and also locals! I think that this a great opportunity that we wouldn’t get to see if none of this existed,” said Julia Connell, a human geography major from Duluth, Ga.Both she and Liam Polk have attended Indie South Fair before, and admire the fair for its ability to showcase a wide selection of handcrafted goods.


 


“I really need a Christmas present for my dad. He hates everything, so I figured I would come here for something he’d like,” said Polk, an English masters student from Alpharetta,Ga.Callee Manna, a third-year student from Rome, owns the shop “Calista Blue”, which sells sustainably-made jewelry inspired by her ecology major.“My favorite part about Indie South Fair is that I get to meet other vendors and meet the people that buy my jewelry. Indie South Fair does a great job of promoting its vendors, and they’re super organized. I’ve been to other fairs, but Indie is different because it’s more of a younger crowd with up-and-coming artists and people trying to start their own businesses. It makes me super excited because there are other people like me here that are trying to start websites and businesses.” You can find her work here.Kelly Sweitzer, an artist from Wilmington, N.C., owns The Pepper Mill Shop, which sells a wide variety of items like bags and t-shirts that are printed with illustrated food puns.“What’s different about Indie South Fair from other festivals is the indie part of it— the talent here is amazing, and every vendor here looks so proud of what they’ve done. It’s my first time here, and I’m really excited to be apart of this.” You can find her shop here.David Boardman owns the business Boardman Co. Woodworks, which is located in Jefferson, Ga., and specializes in custom handmade wood furniture and home decor. “This is only my third festival, and today has been better than the other two combined— it’s been packed. The people are so much better here than the other two as well. It’s fun talking to people; I’m the type that even when I had a real job, I would always get in trouble for talking to people too much, and it works out that now I can talk to all the vendors and customers and not get in trouble.” You can find his shop here.George Stankus owns the business Lamped Lighting, which turns junk found in recycling bins and thrift stores into lamps that also function as unique and creative pieces of art.


 


 “I’ve been with the Indie South Fair for probably about two and a half years. Wherever it goes, I usually go. When you come to this, you know that you’re going to find quality stuff. My favorite part of doing the fair is that most of the vendors here have turned into friends. We all help each other— if you have to leave or you’re busy, someone will always be there to watch your booth for you.” You can find his work here.",Ellie Cash @redandblack,culture,https://www.redandblack.com/culture/indie-south-fair-goers-explain-loyalties-to-local-fair/article_b76c8690-bbda-11e6-9ec8-db21901cf738.html
7-Dec-16,SGA administration hit the ground running,"Since April’s election, the new Student Government Association administration at the University of Georgia has passed more than a dozen resolutions, several bills and made major changes to university policy.In his letter to the student body, SGA president Houston Gaines applauded the administration for having “accomplished more than a few record-breaking achievements at the University of Georgia.”However, following inauguration of the Commit ticket, SGA’s Senate found itself lacking representation for nine colleges. 


 


Despite the rocky start, Gaines believes SGA has been highly successful thus far. He said he is proud of the work that’s been done and is confident moving forward.“It’s just been really neat to see so many things come to fruition,” he said. “We ran on a platform, and I’d suggest we accomplished most everything on that platform already.” While he feels he and his running mates have fulfilled the promises they ran on, Gaines also maintains that some of their greatest success has been with a challenge they never expected.“Other issues have come up from students telling us that they see an issue on campus, and we’ve been able to address so many things, and we’ve gone way beyond our platform,” he said. “We have accomplished that and — I would argue — more than doubled that.”One achievement SGA is particularly proud of was this year’s early voting in the Tate Student Center, a first for the university, which Gaines said included a lot of work, and was something many thought to be impossible.“Ultimately [we were] approved by the Board of Elections after being told by a lot of people we’ve tried this before, and it’s not going to happen,” Gaines said. “We worked our tail off to make sure it did happen.”In the two days of voting, 2,648 students voted early on campus for the first time in the history of the university.While Gaines sees early voting as a big step for campus, he said SGA’s biggest accomplishment in office was their first – the update of the amnesty policy to protect overdosed students.


 


On July 1, the university enacted a change to its Responsible Action Protocol, which extends amnesty to students who overdose on alcohol or drugs.The university policy already offered amnesty to “anyone who reports a drug or alcohol-related overdose to medical and law enforcement officials.” The new policy granted it to the students who overdose as well.Another university policy victory included SGA succeeding to increase the transparency of student fees, while at the same time making a reduction in overall fees. “We strongly feel that student fees should go down,” Gaines said. “[A $2 fee], while it’s small, is a step in the right direction.”Academic issues have been another emphasis of SGA policy this year. SGA played a role in pushing back the start date for Fall 2017 and hosted a series of roundtables throughout the semester to improve late night transportation, advocate for mental health awareness, and the implementation of the Destination Dawgs program, which offers students with intellectual disabilities the opportunity to study at UGA.SGA also helped rewrite the football ticket policies so that each student is allowed two strikes instead of three, and direct donations no longer exist. This change was initially conerning for some students, but every student who requested a home ticket package this season was granted one.“I don’t think freshmen know enough about the strikes before they get the tickets. It can get pretty severe pretty quickly without them knowing about it,” said Madeleine Lyons, a freshman animal science major from Peachtree City.Despite pushbacks, Gaines is confident SGA will continue to advocate for the student body.

25-Dec-16,Georgia receives Christmas Day recruiting commitment,"In addition to the presents unwrapped on Christmas Day, Georgia received a Christmas present in the form of Nate McBride.McBride, the No. 2 inside linebacker in the country for the class of 2017, committed to the Bulldogs on Christmas Day in a video produced by SEC Country.


 


The four-star rated McBride particularly stands out due to his blend of size and speed. He stands at 6-foot-2 and 220 pounds. He also runs the 40-yard dash in 4.43 seconds and the 100 meters in 10.5 seconds, according to McBride’s Hudl profile. At the 2015 NFL Combine, Darron Lee ran the 40-yard dash in 4.47 seconds. He was later drafted in the first round by the New York Jets.“It was close but the Bulldogs rallied,” McBride said in the video. “Everyone came through and supported what I felt all along.“I’ve always wanted to play for a great team, and I’ve always wanted to commit to the 'G'.”McBride picked the in-state Bulldogs over Auburn, Oregon and Alabama. He will play in the Army All-American game on Jan. 7.Georgia now has 20 commits and the No. 3 class in the country with National Signing Day approaching soon on Feb. 1.At the end of the video, McBride asks Georgia commits Richard LeCounte III and Jake Fromm, “So where are we going next?”“Richie, is it time to get you-know-who?” Fromm said.“Yes sir, I know just where to go next,” LeCounte said.


 


After McBride released his decision, defensive line commit Malik Herring tweeted the class isn’t finished coming together. If that’s the case, a lot more could be in store for the Bulldogs.All rankings and information obtained from 247Sports.com, unless otherwise noted.","Wilson Alexander

1-Jan-17,Georgia women's basketball drops first game of SEC play,"In its first conference game on the first day of the new year, Georgia’s second-half offensive struggles continued as Missouri notched the first Southeastern Conference win of 2017, beating the Bulldogs 63-45. The third quarter was rough for Georgia as the team only produced six points, while the Tigers managed 18, taking a 51-35 lead into the final quarter. “We had a really bad third quarter and I thought we just looked foggy,” head coach Joni Taylor said. “To win in the SEC on the road, we have to play better than that every quarter.”


 


A 10-0 run by Georgia in the fourth showed a small glimmer of hope for the Bulldogs as the team cut the Tigers lead to a nine-point differential, but Missouri answered with an 8-0 run of its own to finish out the game. Missouri’s Sierra Michaelis and Cierra Porter led the way offensively for the Tigers, as both posted a 20-point game.And as Missouri had multiple athletes scoring double digits, Pachis Roberts was the lone double-figure scorer on the Georgia roster, finishing the game with 16 points.Roberts came out in the opening quarter scoring the first seven points of the game for the Bulldogs. Keeping Georgia in the game, a breakaway layup by Roberts gave Georgia a 24-23 lead with a little over four minutes left before halftime. Missouri headed into the locker room with a 33-29 lead, with Georgia not far behind thanks to Roberts’ 11-point first half. Coming out of halftime, Georgia’s outside shooting went cold as the Bulldogs did not hit its first shot of the third quarter until 2:33 remained. By that time, Missouri’s Michaelis had recorded 12 of her 20 points of the game, giving the Tigers the lead it needed to ride out the victory. Georgia, now 8-6 overall and 0-1 in conference play, heads back to Athens to host two SEC games this week, with Texas A&M on Thursday and Vanderbilt on Sunday.",Tori McElhaney @tori_mcelhaney,sports,https://www.redandblack.com/sports/georgia-women-s-basketball-drops-first-game-of-sec-play/article_925f28fc-d067-11e6-80ca-0bcaf08a91e0.html

3-Jan-17,"Hip Vintage and Handmade opens with large selection, unconventional location","Hip Vintage and Handmade, a new store in Athens, has recently opened its doors to shoppers and vendors alike. Offering a space to sell and plenty to buy, the owners of Hip Vintage and Handmade hope to bring business back into an overlooked part of the city. Going into the store is a unique experience, as store owners John and Leslie Lawson have returned to Athens after creating and teaching art on three different continents. As self proclaimed hippies, the pair hopes to breathe life back into the outskirts of Athens, located at 215 Commerce Blvd. “Any time people talk about Athens, you hear about downtown and Normaltown, but there’s a lot happening outside of that,” said store co-owner Leslie Lawson. “We hope that our store will help people explore this part of town There’s a lot here left to see.”


 


The store offers space to more than 100 vendors, allowing people to rent out sections of the store to sell their own items. Vendors can sell whatever they like in whatever amount of space they prefer. While most of the merchandise is handmade or vintage, they also carry vinyl through Athens-based Secret Sounds.""Any time people talk about Athens, you hear about downtown and Normaltown, but there’s a lot happening outside of that.""– Leslie Lawson“I’ve been doing this since 1975, since I opened Chapter Three Records on Broad Street downtown,” said Chris Rasmussen, owner of Secret Sounds. “I’m the only vinyl vendor here.”From jewelry to furniture to records, Hip Vintage and Handmade offers a large enough selection of products for the owners to stop there— but they didn’t. The shop also offers art and homesteading classes taught by the owners themselves. “John and I met in art school in Holland, and we both continued to teach art after that,” Lawson said. “We’ve lived really interesting lives.”


 


The couple hopes to bring a mix of all of the places they’ve lived to Athens, while still appreciating the originality of the city. As many do, Leslie Lawson returned to Athens after decades apart, initially leaving after graduating from the University of Georgia.“Athens is edgy but fun, conservative but never stifling,” Lawson said. “It’s the most comfortable place I’ve ever lived. I love it.”",Rosemary Scott @scott_maryrose,culture,https://www.redandblack.com/culture/hip-vintage-and-handmade-opens-with-large-selection-unconventional-location/article_ba8d8860-d129-11e6-b4b0-d79475a99a8b.html
5-Jan-17,OPINION: How journalists can regain public trust in 2017,"As with any election, the 2016 presidential election revealed trends, thoughts and facts across our country that we did not even know to speculate about. Among those revelations was a trend that reared its troublesome head loudly: public trust in the media is low and continues to fall.According to Gallup, public trust in the media has been sinking below a normal level since 2007. In particular, 2016 marked the lowest level of trust in the media for Republicans in 20 years. Fourteen percent of respondents said they trusted the media’s reports.This level of distrust, the sources of which are still being debated in policy think tanks and newsrooms, has driven many Americans to fringe news sources, often containing inaccuracies and using unsavory methods.


 


Some are conspiracy theorists turned Internet stars, such as Alex Jones’ Infowars; others are created by entrepreneurial youth in Macedonia, as the Associated Press found in early December. Regardless of the source, fake Internet news has emerged as something unlikely to major media: a competitor for the public’s attention.Much of that fake news was disseminated across social media, and Facebook, a firestorm of discussion for its newsfeed algorithm, has teamed up with organizations such as Snopes, the AP and Factcheck.org to monitor and fact check stories that circulate through its network.However, fake news was but one of many symptoms of problems the American media now faces. President-elect Donald Trump ran on an anti-establishment ideology, which hit a nerve with many Americans across the country as seen in his unexpected victory.

Journalism was labeled as one of the those establishments, and the president-elect has been combative and guarded with much of the media through his campaign and before his inauguration. That trend will most likely persist into the administration.Journalism now has a strange, contradictory role to play for the public. Reporters and writers have much to investigate and be aware of in 2017, but they also must win back the public’s trust in a time where many Americans have a distaste for anything that looks like the establishment.Somewhere in this election is a future thesis paper: social media newsfeeds influencing news consumption, fake news providing an outlet for blatant bias and falsities and a general sense of suspicion and even disdain for American institutions.However, that same Gallup poll that reported a historic drop in trust also noted another observation: 1972 was America’s highest level of trust in the media at 72 percent. 1972 saw journalists investigating Watergate, Richard Nixon and the Vietnam War 1972, offering Americans in-depth reporting and stories that influenced public perception.


 


The American people have as much to think about in 2017 as they did in 1972. With that in mind, if the media can offer powerful investigation and thoughtful reporting to the public, perhaps it can restore the public’s faith in this one institution.","Joe Youorski

8-Jan-17,"Last-second shot by Stephanie Paul lifts Georgia over Vanderbilt, 70-68","With the game tied at 68-68 with less than four seconds remaining on the clock, Georgia senior Shanea Armbrister had the ball right outside the paint.Armbrister was the leading scorer for the Bulldogs (10-6) in their Sunday match up against Vanderbilt (10-6), finishing the game with 18. Everyone thought she would take the last shot, and she was comfortable with that.Until she saw another white jersey make a clean cut towards the basket.


 


“I was a little nervous to be honest,” Armbrister said about the last few seconds. “I was okay with taking the shot, but I saw Stephanie [Paul] cut and with her size and the way she pivots, I knew she was going to get fouled or make the shot.”And after a turn-around jumper, Paul got the shot off with .3 seconds to spare and ultimately sealed Georgia’s second Southeastern Conference victory, 70-68.“I just tried to cut to an open space,” Paul said. “Thank God I was open.”The freshman post finished the game with 12 points and seven rebounds, a small glimpse into what head coach Joni Taylor expects to see from Paul throughout her time at Georgia.“She has no fear,” Taylor said of Paul. “She had no idea that was the game winning shot, she was just out there making a play. She is someone who is continuing to evolve; I think that this is just a peek of what you are going to see from Stephanie throughout the course of her career.”After arguably its best offensive game against Texas A&M on Jan. 5, Georgia struggled to find its shot early on, only shooting 33% from the field in the first. Vanderbilt, on the other hand, connected with 5 threes to take a 21-10 lead in the opening quarter.“We had to make the shooter put the ball on the floor,” Armbrister said. “They knocked down a lot of wide open shots [in the first quarter] and we just had to make them start running their plays.”


 


A 7-0 run by the Bulldogs midway through the second quarter cut Vanderbilt’s lead to 29-23 with 4:10 remaining.Nine points from Armbrister in the closing minutes of the second quarter got the Bulldogs within one as the Commodores took a 33-32 lead into halftime.Following a 22-point second quarter, Georgia continued its shooting success into the third. A few shots in the paint from Paul gave Georgia its first lead of the game at 47-40 with 4:27 remaining before the fourth.  Vanderbilt didn’t go quietly though, as the Commodores hit a couple 3-pointers to come within four points at the start of the fourth, down only 59-55.With 6:38 remaining in the game, Georgia’s Caliya Robinson, Haley Clark, and Halle Washington picked up their fourth foul each, allowing Vanderbilt to tie things up at 62-62.At the two-minute mark Vanderbilt took the 68-65 lead before Georgia’s Pachis Roberts laid the ball in for two, getting fouled in the process. After making her free throw, it was tied 68-68 with less than a minute remaining in the game.But a heads-up play by Armbrister as the seconds wound down gave Paul the shot and Georgia the win.“We were just trying to get the last shot,” Paul said. “Luckily, we were able to.”

15-Jan-17,Longest running event on university's campus centered around coffee,"The department of International Student life held their International Student Coffee Hour at Memorial Hall Friday, something which they do every Friday and have done for the past four decades.Justin Jeffery, director of International Student Life considers this event is an important way to showcase culture to the campus.""Its the longest running event on campus. It has been running for 42 plus years,"" Jeffery said. "" A small group of international students created the event as a way to come together weekly and celebrate culture and be together. Every Friday for the last 42 years it has been happening.""


 


Every week a different organization organizes the event to showcase their culture through avenues such as food and performance. The Brazilian Student Association organized this week's coffee hour. They featured their local Brazilian dishes and drinks for attendees to try.Lunara Goncalves, president of the Brazilian Student Association said the event is not only important for international students but also local students.""I think it is important because we can meet people from different countries, share our culture and learn about each other,"" Goncalves said. ""We have people involved, not just the Brazilians but the students from the Portuguese program help us to prepare activities. We are a group but not just a group of Brazilians. We are a group of UGA students.""Bridget Thompson, a junior from Grayson studying microbiology and Spanish said she was happy to be able to attend on Friday being that she usually has class during the coffee hours, which go from 11:30 a.m. to 1 p.m.""I am excited to learn about a different culture than mine. It is important because it helps to bring unity in the community,"" Thompson said. ""We all have different identities. We all come from different cultural backgrounds and it is important for us to be unified even though we come from those different cultures.""Suman Barat, a junior from India studying biology and women's studies said that she has been a world ambassador for the department of International Student Life since her freshman year.""I moved here from India and I love working with international students because I come from that background,"" Barat said.

15-Jan-17,Arts center holds exhibition in honor of MLK,"In anticipation for Martin Luther King, Jr. Day, the Lyndon House Arts Center hosted a celebration in honor of Martin Luther King Jr. Saturday.From 1 to 2 p.m., the 10th annual ""Visions of MLK"" began with a gallery talk with Juan Logan, award winning African American artist. His artwork highlights personal experiences that can be felt by his audience.“I try not to provide people with a lot of answers. I’m trying to raise questions, you see,” Logan said. “[Artwork] provided me with a voice… a space where I can not only experience those things, talk through those things… but to put them out to the world for other people to engage in.”


 


Logan presented three of his pieces, which run for $6,000 or more, at the exhibit and gallery talk. One piece is titled “I’ll Save You Tomorrow,” and in it, a boat is upside down. “It didn’t pick up anybody,” Logan said. “For many of those who perished, we watched and did nothing.”The piece’s theme enhances the theme of the event: ""Let us build bridges,"" in honor of what Martin Luther King, Jr. once said, “Let us build bridges rather than barriers…”Organizer of the event William Montu Miller based the theme of the afternoon off of this quote.“MLK said let us build bridges not walls. To me, in this day in time we’re living in now… we really need to build more bridges,"" Miller said.To build a bridge is symbolic of making connections with other people, blurring the gap between different groups of people.For Miller, that means getting outside of his comfort zone. He does so by going to Mosque with a Muslim individual or by going to dinner with someone he normally wouldn’t go to dinner with.“You can build a bridge, but it’s no good if you don’t use it,” Miller said.


 


From 2 to 4 p.m., the entertainment portion began, kicking off with Eric Johnson, the music director singing the Black National Anthem.The performers, which included dancers, singers and poets, incorporated this theme in their dances, songs and poems.Eric Thönnesen, writer and poet, presented a spoken word that encouraged the theme of the afternoon.“Healing comes with an open hand lifted above, offered to another man,” Thönnesen said in his piece.Another performer, author and poet Shedrick Barnett, performed an inspiring poem. “Knock down walls of fear… let us come together and build bridges of hands,” Barnett said in his poem.The audience was actively engaged with the performers by singing along and cheering on.The performances were not exclusive to singers and poets. There were also a number of dancers, who expressed feelings of oppression and battle, inspiration and courage, as well as step team groups and a motivational speaker.Although the celebration was largely entertaining, it’s purpose extended deeper than that.

During the entire event, there was a children’s activity in which kids wrote down on a piece of paper what they would do for other people. The paper would then be attached to a hand-built bridge.“We’re hoping to promote peace and love and a spirit of working together and service to others,” William Stephanos, the museum’s arts education specialist said.","Ashley Soriano

15-Jan-17,Georgia women's basketball loses second straight conference game,"The Georgia women’s basketball team got behind early and was unable to come back as Kentucky beat the Bulldogs 82-61 for the fifth time in seven tries on Sunday at Memorial Coliseum in Lexington, Kentucky.“Getting off to a good start and being on the road, we just haven't figured out how to come out and throw the first punch,” head coach Joni Taylor said.Redshirt senior guard Pachis Roberts led the Bulldogs (10-8, 2-3) with 20 points and six rebounds, while junior guard Shanea Armbrister added 13 points and five rebounds. Junior guard Simone Costa added 10 points to Georgia’s total as well.

16-Jan-17,How former Georgia players fared in the NFL this weekend,"A quiet SaturdayWith only eight teams out of 32 still alive for the divisional round of the NFL playoffs, the number of former Georgia players to watch has dropped as well.Only nine Bulldogs remained in contention with only seven of them seeing the field. 


 


Saturday featured an afternoon game with the Seahawks falling to the Falcons 36-20 at the Georgia Dome. Not a single former Georgia player saw the field in this game after Seahawks defensive tackle John Jenkins was declared inactive. In the nightcap match-up of Texans-Patriots, safety Corey Moore led the Texans defense with a game-high 8 tackles. It wasn’t enough for Houston to leave New England with a win, however, as former Georgia center David Andrews and wide receiver Malcolm Mitchell advanced to the AFC Championship.Conley takes big hit In what was perhaps the scariest moment of the weekend, wide receiver Chris Conley took a shot over the middle of the field after laying out for a pass from Chiefs quarterback Alex Smith. As bad as it looked, Conley only missed one play, and the hit he took resulted in a first down for the Chiefs on a crucial third down. The North Paulding graduate finished the game with 2 receptions for 19 yards. Wilson and Houston combine for 20+ tacklesAlthough Kansas City fell to Pittsburgh 18-16, the Chiefs defense did its part keeping Ben Roethlisberger and the dynamic Steelers offense from finding the end zone. All 18 of Pittsburgh’s points came off of field goals. This defensive performance was spearheaded by two Bulldogs in linebackers Ramik Wilson and Justin Houston. Wilson led the game with 15 tackles, including 1.5 behind the line of scrimmage.


 


Houston tallied six of his own tackles, as the two former Georgia defenders combined for over 20 tackles on the night.What’s nextMoving on to the conference championships, there are three Bulldogs whose teams will still be playing, as Jarvis Jones and the Steelers will take on Andrews, Mitchell, and the Patriots for a chance to play in the Super Bowl.","Zach Shugan

17-Jan-17,"Transfer students talk struggle, adjustment, opportunities","Although his experience has been slightly different from most other UGA students, Ryan Austin shares a typical bulldog love for his school.“I’d always wanted to go to UGA but I never thought it’d be possible,” Austin said.Austin may be at the school he’s always wanted to attend now, but he had to switch allegiances first. Similar to about 5 percent of the student body, Austin is a transfer student from Georgia College, arriving this semester with a year and a half of college under his belt.


 


“I wanted something bigger. The actual college experience,” Austin said. In some ways, “something bigger” has proven to be a challenge.“You know when you first got here as a freshman, it was very overwhelming and very different from high school? It feels like that only more so,” Austin said. “It’s not only different from high school, it’s different from the college I transferred from.”Rebecca Mackelprang, who transferred from Utah State University in fall of 2016, has faced some similar challenges while navigating a new school and new classes.“The campus is humongous compared to the walkable campus I went to before,” Mackelprang said. “The classes are a lot harder. Don’t go in thinking you’re going to get easy As like you did at your old school.”""The classes are a lot harder. Don’t go in thinking you’re going to get easy As like you did at your old school.”– Rebecca Mackelprang


 


According to transfer students, though UGA may be overwhelming at first, it proves its value through extensive resources that are available to students. Austin said he believes his previous professors wanted him to succeed, however he was not given the opportunities he needed to do so.“Here they have the resources,” Austin said. “We have learning centers, we have tutors, we have TAs… That’s going to be very beneficial to me.”Austin said he’s looking forward to learning more about opportunities at UGA during the years ahead of him on campus.“I worked in Milledgeville for the entire summer, and I realized I didn’t want to be there for the next three years of my life,” he said. “I don’t really know what’s here, but I’m interested.”1,293New transfer students enrolled at UGA for the fall 2015 semester (Source: UGA FactBook)

Mackelprang confessed that it’s been difficult acclimating to UGA, but she’s benefitted from the accommodations granted by UGA’s Disability Resource Center and the extracurricular opportunities that have brought her new friendships.“Definitely get involved with a lot of extracurricular activities,” Mackelprang advised new transfer students. “It helps to make friends and grow those bonds that you missed out on not being a freshman at UGA.”Samuel Peraza, a senior who transferred to UGA after earning his Associate Degree from Abraham Baldwin Agricultural College, now serves as a UGA ambassador of the Arch Society, where he is practically an extension of the university itself. Peraza had his own advice to offer transfer students.“Do your research on what UGA has to offer,” Peraza said. “Secondly, dive in. Don’t be afraid. Get out there. Make friends. Join clubs … be successful and happy.”",Laurel Hiatt @laurel_hiatt,culture,https://www.redandblack.com/culture/transfer-students-talk-struggle-adjustment-opportunities/article_96ded274-dc38-11e6-ae0e-0be8f00ddc61.html
18-Jan-17,"Jittery Joe's Head Roaster talks bikes, beans, travel","When one thinks about Jittery Joe’s Coffee, what first comes to mind are coffee shops and massive amounts of whole bean sales. However, the people behind the chain, arguably the most important part, are often overlooked.Charlie Mustard, Jittery Joe’s Head Roaster, is one of those people. After meeting him, it’s difficult to think of the coffee chain as anything other than a business built from the ground up by people who had a dream of working with coffee.Mustard has been roasting coffee for the majority of the 22 years that Jittery Joe’s has been open. As head roaster, he works daily to roast beans that are sent all over the world.


 


Even though Mustard is well-known in the local community, he did not grow up in Athens. He was raised in Columbia, South Carolina and attended Clemson University. It wasn’t until 1990 that Mustard moved to Athens to pursue a Master’s of Nutrition at UGA.“I love Athens,” Mustard said. “I fully appreciate how unique of a community it is.”While working towards his degree at UGA, Mustard befriended the founders of Jittery Joe’s. He learned they had been buying coffee from a distributor in Atlanta until the proposal of roasting in Athens popped up. Mustard went to the UGA library to read up on the coffee roasting process and realized he could do it himself.“I told them I would roast the beans for them, in exchange for all the free coffee I could drink,” Mustard said.Almost all operations are performed by hand by Mustard and his peers at the roastery. From canning and packaging coffee beans to roasting and mixing the coffee to creating different blends, Mustard and his peers take pride in their work.“I feel that we, as humans, are always looking for the easiest way to do something. We want to decrease the effort put forth,” Mustard said.“I feel that putting forth the effort allows us to gain benefit in the long run. I would much rather keep picking up bags of coffee than have a machine do it for me. Yes, a bag of coffee is heavy, but when I stop picking them up, I won't be able to pick them up anymore.”“Everything at the Jittery Joe's roastery is done by hand ... roasting, packing, shipping,” Mustard said. “I love all of the people I work with. They teach me so much about life. So much better than a machine, plus we give jobs to many people, instead of just a few.”


 


""I love all of the people I work with. They teach me so much about life. So much better than a machine, plus we give jobs to many people, instead of just a few.”– Charlie MustardCorwin Weik, an active member of the skateboarding and coffee community in Athens, has worked alongside Mustard since he began working at the roastery.“Being around Charlie is incredibly motivating,” Weik said. “It’s like working with a superhero. He’s got a young spirit, and he is a piece of muscle.” Though the primary purpose of the roastery is to roast and package the beans, the coffee also has to be delivered to local restaurants such as Mama’s Boy and The Grit. To do this, employees choose to bike—there are multiple bikes on site made available to the workers.This is in part due to Mustard. Though his primary passion is coffee, he is also interested in bikes, participating in a bike commute to Savannah each year.“The bike is the answer!” Mustard said. “A bike is freedom—freedom to travel and explore when you are a kid, a ship to different worlds.  It is the answer to so many problems faced by adults, if you let it be—financial, health, societal, ecological and on and on....The bike is one of the most efficient machines man has ever invented. If you ride one, you are one of the sexiest people around.”

Though the majority of what Mustard drinks is from Jittery Joe’s, he appreciates quality coffee no matter where it’s made. He spends time at local coffee houses regularly, while also trying coffee from around the world when it’s brought to him or when he travels himself.“I go over to 1000 Faces regularly to get a shot of espresso since they’re right across from us, and I go to Two Story if I’m in the neighborhood,” Mustard said. “One of the things I like doing is trading people that travel regularly coffee to bring back other coffees from around the country and world. We have gotten to try some pretty neat coffees that way.”Whether he’s at the roastery, biking through town or supporting other local coffee shops, Mustard makes sure that he’s making a positive impact on Athens. Everyone knows that Athens isn’t Athens without Jittery Joe’s, but only a privileged few know that Jittery Joe’s isn’t Jittery Joe’s without Charlie Mustard.",Hunter Pinkston @redandblack,culture,https://www.redandblack.com/culture/jittery-joe-s-head-roaster-talks-bikes-beans-travel/article_bfbe50aa-dd93-11e6-bea2-4310ea76003b.html
19-Jan-17,OPINION: Political disruption threatens social contract,"“Disruption” is the new buzzword of business, describing upheaval of ingrained markets.  Market disruption has brought smartphones to our hands, ride-sharing apps to those phones and streaming services to our otherwise traditional TV screens.These disruptions have not come without consequences. Once bustling industries have evaporated along with the jobs they once provided. Firms that used to compete ardently now seek to merge in order to fend off their own extinction.Using disruption as a tool is not a new phenomenon in American politics.  Kennedy’s “New Frontier,” Reagan’s “Morning in America” and Obama’s “Hope and Change” all portrayed our body politic as one in need of reform. The president-elect’s “Make America Great Again” also fed on the desire for political disruption. 


 


But this comes with its own threat of consequences. In trying to upend a body politic that may deserve reform, we must not enable the breach of the social contract we have made. The president-elect’s statements and actions indicate a disconcerting ease with the violation of rules in pursuit of promised disruption.He has tweeted his idea of jailing citizens for legal acts of protest. He has questioned the validity of intelligence reports because he does not care for their conclusions. He has likened American intelligence officials, who sacrifice greatly in the name of public service, to “Nazi Germany.” His transition team has made unprecedented requests for personal identification of civil servants working on issues his team does not favor, evoking President Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s post-coup attempt purge of the civil service in Turkey.House Republicans, perhaps inspired by the incoming president, have followed his lead. They have resurrected an arcane budgeting rule that would allow Congress to reduce individual civil servants’ salaries to $1.After the president-elect berated a reporter during his only post-election press conference, a Texas Congressman suggested the reporter should be fired for being “disrespectful” to the president-elect.There can be no doubt that the tools of suppression are being sharpened.The president-elect has basked in his claim that, “I alone can fix it.”  Alexander Hamilton, in making the case for ratification of our Constitution, reminded people that, “of those men who have overturned the liberties of republics, the greatest number have begun their career by paying an obsequious court to the people.”As we observe another American transition of power on Jan. 20, we should remember the heavy price previously paid for such peaceful continuation of our own republican government. Now, our task as citizens is to assure that these many sacrifices were not in vain.


 


We should applaud when the president-elect moves us forward and improves our society, but we should be vigilant in condemning violations of the rules we have set for ourselves and have cherished for generations.  The president-elect deserves the respect due to his office but has earned an unprecedented level of scrutiny. As a prescient Ben Franklin foresaw, vigilance will be required to prevent a succumbing of liberty to authoritarianism — masked as populist disruption.– Submitted by the UGA Law Democrats",UGA Law Democrats,opinion,https://www.redandblack.com/opinion/opinion-political-disruption-threatens-social-contract/article_3210762a-dd07-11e6-8c1d-5f06a6c82671.html
22-Jan-17,UGA Miracle combines competitive eating with competitive running,"Cole Gibbon, a senior computer science major from Marietta couldn’t think of a better way to start a cloudy Sunday morning other than running 3.1 miles, eating 10 doughnuts and puking in the process.“I heard about the race last night at about 10 p.m. when I texted my friend Alden to see if she wanted to go to church,” Gibbon said. “We decided to go to a later service, and I ended up committing to this last minute. It was worth it.”Gibbon “took the dare” of UGA Miracle’s Doughnut Dare 5K, which means he stopped halfway through the race to eat 10 Krispy Kreme doughnuts before continuing to the finish line.


 


Runners could also choice to opt out of the dare and do a “leisure race” instead.“I like food challenges,” Gibbon said. “I like to challenge myself. I’ve run 5Ks before, but I’ve never done it on a stomach full of doughnuts, so I figured why not.”This is the sixth year UGA Miracle has hosted this event, and it’s part of their goal to raise $1 million during the year for Children’s Healthcare of Atlanta.UGA Miracle also started a new partnership with the Aflac Cancer and Blood Disorders Center, so now every dollar raised after the $1 million will go toward this organization.“The partnership is really special to us because we serve about 70 Miracle families with a large ratio of those being cancer patients,” said Caroline Brown, UGA Miracle’s marketing director and senior marketing major from Suwanee.The fundraising year runs from August to February, ending with a 24-hour dance marathon on Feb. 18. Last year, the organization raised their $1 million for the Children’s Healthcare of Atlanta and an additional $68,000, Brown said.Brown said that in the past the Doughnut Dare 5K fundraiser has done really well. The idea for the race started at a university in North Carolina, and UGA Miracle adopted it because it seemed like an interesting challenge.“The core of our organization is tenacity and doing things that are difficult, so we thought we’d take a fun spin on it by adding in the Doughnut Dare,” Brown said.


 


This year, about 400 people registered to run with around 75 to 100 taking the challenge.“A majority of people do not take the dare, mainly because it’s really hard on the body to eat 10 doughnuts in the middle of the race and continue,” Brown said.For the leisure runners, Alex Turnock from Jacksonville, FL, placed first with a time of 17:07. Frederick Stroud from Athens came in second at 18:31.Gibbon said that it wasn’t easy eating 10 doughnuts quickly. He experimented with the fastest way to eat them, finally settling on squishing three doughnuts together and chasing that with water.“It was a solid five seconds of running and vomiting at the same time,” Gibbon said. “I didn’t stop. I had to get that W.”Gibbon finished in 2nd place with a time of 28:26 behind Jacob Noth from Athens, who crossed the finish line at 26:36.Others, like Ryan Sander, senior digital broadcast journalism major from Canton, tried the challenge but couldn’t finish it.Sander is the media co-chair for UGA Miracle and has completed the challenge two other times.


TNCMS.AdManager.render({region: 'fixed-big-ad-bottom-asset', slot: 1, fold: ""below""});


This year, Sander only finished seven doughnuts. He said after the second doughnut, it just gets “worse and worse.”Sander said his strategy is to not think about the doughnuts when running.“The biggest thing is just don’t think about it,” Sander said. “If you start thinking about it too much, the gag reflexes hit. The key is mind over matter.”Brown said even people who didn’t complete the challenge will get 10 doughnuts, all donated by Krispy Kreme Doughnuts.The runners started at Tate, ran up Sanford Drive, went around the journalism building and back down Sanford. They then looped Stegeman Coliseum once, stopped to eat doughnuts, looped Stegeman again and came back up to finish at Tate Student Center.Last year, the race started and ended at Stegeman.“We wanted to streamline it and make it a more centralized location,” Brown said. “Sanford Stadium is in the middle of campus, so we thought it would be great to host it here.”UGA Miracle had water, snacks and boxes of doughnuts waiting for the runners at Tate Student Center Plaza. Music was playing and posters were set up for photo-ops.

Runners could check their time after the race or wait for the results to be posted online. There were some technical difficulties with times 31 to 39 minutes having to be manually recorded, but otherwise the race had no problems, and Brown said the cleanup would only last until 11 a.m.UGA Miracle members, other students and members of the community came out to run this morning, and Brown said that all UGA Miracle events are open to everyone.“We have people from all walks of life,” Brown said. “The oldest registrant we had was 69 or 70, and the youngest we had were 14 year olds and younger running with their parents.”",Erin Schilling | Staff Writer,uganews,https://www.redandblack.com/uganews/uga-miracle-combines-competitive-eating-with-competitive-running/article_8ea716b8-e0cd-11e6-9abf-67446516e087.html

Kyprianou said.Orji had not competed in the triple jump since the 2016 Rio Olympic games, but the absence of competition was not noticed. She captured the national lead in the event, with three jumps over 45 feet, and the winning jump of 45 feet, 9 ¼ inches. Junior Aliyah Johnson, Orji’s training partner, finished third in the event, with jumps over 40 feet as well.“Keturah keeps proving she is an invaluable member of this team and a fierce leader,” Kyprianou said.Fagan tied a school record that senior Tatiana Gusin tied herself two weeks ago. Fagan won the high jump with a career-best 6-foot-2.75 jump. The two training partners now share the record, as well as the national lead in the event.“Mady showed she belongs in the elite group of female high jumpers,” Kyprianou said.


 


Williams took over the No. 2 spot on the national list in the 60 meter hurdles. She broke her own time of 8.09 seconds at last year's NCAA Championships with an 8.07 in the finals.Williams won her second event of the Aggie Invitational in the long jump. She jumped to the No. 2 position on the national list in this event as well, with a jump of 21-feet-4.75 to win by two feet.“Kendell continues to remain humble and continues to progress from where she started,” Kyprianou said.In his Georgia debut after transferring from Florida State and redshirting last season, sophomore Kendal Williams got in the school record books with a time of 6.68 seconds in the 60 meter hurdles. This put him in the No. 7 national spot for the best time this year.Georgia secured a first and second place finish in the weight throw, with Poursanidis throwing a toss good enough for the second best in the nation this year.“I thought Alex surprised himself again with a nice personal best in the weight throw,” said Kyprianou.Sophomore Denzel Comenentia took home the second spot in the weight throw, with a top distance of 65.750 meters. He also won the shot put.The women's team answered the men, with a win in the weight throw as well.

23-Jan-17,UGA professors enforce laptop-free learning,"On the first day of class for the spring semester, many University of Georgia students were likely greeted with a professor or two with a ""no laptop"" policy in their classrooms. This is part of a recent trend of professor's taking the technology out of class.Professors have cited distraction and poor student participation as reasons for the ban.After several years of encouraging technology use in the classroom, journalism professor John Soloski has switched over to a technology-free learning environment last year.


 


Since the switch, Soloski said he has seen overall positive changes in the responses he receives from his students.“Discussion is absolutely the key,” Soloski said. “Without the computers, there’s not this physical barrier between the professor and the students and that’s what makes having a discussion so much easier.”Studies by Princeton University and the University of California at Los Angeles found students who take handwritten notes will generally outperform students who choose to type their notes via computer.This study, discussed in the Wall Street Journal also found students who physically write out class notes typically appear to retain information longer, learn better and have an easier grasp on new ideas related to the subject they are learning.Economics professor Kris McWhite, who also encourages a laptop-free learning environment has found not only is discussion an easier concept to conquer, but distractions are minimized greatly when there are no laptops around during class time.“It’s like you become a court’s stenographer, just writing every word of the slides down,” McWhite said. “But really, it’s the big concepts being discussed that are most important, not the details on the PowerPoint.”Browsing Facebook, playing games and surfing the web are among the many activities McWhite said he has caught his students participating in during class time.It’s nearly impossible to monitor what every student is doing in a 300-student lecture class. It’s even more impossible to ensure students, even the ones who are trying to pay attention, aren’t getting distracted by the video someone is watching three rows ahead of them, McWhite said.


 


“It’s not the idea of you distracting yourself,” McWhite said. “It’s the fact that with a laptop, you are impacting and distracting the other people around you.”While some students understand this initiative of making the classroom as distraction-free as possible, others see the policy as a hindrance.“It’s very inconvenient,” said Amanda Johnson, a junior journalism major. “Some people learn better by using laptops for notes or pulling up links to information that relates to what we are talking about.”Though several may agree with Johnson’s point, a study published in the Journal of Media Education in 2014 reported students spend a fifth of their time in class on their devices doing activities that are unrelated to their school work.To combat this distraction and encourage more student participation in class, professors are looking away from increasing technology use and looking towards encouraging discussion and seminar-style courses.“More and more faculty are coming to understand that equipment can actually get in the way of trying to help students learn,” Soloski said. “It can end up hurting them, in it’s own ironic little way, and we don’t want that.”",Kaley Lefevre | Contributor,uganews,https://www.redandblack.com/uganews/uga-professors-enforce-laptop-free-learning/article_fa65cc08-dff3-11e6-a1d6-6b5b548a9338.html
24-Jan-17,OPINON: Trump adds to the political swamp,"Donald Trump’s promise to “drain the swamp” divided individuals who were skeptical and those who believed Washington would soon hold the values of the American people, not elitists who were just handed cabinet positions. However, under the Trump presidency, it seems the American people might drown in the “swamp” Trump promised to upend.Trump announced his nominee for Secretary of Education as Betsy Devos, a woman whose private school was paid by her wealthy family and who never had to take out loans to provide her children with education.Devos would have the responsibility of issuing Pell Grants and running a one trillion dollar student loan bank if appointed. Senator Elizabeth Warren questioned DeVos’s credibility during a senate confirmation hearing last Tuesday.


 


""The financial futures of an entire generation of young people depends on your department getting that right,"" Warren said. ""Mrs. DeVos, do you have any direct experience running a bank?""DeVos answered no and admitted to having no experience managing loan programs.""Senator, if confirmed I will certainly be very vigilant,"" DeVos said. ""The individuals with whom I worked will ensure that federal monies are used properly and appropriately.”Vigilance must somehow save struggling students and families from enormous education debt and will lead the American people to better education reform. However, DeVos’s history does not paint a bright picture for the future of education.DeVos supported legislation that would charter schools in her home state of Michigan. While her push for privatized education in the state in the early 1990’s was successful, the outcome was not. The state auditor at the time found Michigan had shown “limited effectiveness and efficiency in monitoring” charters, according to a report by Newsweek.DeVos has also been wildly criticized for supporting Christian organizations, and many fear DeVos may blur lines between church and state.She has previously attended annual meetings amongst some of the country’s wealthiest Christians, stating she wants to “advance God’s kingdom” through her work in education, according to a report by Politico.While the American people are certainly getting the change that many petitioned for in Trump, cabinet nominations such as DeVos reveal Trump’s cabinet could include many of the out-of-touch billionaires Trump promised to remove.


 


According to Time, 11 of his 19 cabinet-level appointments have been apart of organizations that have lobbied the government. Collectively, they have spent nearly 500 million to help push their ideals. Other cabinet nominees include friends who helped finance his campaign, such as Steve Mnuchin and Reince Preibus.As the coming days welcome the beginning stages of a new presidency, individuals will have to hope these nominees’ past affiliations do not interfere with rights of all Americans. In terms of education, we should hope to grant access to education to all people, rather than creating competition for struggling schools by pushing for increased private education.Looking at DeVos’s record, however, the American people should worry whether a trust fund baby from Michigan should be at the forefront of the battle for more efficient education in our country.",Cassie Daigle | Staff Writer,opinion,https://www.redandblack.com/opinion/opinon-trump-adds-to-the-political-swamp/article_4261b33c-e0bc-11e6-8c38-b764c62ca223.html

On Jan. 10, high jumper Darius Carbin and freshman Jessica Drop (3000 meters) both took home freshman of the week honors for their respective events. Senior Tatiana Gusin was named the USTFCCCA national women’s athlete of the week and the SEC women’s field athlete of the week for the high jump following the same meet.Fagan tied Gusin's personal best with her own personal best, matching Gusin at 6-feet-2.75 to win the event. Her jump tied her with Gusin for the national lead this year, as well as the No. 2 position on Georgia’s all-time top-ten record list, along with Gusin and 2016 Olympic finalist Levern Spencer. Fagan, the Los Gatos, California native, now has the highest mark of an American in 2017 and is tied for fourth in the world. She is coming off of last season as the 2016 SEC outdoor champion and the NCAA outfoor runner-up.",Matthew Couper | Contributor,sports,https://www.redandblack.com/sports/mady-fagan-named-sec-co-field-athlete-of-the-week/article_9ff78c52-e25a-11e6-b639-27c6a109e09b.html
25-Jan-17,Georgia to play Missouri in first game at SunTrust Park,"Ironically, the first game open to the public in the new Atlanta Braves stadium, SunTrust Park, will not be a Braves game; it will be a Southeastern Conference match-up between Georgia and Missouri. The two teams will conclude their series at the new home of the Braves on Saturday, April 8 at 1:30 p.m. The game will benefit the Children’s Healthcare of Atlanta.“This college matchup will be the first time the general public can really immerse themselves in SunTrust Park,” said Derek Schiller, the Braves president of business. “With the excitement building around the ballpark, we think we have a great opportunity to have a large crowd in attendance, which would mean a lot of money raised for Children’s Healthcare of Atlanta.”


 


Georgia is set to host the opening of the Missouri series at Foley Field on April 6-7 before playing the final game at SunTrust Park.“Our players and staff are very excited to have this unique opportunity to play the first game open to the public at SunTrust Park,” Georgia head coach Scott Stricklin said. “I would like to thank the Atlanta Braves organization, Children’s Healthcare of Atlanta and the Southeastern Conference for making this possible.”The Braves open up their 2017 season on the road at New York, Pittsburgh and Miami before coming back to Atlanta for the first major league game to be played at SunTrust Park on April 14. Georgia will play again at SunTrust Park on May 9 at 7 p.m. in the 15th annual Spring Baseball Classic for Kids, which is the concluding game of Georgia’s series with Georgia Tech. This game will also benefit Children’s Healthcare of Atlanta.",Tori McElhaney | Assistant Sports Editor,sports,https://www.redandblack.com/sports/georgia-to-play-missouri-in-first-game-at-suntrust-park/article_8b3134c0-e323-11e6-8f66-af9c7aefa55e.html
25-Jan-17,A guide to summer internships,"As the spring semester starts picking up, the opportunity to apply for summer internships are starting to increase as well. For many college students, this is the time when the panic and pressure to land a spot starts to set in. Internships are no easy task, but there are a few ways to get ahead of the game.1. Toss your hat in the ring“Apply to a variety of internships,” said Samantha Meyer, lead career consultant at the UGA Career Center. “They’re competitive but y'all are getting a lot of good training.”Having previous internship experience, being involved on campus and having hobbies related to the kind of career you want to pursue can give students an edge Meyer said. She recommended applying to a variety of internships and not expect to hear from all of them.2. Tailor your resume and cover letterMeyer advised students to read the job description for the internship and tailor each individual resume and cover letter to fit.“You should not be sending the same resume and cover letter to every employer,” Meyer said. “That’s really hard to hear, that’s a lot of work, but that’s what’s really going to help you stand out.”Kyla Brinkley, a junior PR major from Johns Creek has been interning with See Spark Go, a media relations organization during the summer and throughout the school year. She applied when the summer application first came out, got through the interview process and was chosen to intern.Brinkley advised fellow students to go to as many events as possible to meet recruiters and employers. “I would also say it’s important to use the resources on campus like the career center to help with cover letters, resumes and applications because they’re so helpful,” She said.3. NetworkJustin Nima, a junior management major from Peachtree City has an internship lined up with Global Brands Group. Rather than applying online and doing a formal interview, he received this opportunity by using his network to find an internship.Nima spent the fall semester in Hong Kong and socialized with many of the students there, one of whom had connections to the company. He got his foot in the door when she invited him out to dinner with company employees. From there Nima said he kept the conversation more intellectual in order to show that he would fit in with the company image and culture.“It was a compilation of networking and socializing in SOHO with high-up members of Global Brands Group,” Nima said. “I met one of the EVPs as well as the VP of accounting.”Meyer recommended students to find internship opportunities at the career fair where employers specifically have hiring needs. There, they should introduce themselves with an elevator pitch and turn the conversation back to the employer in order to make a good first impression.“Your goal there is to talk to people there to learn about their opportunities and showcase that you are a good fit,” Meyers said. “Those are really good opportunities to connect with people and get internships from that.”4. Have an elevator speech downAn elevator speech is a 30-second spiel that includes career goals and past experiences while still giving the listener an idea of who you are. Oftentimes, a student can tailor their elevator speech to the employer.Meyer recommended students to do research ahead of networking and career fair events and to check online for the specific positions available.“Things you would talk about would be what you’re studying, what some of your past experience have been that relates to the kind of role you’d like in the future,” Meyer said. “And then you would sort of end with something that would turn the conversation back over.”

26-Jan-17,Steps to sustainability: UGA's initiatives to be a greener campus,"The creation of the Green Fee in 2008 funded the University of Georgia Office of Sustainability’s opening in 2010, and since then, the office has created a 10-year sustainability plan where they outlined goals to be a more environmentally-friendly campus in five main categories: energy, transportation, land management, waste reduction and education and research and service. By 2020, the office plans to have a 20 percent reduction in carbon emissions, 25 percent reduction in energy consumption and a 65 percent reduction in landfill waste.At the office’s year in review at the end of the fall semester, David Lee, vice president for the Office of Research, presented the office’s accomplishments so far.


 


Since 2007, the university has reduced water usage by 31 percent, energy consumption by 20 percent and carbon emissions by eight percent.At 84 percent, UGA’s carbon emissions come from using fossil fuels for energy. The university spends $18 million annually because of energy costs, a number that’s projected to decrease as the campus moves toward fossil fuel alternatives. UGA partnered with Georgia Power for a one-megawatt solar tracking and demonstration project on South Milledge Avenue which became active the beginning of last year and is one of the largest dual-axis solar trackers in the country.“It’s not only helping to create power for [the local electric] grid, but it’s serving as a research project for UGA, particularly our college of engineering,” Lee said. The office also plans to add three-megawatts of solar power at the UGA Tifton campus by 2020 and has raised $10 million from the state of Georgia to buy 19 electric buses.As the office has continued to expand, students have the option to add a Certificate of Sustainability to their degree, a program that’s also growing rapidly. From one graduate in the spring of 2016 to 30 students enrolled in the fall to 78 students enrolled now, curriculum intern Nirav Ilango, a sophomore geography and computer science major from John’s Creek, said the program’s administrators didn’t expect such an immediate interest.“We have no idea how big the program will be,” Ilango said. “It could go to 200 students or to 100 or 90. We want to make sure we can handle that with changes to the website and making sure we can interact with students.”


 


The certificate is a 17-hour program where students are required to take one anchor course, a course from each of the ecological, economical and social spheres, two semesters of a seminar and a capstone course. To complete the certificate, students must also create a portfolio. “Getting the Certificate of Sustainability allows you to focus on two things,” Ilango said. “Interdisciplinary learning, or being able to take courses over a wide range of majors that are specifically tailored to sustainability and for other perspectives to your field and applied learning with the capstone and portfolio.”Once Ron Balthazor, director of the certificate, approves the application, a checklist and work plan for the capstone project will open up that outlines the course requirements and directions and can be updated as each step is completed.Despite the small number of graduates, their capstone projects at the end of the program have made a significant influence in the university’s efforts toward sustainability.

Illango said Lindsey Bineau, a graduate of the program, conducted a study on different universities that have eliminated trays in the dining halls and presented her research to UGA Food Services. After UGA Food Services conducted a two-week long tray-less dining experiment at Snelling Dining Hall in February 2015, they found reductions in water and food waste. “We’ve seen a reduction in our food costs as a result of that,” said Bryan Varin, interim director of UGA Food Services. “There’s less food being consumed and being placed on their plates. There has been a reduction in food waste, and it’s been pretty profound.”


TNCMS.AdManager.render({region: 'fixed-big-ad-bottom-asset', slot: 1, fold: ""below""});


Kevin Kirsche, director of the Office of Sustainability, said tray-less dining saved $1 million per year in food waste.Even so, communication studies majors Carly Cullen and Tim del Risco found that 280,000 pounds of food are still wasted per semester in the dining halls. “It’s a lot of compost,” Cullen said. “Yes we’ve moved our waste to composting most of it, but now it’s a huge load on UGArden, the volunteers and the workers. We were looking to minimize the waste in general—the amount we’re composting and the amount we’re putting in the landfills.”Students’ food waste in the dining halls, as well as leftover food from the line, goes into a pulper to reduce the mass of food and extract the water. The pulped food is sent to the bioconversion center to be composted. UGA dining started composting in April of 2014 for sustainability reasons, Varin said.“Most all of our sustainability initiatives we like to include the Office of Sustainability into those initiatives because they’re great partners for us and can help us navigate through research or issues that come up,” Varin said. Every week, Kirsche said dining sends 10,000 pounds of food scraps to UGA’s Bioconversion Center, which is then processed into nutrient-rich compost and used around campus for landscaping or sold to the community.Former compost intern Melissa Gurevitch, a senior environmental engineering major from Decatur, said because of the volume of food scraps at the center, it takes about a year for the materials, which includes food scraps, paper towels and compostable plates and bowls, to break down.


                       +3

This time could take longer or shorter depending on the size and management of the compost piles.“It’s really neat how cyclical the process is, too,” Gurevitch said. “It starts off as food and ends up as food again.”The Office of Sustainability’s student-run compost program adds to these piles with 6,000 food scraps collected around campus a year, Kirsche said.Compost bins are usually located in teacher lounges or offices, and the program’s long-term goal is to make the compost bins as accessible as recycling and landfill bins.Gurevitch said that the program is working with University Housing to add compost bins to some of the residents halls and expand into more public places from there. There is a person in each building in charge of educating others on compost to reduce contamination, and the program’s main concern is making sure materials like plastic, cardboard meat and dairy, which cannot be composted, do not contaminate the load when they expand.Compost interns pick up the bins every week, which takes about six hours to get all the bins, and adds those food scraps to the dining hall compost and taken to the Bioconversion Center.

UGA graduate Mason Towe spearheaded the side-by-side recycling and landfill bins around campus, and said there are over 1,500 bins in over 100 buildings around UGA.

The intern will soon be picking up the compost bins via an electric bike provided by the Office of Sustainability as a more eco-friendly way to collect the scraps. “We’re still working out the kinks with how logistics are going to work, but it should be running in the next week or two,” Gurevitch said. Towe worked to standardize the bins to minimize confusion on what can and cannot be recycled and make it just as easy to recycle something as it is to throw it away.In addition, these bins are single-stream recycling, which means all approved recyclables can be put into one bin. Though this process makes recycling easier, it also adds to confusion and contamination problems.Towe said Athens-Clarke County’s tagline for major contaminates is “The Three F’s,” which includes food, foam and film. 

When food is in the recycling loads, it attracts pests and ruins recyclable materials. Foam and plastic film aren’t cost effective and can ruin the machinery at the center, Towe said.To combat this issue specifically in residence halls, Jane Diener, sustainability coordinator for housing, said that education is their main way to curb contamination.“One of the best ways that I’ve noticed to educate people [about contamination] is bringing the lids to the recycling and in person saying, ‘where does this piece of trash go?’” Diener said.Signs above the recycling and landfill bins also show which materials can be recycled. Diener worked with the Office of Sustainability to create signs that had the office’s seal but was unique to housing. They recently updated the signs to accommodate for commonly thrown away items, such as juice containers or solo cups.

“Students weren’t quite getting what we meant by wrappers and mixed metals, so we wanted to be a little more specific with it,” Diener said.They took away pizza boxes on the list of recyclable items and changed it to “clean food boxes” because of issues with food contamination.

“Most of our staff members if they see a simple piece of tape or easily accessible Jittery Joe’s coffee cup, they’ll pick it from the top and take the non-contaminated recycling out,” Diener said.Housing has clear bags for recycling and black bags for loads set for the landfill. The staff decides where they send the recycling depending on if it’s contaminated or not. “The bins aren’t very large, so if it’s contaminated a little bit, then it’s probably contaminating the entire load,” Diener said. Facilities Management Division then picks up dumpsters and curbside waste around campus, and they also look at the loads and make a decision on whether to bring it to the recycling center.ACC has a grading system to judge the amount of contamination. Kirsche said in general, if over 10 percent of the load is contaminated then the center’s manager would reject it.“Recycling markets are struggling right now, so they’re trying to be more selective on what comes in so that they can continue to make recycling feasible,” Towe said.In 2014, UGA had a six percent decrease in landfill waste since 2010, cutting down 295 tons. They’re still working toward their 2020 goal of a 65 percent reduction of materials in the landfill. “Brought together, these small things are creating healthier and more resilient communities,” Kirsche said.",Erin Schilling | Staff Writer,uganews,https://www.redandblack.com/uganews/steps-to-sustainability-uga-s-initiatives-to-be-a-greener/article_fdfec12a-e364-11e6-bdc7-d7521c922f4f.html
27-Jan-17,Georgia baseball team has surplus of youth heading into 2017 season,"When the Georgia Bulldogs take to the diamond in 21 days to play the College of Charleston at Foley Field, there will be plenty of new faces. 17 players on the 35-man roster will play in their first season as Bulldogs. But starting the year off with 14 freshmen out of high school and just one senior doesn’t scare head coach Scott Stricklin. “You’re going to see a bunch of freshmen,” Stricklin said. “There’s going to be a game at some point this year that we start the game with seven freshmen on the field.”


 


One position where Stricklin might need his young players to step up is at shortstop. Nick King will no longer be manning the shortstop position after starting 107 games there as a Bulldog. King provided a sure-handed glove, as he finished with a .960 fielding percentage. He ended his career with a .239 batting average. Players who are vying for that shortstop position are junior Trey Logan and freshmen Will Proctor and Cam Shepherd. But that position should not be a vacancy throughout the season despite the loss of a senior leader, according to Stricklin. “There’s not going to be a glaring hole very long,” Stricklin said. “When you watch Cam Shepherd roll around out there, you’re going to understand why we’re so excited about him. He’s as good a shortstop as you’re going to find in college baseball.”Shepherd was the No. 2 shortstop in Georgia by Perfect Game standards. The Peachtree Ridge High School graduate hit .500 with three home runs, 11 RBI and scored 24 runs as a senior. Shepherd has already had an impression on a player who he could potentially be turning double plays with in the infield. “He’s been there since the start of fall practices,” L.J. Talley, who started 50 games at second base last season, said. “He’s done a really good job.”  


 


Regardless of who earns the starting spot at shortstop this year, Stricklin will be relying on that player heavily. “That’s the leader of your infield, you could argue that’s the leader of your team, him and the catcher” Stricklin said. Even though the departure of seven players who signed professional contracts with MLB teams will surely hurt Georgia, there is a certain spark brought to this year’s team thanks to the freshmen.At least that’s what the team’s leader in RBI last season thinks. “We’re going to miss them because they’re really good guys,” outfielder Keegan McGovern said. “But I think all these freshmen just bring that edge out here everyday to practice. I’m really looking forward to the season.”",John Durham | Senior Staff Writer,sports,https://www.redandblack.com/sports/georgia-baseball-team-has-surplus-of-youth-heading-into-season/article_8c626328-e4db-11e6-84ad-7b1be1968156.html
28-Jan-17,Georgia track and field prepares for important meet at Razorback Invitational,"The Georgia track and field teams are already halfway through their indoor season, and with only two regular season meets remaining, the postseason is quickly approaching. This weekend’s trip to Fayetteville, Arkansas for the Razorback Invitational will go a long way towards determining the direction of the rest of the season.Both the No. 4 men’s and No. 3 women’s teams are coming off strong performances in their first two meets of the season. Senior Tatiana Gusin and junior Mady Fagan both tied the number two spot on Georgia’s all-time top 10 list for the high jump. In the long jump, junior Keturah Orji tied her own No. 5 mark on the top ten record list, and sophomore teammate Kate Hall set the No. 6 spot.“They understand the expectations and the goals of this team, and when you have strong leadership, the youngsters will follow,” head coach Petros Kyprianou said. “Our three big things are preparation, laser focus, and a sense of urgency, and every meet I see those three aspects getting a little bit better.”


 


The offseason conditioning and training by the athletes has been evident in competition so far. They have appeared to be in midseason form at the start of the year.The track season ranges from January to June with the indoor and outdoor seasons. The conditioning and preparation done in the months away from competition are what will determine the success for the Bulldogs through the remainder of the indoor season, and over the next several months.“They are performing really well, and the fact that we have had nice weather has allowed us to get some early good marks,” Kyprianou said. “At the end of the day, as good as we are right now, it means absolutely nothing if we don’t repeat that or do even better in March.”The focus as the Southeastern Conference and NCAA indoor championships approach has clearly shifted to the track.With many jumpers and throwers having already set high marks and positioned themselves well for the championships, the running has been a step behind. The times in the sprints and distance runs will have to improve for the Bulldogs to contend for the indoor championships.“We’ve got to get better on the track. We have to find ways to produce some NCAA qualifiers on the track besides the jumps, the combined events and the throws,” Kyprianou said. “We have a very young crew, but the upperclassmen are so strong and dominant that it would be a shame not to surround them with some good runners.”Some of the drops in production can be attributed to the youth of many of the athletes. The talent is there, but the growth and experience that comes with competing at the collegiate level has yet to develop.“Competitiveness is highly contagious, so when you have those people around the youngsters, you can see that sort of attitude implanted within them,” Kyprianou said. “We are excited for the future.”


 


The culture of the program has had a complete turnaround since Kyprianou took over as head coach last season. He set his sights on developing a winning culture across all events, and being able to spread positive energy throughout all the athletes. Focus and positive mindsets for the athletes could make the difference for the Bulldogs as they look to hit their first peak at the coming championships.Georgia has two meets left to fine tune each event and prepare for indoor postseason competition.“Like coach Suzanne Yoculan said when she was here winning all those NCAA titles in gymnastics, ‘losers make excuses, winners make adjustments,’ and that’s really what I want my team to think like,” Kyprianou said.",Matthew Couper | Contributor,sports,https://www.redandblack.com/sports/georgia-track-and-field-prepares-for-important-meet-at-razorback/article_6ff7b5b8-e4b7-11e6-92aa-9ffac55915a4.html
28-Jan-17,Kendell Williams and Shelby Ashe lead Georgia on first day of Razorback Invitational,"Senior Kendell Williams set the third-highest mark in the world this year for the pentathlon on Friday in Fayetteville, Arkansas at the Razorback Invitational. It was also the highest NCAA score this season.Williams scored 4,476 as she looks to be the first woman to win four NCAA titles in the pentathlon. Her true freshman teammate Louisa Grauvogel placed fourth in the event, and her score put her at No. 7 all-time at Georgia.The No. 4 men's team and No. 3 women's team tallied three other wins on the opening day of the meet.


 


“Kendell punched her ticket to the NCAA Championships with her score and it is always nice for us to get another national leader as the postseason approaches,” head coach Petros Kyprianou said.Senior Shelby Ashe recorded a new personal record in the weight throw. It was her third win of the season thus far. Freshman Beatrice Llano took seventh place in the event.“I think above everything that happened today, Shelby’s performance was our highlight,” Kyprianou said. “We made her a captain for her final season and it’s paying off. I am so pleased Shelby’s final season has started this way.”In the heptathlon, Devon Williams locked in a personal-best 3,307 in day one of the event. Junior Karl Saluri goes into day two in third position.Junior Keturah Orji moved into second in the nation in a long jump, a week after taking control of the national triple jump lead. She hit a personal record of 21 feet, 9 inches. Kate Hall brought home second place in the event for the Georgia women.Freshman Darius Carbin jumped over seven feet for the third consecutive meet, and won his second high jump event in a row. He cleared the bar at 7-feet-3.25 on his first jump, securing the No. 5 spot all-time at Georgia.“Darius beat an elite field today and I hope he continues to build from here, and I believe he will,” said Kyprianou.",Matthew Couper | Contributor,sports,https://www.redandblack.com/sports/kendell-williams-and-shelby-ashe-lead-georgia-on-first-day/article_a049036e-e586-11e6-8154-33bf769afe82.html
29-Jan-17,Georgia equestrian drops to 4-4 after loss to No. 2 Baylor,"Saturday afternoon in Waco, Texas, the No. 2 Baylor equestrian team edged out No. 4 Georgia by three points with a final score of 10-7. Georgia fell to a 4-4 record, while Baylor advanced to 8-2.Baylor pulled away in the second half of the meet after leading by just one point following the first two events.“We came out today looking at a target of personal growth,” head coach Meghan Boenig said. “In that respect we did a great job. We had some tough rides and some tremendous progress from warm-ups to competition.”


 


Senior Meg O’Mara remains undefeated thus far this season in Equitation on the Flat after defeating Baylor’s Madison Day 72-70. She scored the team’s only point to defend her perfect record of 8-0.Junior Kyndall Harper received Most Outstanding Performance honors after scoring Georgia’s first point in Reining with a season-high score of 73.

Junior Payton Anderson earned a point for Georgia with a team-high of 75. In the anchor position, junior Bailey Anderson closed out the event by earning a point with a score of 72.“The outcome is not what we wanted, but it’s about that next step as we prepare for the rest of the season,” Boenig said. “I love the attitude and fire we saw today. This is a group that’s ready to turnover and produce something great.”Georgia will compete at home next weekend in a double-header with South Carolina and Delaware State.",Lauren D'Ambra | Contributor,sports,https://www.redandblack.com/sports/georgia-equestrian-drops-to---after-loss-to-no/article_ead0f60e-e5c6-11e6-946a-af834dfa0bd7.html
29-Jan-17,Scouting Report: D'Antne Demery,"Georgia has signed four-star offensive tackle D’Antne Demery.A Brunswick native, Demery is ranked as the No. 22 offensive tackle in the nation by 247Sports. The U.S. Army All-American has been committed to the Bulldogs since June 15. The offensive line has been a focus of the 2017 recruiting class, as Demery is one of six offensive linemen committed to the class.Strengths:


 


Demery’s massive size makes him a formidable blocker. At 6-foot-5 and 320 pounds, Demery is big enough to go toe-to-toe with college level defensive players. For his size, Demery is incredibly quick. On pulls, he can move down the line of scrimmage in plenty of time to make his block, and he can get ahead of the ball carrier to block in the second level.Weaknesses:An offensive lineman has to be able to use his hands properly when blocking. Demery has a tendency to let his hands go outside when blocking defenders. Against the quicker, more agile defensive ends Demery will see in the Southeastern Conference, this mistake will likely result in either a missed block or a holding penalty.Final Take:Although his technique needs some work, Demery checks all the boxes in the natural skills department. His size and athleticism are exactly what is needed for an SEC-caliber offensive tackle. Demery has the potential to make an immediate impact for the Bulldogs, as he possesses the ability to create huge holes and sustain crucial blocks for both Nick Chubb and Sony Michel this fall.",Alex Soderstrom | Staff Writer,sports,https://www.redandblack.com/sports/scouting-report-d-antne-demery/article_a6d575d8-e6a2-11e6-a9fd-333fc461ba6e.html
30-Jan-17,Scouting Report: Andrew Thomas,"Andrew Thomas signed with Georgia early this morning, made an appearance at the college football hall of fame and was part of a signing ceremony at his high school, Pace Academy.All the commotion is warranted for this Georgia signee.Thomas is a four-star recruit, and is ranked as the nation’s No. 9 offensive tackle, according to 247Sports. Thomas is the No. 1 lineman in the state of Georgia and has chosen to stay in the state for college after having offers from 29 different schools.


 


Strengths:Pace head coach Chris Slade said Thomas' best attributes are his patience, intelligence, athleticism and length. Slade said Thomas could play anywhere on the offensive line and be able to pick up blitzes and know the protections.Thomas' ability to pass protect will contribute greatly to Georgia’s offensive line. At a staggering height of 6-foot-5 and weight of 330 pounds, Thomas uses this strength to be an excellent run blocker. Despite his size, Thomas has exceptional lateral foot skills and uses this to maintain leverage and balance against opponents for both run and pass blocking assignments. He plays through the whistle and has an aura of intensity about him when he is on the field.Weaknesses:In order to protect Georgia's quarterbacks in the years to come, Pace Academy head football coach Chris Slade said Thomas will have to improve his upper body strength. Playing in smaller divisions in high school, Thomas got away with his sheer size. That won't be the case in the Southeastern Conference.Final Take:Recruiting a group of skilled offensive lineman was a primary concern for this year’s class. Thomas fulfills this major priority for the Bulldogs, and has had a strong lean towards Georgia from the very beginning despite being a highly coveted offensive lineman across the nation. If he can get stronger quickly, he will become a real force on this Georgia football team.",Anna Glenn Grove | Contributor,sports,https://www.redandblack.com/sports/scouting-report-andrew-thomas/article_07a2fd30-e76c-11e6-aae3-4f3c7c008c23.html
31-Jan-17,When Georgia commits and targets will sign on National Signing Day,"National Signing Day can be a mad fury of commitments that come all at the same time or dead periods in which no one decides to put on a hat with a college logo for hours on end.Through the confusion and noise, the Red & Black is here to make sense of it all leading up to and on Wednesday, Feb. 1.Below is a schedule of when decisions will be made by recruits who are undecided as well as when the recruits who have verbally committed to Georgia will sign their national letters of intent. Both will have a significant effect on Georgia’s 2017 recruiting class.

1-Feb-17,Scouting Report: Devonte Wyatt,"Defensive tackle Devonte Wyatt verbally committed to Georgia last summer, but he had some doubts leading into today with South Carolina and University of Florida showing him heavy attention. Wyatt even visited the Florida Gators this past weekend, but he still committed to the Bulldogs.Strengths:Standing at 6-foot-4 and 300 pounds, Wyatt ranks in the top 15 defensive tackles in the country, according to 247Sports. Wyatt’s speed for a defensive tackle will be a bonus for the Bulldogs, as his 40-yard dash clocks in at 4.6. 


 


Wyatt has a tenacious mindset off the snap, which will make him a threat to his future targets. He’s a motor that doesn’t stop running until the whistle is blown. Wyatt also is comfortable playing defensive end as well. Weaknesses:With sophomores like Trent Thompson already filling the defensive tackle position, Wyatt will most likely have a slow start into the Bulldogs’ rotation. Wyatt will have to step back and let the veterans teach him some plays before he steps on the field.Though he has the speed and size, he is 15 to 20 pounds over the ideal weight. Coach Kirby Smart and his coaching staff might expect Wyatt to drop some weight to compete. Final take:Wyatt needs to take full advantage of summer training. There are multiple players in his position who still have a few years left for the Bulldogs, so he will have many veterans to learn from in his freshman year.  If Wyatt can cut back in weight, he will be ideal for Georgia’s defense. But Wyatt isn’t a player just taking up space on the field to block; he scouts out his opponent as well. He will have to adjust to sharing his playing time, but he will learn and grow from some of the best in the defensive tackle position in the Southeastern Conference.",Mary Ramsaier | Staff Writer,sports,https://www.redandblack.com/sports/scouting-report-devonte-wyatt/article_a6c77642-e696-11e6-b752-db73b12959a1.html
1-Feb-17,Devonte Wyatt makes history for high school in signing with Georgia,"For Towers High School, the first Wednesday of every February is usually not much different than every other day in the east Atlanta suburb of Decatur.While most of the rest of the country is sent into a frenzy by college football prospects signing with their choice of school and announcing who they will play for in the coming years, Towers stays quiet.But this year, signing day was different.


 


Spotlight shone on the school, as the attention turned to four-star defensive tackle Devonte Wyatt and where he would play college football. Granted, the element of surprise was absent, as Wyatt was committed to Georgia since August and reaffirmed his commitment to the Bulldogs the night before signing day.It didn’t seem to make the day any less special at Towers, however. This year, friends, family, and classmates gathered in the auditorium at the school for a special ceremony to watch Wyatt and seven of his high school teammates sign their letters of intent.To understand what exactly it means for Wyatt to sit on-stage in Towers’ auditorium, sporting a bright red Georgia jacket as he signs to play between the hedges for head coach Kirby Smart, one must first know what it means for the community Wyatt hails from.Devonte Wyatt is all smiles following signing his letter of intent to attend Georgia #NSD17 #UGA pic.twitter.com/XyuwF23VGe— Zach Shugan (@ZachShugan) February 1, 2017It’s certainly not an every day occurence at Towers when one of your own makes it official that he will be playing Division I football at an in-state powerhouse like Georgia. Despite the school’s proximity to Athens, Wyatt is the first player from Towers to sign to play at Georgia in over 40 years.“It’s a great thing,” Wyatt said. “I’m the second player out of my school to go to the University of Georgia.”Most of all, Wyatt hopes other kids growing up in the Towers' school district will take his commitment to the Bulldogs and see that it can be done.


 


“I want people to look up to stories like this,” Wyatt said. “It was nice to see all the parents out here with their sons going to college.”While Wyatt’s letter of intent is now in the hands of the Georgia coaching staff, the ceremony Wednesday morning didn’t go off without a hitch. After Wyatt put the pen to paper and signed the dotted line, there were challenges in faxing the documents to Georgia. It took Towers head coach Dr. Brian Montgomery some extra work and a scanner to get the papers to the powers that be at Georgia, but they got there eventually. In all fairness, technology has made some advances since the last time someone from Towers committed to the Bulldogs.Now that his letter of intent is in, what’s next for the 6-foot-4, 300-pound pass rusher? What is he most excited for in the coming months and his freshman year? “I’m ready to get to working out and for the games to start,” Wyatt said.",Zach Shugan | Staff Writer,sports,https://www.redandblack.com/sports/devonte-wyatt-makes-history-for-high-school-in-signing-with/article_26e1e238-e8ac-11e6-a8a3-0bc74e15f28e.html
1-Feb-17,Scouting Report: Robert Beal,"Robert Beal is a defensive end from Suwanee, although he could also play outside linebacker in college. 247Sports lists him as a four-star prospect, while ESPN gave him a five-star distinction.He was committed to play for Notre Dame at one point, but Beal decommitted from the Irish and made a verbal commitment to come to Georgia on July 5 of last year.On Wednesday afternoon, he followed through with that commitment and signed his national letter of intent with Georgia.


 


StrengthsBeal’s biggest strength is his athleticism. He is one of the fastest players you will see playing on a defensive line.Beal’s athleticism also gives him great versatility, as he has the speed to play either defensive end or outside linebacker. He can get to the quarterback, but he’s also a good enough athlete to drop back into coverage if it’s needed of him. Beal does not shy away from physical contact, but his speed and agility usually allow him to run around opposing offensive linemen.WeaknessesWhile Beal is certainly a gifted rusher, his pass rushing skills still need to improve for him to succeed at the next level.As is often the case with players as athletically gifted as Beal, he was able to beat blockers through pure talent, but that will not be the case against starting tackles in the Southeastern Conference. Beal is also a bit undersized for a defensive end in Division I football. He currently weighs in at 230 pounds, and he will need to put on weight before seeing the field for Georgia.Final TakeBeal is one of the best athletes who Georgia is recruiting on the defensive side of the ball.


 


He has both speed and quickness, and he will be a nightmare for offensive tackles who lack the athleticism to prevent him from getting around the edge.Beal is undersized for his position, but if he can gain weight without losing speed he will make things difficult for opposing SEC quarterbacks. Beal will have time to gain weight as there are older players on the depth chart ahead of him.",Nathan Berg | Senior Staff Writer,sports,https://www.redandblack.com/sports/scouting-report-robert-beal/article_b8094a26-e76c-11e6-81da-979ffa2ab213.html
1-Feb-17,Scouting Report: Nate McBride,"Georgia picked up another member of the 2017 class with inside linebacker Nate McBride. He is the sixth-best player in his position in the nation and chose Georgia over schools such as Auburn, Alabama and Oregon. The in-state prospect from Vidalia committed to become a Bulldog on Christmas Day with an elaborate video.Strengths:McBride displays a rare combination of size and speed. He is a strong, 220-pound linebacker who has the ability to keep up with the fastest offensive players. McBride also runs track, with school records in the 100 and 200 meters, and he was part of the state-championship winning 4x100 relay team last year. McBride accelerates down the field and can tackle well in open space. His highlight film also shows his ability to strip balls and his experience playing on punt returns and punt coverage.


 


Weaknesses:What held McBride back the most in high school had nothing to do with his performance on the field. Before his team’s first scrimmage, McBride was in a car accident that caused him to miss his entire junior season. He broke bones in his left hand and broke his right wrist. During the track season in 2016, McBride also had a hamstring injury.Final Take:McBride clearly has the potential to develop into a strong college player. He comes into a Georgia position group that features Natrez Patrick, Reggie Carter and Roquan Smith, who all had significant playing time last year. Even if those older athletes keep their place ahead of McBride on the depth chart, the incoming linebacker could still see the field on special teams early in his Georgia career.",Emily Giambalvo | Senior Staff Writer,sports,https://www.redandblack.com/sports/scouting-report-nate-mcbride/article_eaad5492-e88c-11e6-a909-076ea34e7c29.html
1-Feb-17,"Feeding 30,000: the logistics of UGA Food Services","University of Georgia Food Services serves tons of food every semester, and the central storage building which keeps all this food is almost the size of half a football field. Making sure all of the food gets eaten involves a lot of planning and logistics.“It’s a huge place, and it’s always full of food...so just imagine filling that building every 30 days,” said Jorge Noriega, executive chef of Food Services and associate director of Culinary Development.With over 30,000 meals served daily, dining services has to know what to serve and how much, balancing customer satisfaction and food waste reduction. They use several avenues, from production sheets to student feedback, to gather data and information for these decisions.


 


“We know, almost to, I think it’s a five percent accuracy, how many people are gonna walk through the doors during those days. So we order accordingly,” Noriega said.Dining services uses a system, with almost 18 years worth of data, called FoodPro in order to make such predictions. Every day they use the data to keep track of how much of each type of food is served.“All the team members that you see, besides serving and keeping everything nice, clean and fresh, they’re recording every single thing that they serve,” Noriega said.The staff does this using production sheets, which are then put into FoodPro’s system. Food served in chafing dishes are weighed while foods such as cookies are counted individually.“They’re recording how much they make, how much they put on the line and how much has come back,” said Allison Brannen, Dining Service’s marketing coordinator.This information helps factor what foods are on the menu. If data shows a menu item isn’t being consumed often, it could mean the item is ready to be taken off the menu.Other than data, UGA uses both seasonal and student factors to decide the dining hall menus.“We offer a warm weather menu and a cool weather menu. So you’ll see the menu adjust with the seasons...It’s the best practice we’ve implemented,” Brannen said.


 


Not only do some foods complement the temperature of certain seasons, but some foods, like strawberries, need to be in season to be flavorful. So food items “naturally rotate” into the menu.“It’s more or less about the flavor, for us...Our new leadership believes that we need to offer the best tasting foods that we can, and I believe that too,” Noriega said.Some menu items are a favorite among students and would be very difficult to remove.“Chicken fingers. Chicken fingers and chicken nuggets...Even if I wanted to I couldn’t take them off of the menu,” Noriega said.Noriega said they went through close to “10 to 13 tons” of nuggets per semester.Other items, such as vegan or vegetarian options, may not be the most popular amongst students, but would still be difficult to remove. The total popularity of these items are “curved” because of student feedback to keep them.“We are constantly getting feedback too, through a number of different avenues,” Brannen said.Brannen said a very popular method that dining services uses is their mobile feedback, an option on their mobile website where students can email comments to dining services.

""In general, I think it's pretty nice. I don't know. They could always do better I guess, but I don't really find anything really lacking."" said Quentin Smith, Sophomore music major from Athens. ""I think I've submitted something online once. Like a feedback thing one time."" They also use a Mystery Shopper program, where select students, who remain anonymous to the dining employees, come to the halls to dine and give their feedback.Brannen said that student feedback directly influences their food choices moving forward.Because dining services is a part of UGA’s Auxiliary Services, a division of UGA made up of seven different retail and service departments, it can work with the other branches for information, such as when students are moving out and how many.“It is a big family. We are a little bit of an unconventional big family, but we talk, we communicate,” Noriega said.Despite constant feedback and information, Noriega wished students would be more vocal on what they’re looking for.“This is your restaurant, you guys are our guests, you guys choose what you want to eat...At the end of the day, you guys are the ones that come in to eat,” Noriega said.",Benjamin Richmond | Contributor,uganews,https://www.redandblack.com/uganews/feeding-the-logistics-of-uga-food-services/article_2f4abcd8-e7d5-11e6-a94d-8345e3f4ffcb.html

1-Feb-17,Older players play critical role in Georgia's successful recruiting class,"The Georgia football team added 27 new scholarship players to its roster on National Signing Day. This outstanding haul reflects well on Kirby Smart in his first complete recruiting cycle as the head coach at Georgia. But according to Smart, the real credit for this class falls on the shoulders of the players that have been on the team long before Feb. 1.“I think a lot of credit goes to our roster too, because somebody has to recruit these kids,” Smart said on a televised Georgia recruiting program Wednesday. “It’s not just the coaches. When these kids come on visits, your team has to sell your program.”


 


The current Bulldogs recruiting the young pups can be broken down into two parts. First, there are the veterans who host and show around the recruits when they visit the campus. “The older guys like  [rising seniors] [Dominick] Sanders and Malkom Parrish, they definitely showed us around,” said five-star prospect Richard LeCounte III. “They let us know the do’s and don’t’s around here. It’s definitely something with the new system and the new culture around here when we come here. Losing is not something we accept.”Then, in December, another huge event occurred. Juniors Nick Chubb, Sony Michel, Lorenzo Carter and Davin Bellamy all announced they would return to Georgia for their senior season instead of declaring for the NFL Draft. “At the end of the day, good players recruit good players,” Smart said. “When your good players stay at your university, they help recruit the student-athletes that are coming to your place.”Defensive coordinator Mel Tucker described the players coming back as “motivating” to him as a coach. The younger players looked to these older guys and saw them as a reason to come play in Athens. Now, the older generation will have to be leaders. 


 


“Right now, it’s time for these guys to step up and take ownership of this team,” Tucker said.“They know exactly what we want out of them. They know what has to get done, how we want to play football, what the program expects. They know what it is. It’s up to these guys right now.”The veterans have been instrumental in helping Smart secure a top-three recruiting class in the country. And while this reflects well on Smart’s program, it also mirrors the commitment the Bulldog veterans have for their program.“It just tells you that everything’s heading the right way, that we’re doing things the right way,” Smart said. “Those kids want to be successful. The special thing is there’s a good group of them in this senior class that want to be successful for Georgia. They want Georgia to be in the right place.”",Jed May | Assistant Sports Editor,sports,https://www.redandblack.com/sports/older-players-play-critical-role-in-georgia-s-successful-recruiting/article_145ff1fa-e8c4-11e6-8df9-6b3cfa446c42.html
2-Feb-17,D'Andre Swift never wavered from commitment to Georgia,"Dec. 15 could have been a day that swayed running back D’Andre Swift away from Georgia. Current running backs Nick Chubb and Sony Michel both announced their decision to stay for their senior seasons. Swift, who had verbally committed to the Bulldogs on Sept. 1, would now come to Athens competing at the running back spot with Chubb and Michel, and now-sophomores Brian Herrien and Elijah Holyfield. Instead of having doubts, though, head coach Kirby Smart said Swift never reconsidered his commitment to Georgia when he heard Chubb and Michel were returning.


 


“He was unfazed by it,"" Smart said. ""[He said], ‘That’s awesome, Coach. I get to come in here and learn from two of the best.’ How many kids in America would say that today?”Swift officially signed on the dotted line today, which gave his new offensive coordinator Jim Chaney a reason to be ecstatic.“When [Swift] came to camp, the one thing about this young man is that he loves to compete,” Chaney said on the Georgiadogs signing day show. “I love that. He is walking through the door expecting to play and probably going to try to do it.”At 5-foot-10, 220 pounds, Swift’s strength fits right into Chaney’s desire to be a physical run team. But Swift also has the ability to slip through small gaps in the offensive line and run away from opposing defenses. “He’s got a little bit of Sony in him and he’s got a little bit of Nick in him, which I think is a good mixture,” Smart said.The four-star running back was rated as the No. 4 running back in the country according to 247Sports. During his senior season at Saint Joseph’s Preparatory School in Philadelphia, Swift ran for 1,564 yards and 25 touchdowns on 149 carries.Along with the impressive rushing statistics, Swift also proved to be a threat catching the ball out of the backfield. He accumulated 405 yards and nine touchdowns on 21 receptions during his senior year. Chaney said this was an area of Swift’s game he is looking forward to seeing when the running back steps on campus.“His ball skills are unbelievable as far as a running back goes,” Chaney said.  “His ability to detach and do things that other people can’t do at that position will be fun to utilize as we watch him grow in our offense.”


 


Smart said Swift could be a viable option in replacing Isaiah McKenzie in Georgia’s return game. McKenzie, who decided to enter the NFL Draft after this past season, accounted for all of Georgia’s punt return yards in 2016. “They all did a wonderful job recruiting [Swift],” Chaney said. “We are thrilled with him.”",Alexander T. Makrides | Senior Staff Writer,sports,https://www.redandblack.com/sports/d-andre-swift-never-wavered-from-commitment-to-georgia/article_70a655f8-e8ec-11e6-be59-d7717fb50a2e.html
2-Feb-17,Kirby Smart hauls in No. 3 recruiting class for Georgia,"It’s been 424 days since Kirby Smart was hired to be the head coach of the Georgia Bulldogs.After he led the Bulldogs to an underwhelming 8-5 record in his first season, he delivered perhaps the biggest victory in his young, head-coaching career on National Signing Day.   At the conclusion of signing day, Georgia is ranked as the No. 3 recruiting class in the nation behind Alabama and Ohio State, according to 247Sports, ESPN and Rivals.


 


“Exciting, uneventful day if there is such a thing as one,” Smart said Wednesday. “To bring these new guys into the program is really exciting for us as a staff.”This class is now tied with the 2006 recruits as the best haul in Georgia’s recruiting history since statistics have been kept. 2006 featured players such as Matthew Stafford, Knowshon Moreno and Akeem Dent, who were integral parts in the Sugar Bowl victory in 2007.20 recruits and six early enrollees make up the 2017 class for Georgia, highlighted by five-star players Richard LeCounte III and Isaiah Wilson. On top of that, Georgia added the most four-star recruits in the school’s history with 18 total players. That’s three more four-star recruits than back in 2006.Smart recognized the effort his players had in recruiting and the difference that was made, whether they be early enrollees or upperclassmen.“I had to put the reins on Richard [LeCounte III] and some of those guys because I think they thought they could recruit everybody in the country,” Smart said. “We’ve got a limited number of spots. Those guys are pretty aggressive.”Another factor that also helped give Smart an edge on the recruiting trail this year was time.In comparison to 2016 recruiting class, Smart had to scramble to keep former Mark Richt administration recruits after the long-time head coach was fired. Smart was coming off a national championship with Alabama in the College Football Playoff and was hired on Dec. 6, 2015.He didn’t have to worry about that this year.


 


“I remember being at the national championship game and during the time I got to recruit, I was on the phone with a lot of these guys,” Smart said. “The target was we’re going to go after these guys and get a really good class the full cycle. It paid off this year.”Now with a full year under his belt one thing has become quite clear. This is Smart’s recruiting class, for better or for worse.",John Durham | @johndurham32,sports,https://www.redandblack.com/sports/kirby-smart-hauls-in-no-recruiting-class-for-georgia/article_3d017448-e8d9-11e6-91cf-ebf62a690360.html
3-Feb-17,Students' passion for this year's Super Bowl varies based on region,"This story was written and reported by Emily Giambalvo, a senior staff writer at The Red & Black, and Mike Knittle, a journalist at the University of Massachusetts Amherst.Eric Demmer will start his Sunday by waking up at 4 a.m, getting on a plane with his family and flying to Houston.Demmer, a sophomore at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, will watch Super Bowl LI from inside NRG Stadium, hoping to witness the New England Patriots beat the Atlanta Falcons. After the game is over, Demmer will fly back to Massachusetts in time for his Monday classes.


 


“We are going to Houston and back all in one day so it’s going to about a long 20-hour day but I am excited to see if [Tom] Brady can win his fifth ring,” Demmer said.This will be the third time the Demmer family has made the trip to see the Patriots play in the Super Bowl.Ian Boatman, a senior at the University of Georgia, is accustomed to waking up in the middle of the night to head to a football game.He doesn’t mind it, though. It’s not like waking up for a dreaded 8 a.m. exam, he said. This is different. When he rises as early as 3:30 a.m. for games in Athens, it’s beginning a day that he said is “something out of a fairytale.”When Atlanta plays on Sunday, Boatman will simply watch from afar. He has supported the Falcons and most other Georgia professional teams throughout his childhood, but in his internal rankings of fandom, Georgia football reigns supreme.Both fanbases will turn their attention toward the game in Houston for a few hours on Sunday, but likely with a differing degree of devotion. Georgians still have a vested interest in their home-state team, especially since the Falcons have never won a Super Bowl. But still, on Georgia’s campus, football is perceived as a Saturday event. While in Massachusetts, the games that carry the most weight happen on Sundays.With countless gatherings and watch parties planned, the Super Bowl at UMass will be a major event. Administrators have taken precautionary steps, banning guests from entering the school’s dorms beginning at noon and adjusting security policies in anticipation of rowdiness.

As Sunday’s game draws closer, many Patriots fans at UMass have reiterated the same point — this is the year Tom Brady can win his fifth Super Bowl ring.UMass junior Alex Levitt, who’s also the sports director for WMUA radio, knows how important this ring would be for Brady.“In a matter of a three-hour game, we’re going to know if Tom Brady has the most super bowl rings of all time or not,” Levitt said. “It’s kind of a big deal.”The New England Patriots have been among the best in the NFL since their first Super Bowl victory in Super Bowl XXXVI in February 2002. Ever since then, Patriots fans have been spoiled with consistent winning, which has always raised the expectations fans have of the players and the team.“In my life, the Patriots have been dominant the entire time and that’s mainly what I have focused on,” Demmer said. “I would say professional football is what I care about most. Definitely more of the people I watch football with say they are more professionally oriented.”Since only some college athletes go on to play in the NFL, the professional version of the sport showcases a higher caliber of play. But for some, such as Georgia freshman Ansley Davenport, that difference makes it harder to become invested.Although Georgia quarterback Jacob Eason was one of the nation’s top recruits in 2016, he’s also a student at the university, just like the 27,000 other undergraduates. Davenport sees him in her American government class, whereas the players in the NFL seem more like superhumans. That sense of common ground, she said, makes the college level of the sport feel more personal.Meanwhile, those who will be playing on Sunday are paid millions of dollars, which furthers the gap of commonality between fans and athletes.

“The NFL is a business,” Boatman said. “It's not going to be the same as college.”On his way home from the hospital as a newborn, Boatman wore Georgia socks and a Georgia shirt. Peyton Ledford, a sophomore, grew up playing with a Georgia cheerleader Barbie doll. The ties to college programs run deep through families in the South and often start from a young age.“You can even develop rivalries in high school with you friends because of where their family went to school,” junior Eddie Lloyd said. “Whereas in the NFL, we lived about an hour south of Atlanta, so everybody there for the most part was a Falcons fan.”Lloyd considers himself at least an average Falcons fan and has gone to a few games. Still, he said he “probably wouldn't spend [his] own money on a ticket.”Yet, in his three years as a student in Athens, Lloyd has attended over 30 Georgia football games.

For UMass, the total combined home attendance for the 2016 season was only 87,059. Georgia surpassed that attendance mark at its 2016 spring scrimmage with 93,000 fans packing inside Sanford Stadium that day in April. During homecoming weekend at UMass, only 14,892 spectators attended the game against Tulane.Fans around Massachusetts generally place their attention on the Patriots, regardless of how the local college teams are doing.

When Falcons quarterback Matt Ryan played at Boston College, the Eagles were ranked No. 2 in the AP Poll. Still, the NFL took the forefront in Boston. The Patriots were undefeated at the time. That’s what football fans wanted to talk about.“It’s extremely clear that people in the Boston area do not care about college football whatsoever, to be honest,” Levitt said.Most students will attend the tailgate before UMass games and then leave before the game kicks off.“It is much different at Patriots games,” freshman Dan Gabriel said. “The tailgates just build suspense as they get closer to the game, so that when you are in the game everyone is pumped up and cheering, which doesn’t really happen here [at UMass].”But 1,000 miles away in Athens, Boatman — a member of the Spike Squad, a group of passionate students who paint themselves and wear pads with spikes — awakes at odd hours so he can make it to the student gate in time to ensure a front-row spot.When Ledford wakes up on a game day, the first thing she sees is a snapchat from her brother signing, “Saturday Night's Alright For Fighting,” which is played inside Sanford Stadium prior to Georgia games.“There's Christianity, Judaism, Islam, SEC football,” Boatman said. “The church is Sanford Stadium for a lot of us here in the city. It's what you grew up with, it's what you knew, and it's what you're passionate about.”What makes it special, he said, is “knowing that it’s going to continue forever,” even after his lifetime. And there’s likely a similar sentiment among Patriots fans. The balance between fans’ interests in the NFL and college football shifts depending on the region, but the influence of the sport is similar.

“It only takes a few minutes to really think about it and you start crying,” Boatman said, “because you think about just all the magic that you've been apart of for so long.”",Emily Giambalvo and Mike Knittle,sports,https://www.redandblack.com/sports/students-passion-for-this-year-s-super-bowl-varies-based/article_b0ada028-e99d-11e6-be86-f38cb4068e67.html
11-Feb-17,Georgia track starts strong at Music City Challenge,"Led by junior Keturah Orji and sophomore Keenon Laine, Georgia got off to a strong start Friday on day one of the Music City Challenge in Nashville, Tennessee.The Bulldogs tallied four collegiate victories and created momentum heading into day two of the competition on Saturday. Head coach Petros Kyprianou hopes their success will carry over to the postseason in a couple weeks.“I thought it was a good day, one that saw us put some more bullets in our chamber for NCAAs,” Kyprianou said.  “Like I told the team after the final event, we are like a band and everyone must be playing their instrument as well as they can.  If we are missing an instrument or have one that is out of sync, it affects everyone.  We are hoping another tune-up like this weekend helps us get ready for the postseason.”


 


Orji tied the No. 3 spot on the 2017 world list in the triple jump on her third attempt with a 46-3.25. The jump was the second-best mark of her indoor collegiate career.Junior Aliyah Johnson took home fifth place in the triple jump. She set a new personal record with a 43.050, which was good enough to move into the No. 9 spot on Georgia’s all-time top-10 list. She jumped into the top 16 in the nation as well, putting her in position to qualify for the NCAA indoor championships.“I was encouraged by Keturah’s performance, considering she was just training through this meet,” Kyprianou said.  “Aliyah also proved she is progressing and is getting close to joining us at Nationals.”Laine tied teammate Darius Carbin at No. 2 on Georgia’s all-time top-10 list in the high jump. He also moved into a tie at No. 3 on the national performance list with a 7-3.25 on his second attempt. It was his first event win as a Bulldog in his first season since transferring to Georgia.Carbin trained through the meet and did not compete following his win at the Razorback Invitational on Jan. 27.“Keenon has to have been our highlight after showing he belongs in the big leagues,” Kyprianou said.  “I am looking forward him challenging his Bulldog teammate at the NCAA meet.”Senior Alex Poursanidis finished second in the weight throw, marking the fourth time this year he has placed in the top two in the event.His second and third longest throws of his career won him the collegiate event, and he finished only behind Music City Mavericks’ Joe Frye.


 


“Alex is showing a consistency that we want to see as the postseason approaches,” Kyprianou said.Senior Asianna Covington ended in sixth place in the women’s weight throw with a season best 65-4.75. Freshman Beatrice Llano earned a career-best 62-11.50, placing her at No. 8 all-time at Georgia.Senior Tatiana Gusin won her second event of the year with a 5-10.50 in the high jump. It was her first event since competing at the Orange and Purple Classic on Jan. 7. Sophomore Mary Terry finished third with a jump of 5-7.75.Freshman Sam Drop recorded the fastest indoor time in the 5000 meters for the Georgia women’s team since 2012. She jumped to the No. 7 spot on the Georgia all-time top-10 list with a time of 16:33.57. Freshman teammate Yanely Gomez secured eighth place in the event.“I thought Sam ran a nice personal best and that is promising for her future,” Kyprianou said.Senior Sid Vaughn crossed the finish line at 14:21.98 to take fourth place in the men’s 5000 meters.Seniors Maurice Freeman and Reggie Glover both clinched top five finishes in the men’s 200 meters. Freeman finished third with a 21.60, and Glover ran a 21.87, good enough for fifth place.",Matthew Couper | Contributor,sports,https://www.redandblack.com/sports/georgia-track-starts-strong-at-music-city-challenge/article_c1d39f46-f074-11e6-9ef4-d3ea62c7e95f.html
14-Feb-17,Indoor athletic facility helps Georgia in multiple ways,"Georgia football is no longer an outlier in the Southeastern Conference. With the construction of the indoor athletic facility, which was dedicated on Tuesday, the Bulldogs now have an enclosed practice area, just like their league counterparts.“It's a special place, one of the most beautiful in the country,” head coach Kirby Smart said. “I think that speaks volumes to our commitment to athletics but also to football.” 


 


The project that cost $30.2 million features a full-sized field in a climate-controlled setting. There is a sound system that can be used to play crowd noise. The high ceilings, Smart said, set the facility apart from some of the older facilities he has seen and allow for indoor practice in the kicking game. Mostly, the building will provide relief from weather conditions that are not suitable for practice, whether that be sweltering Georgia heat in August, cold bowl practices in December or rainy days throughout the season.Previously in the case of inclement weather, Georgia’s team sometimes traveled an hour away to use the Atlanta Falcons’ facility. Now, a suitable alternative is available on campus.“Knowing in advance we have the ability to practice in a climate controlled environment will calm many nerves, relieve some angst and create less visits to the weather.com website,” athletic director Greg McGarity said during the dedication. “No more last-minute trips to Flowery Branch or missing precious practice time on game week.”

            }
        The facility was ready in time for the team to use during practices leading up to last season’s bowl game, but for the regular season, the team had to travel a few miles to the club sports fields. The new building, which was funded entirely through donations, is located adjacent to Butts-Mehre Heritage Hall and is in the same location as Georgia’s old outdoor fields and indoor turf room. McGarity said there had been plans for an indoor facility in the same spot since 1999. No space was gained inside the building, and Smart said the new outdoor practice areas will be ready to go for spring practice. 


 


For college football, the building of facilities has become an arms race of sorts, with schools such as Clemson adding areas with features such as miniature golf, a bowling alley and a barber shop. At Alabama, where Smart was the defensive coordinator until he joined Georgia’s staff last year, the indoor practice facility has a 130-yard field and includes cameras that hang from the ceiling. “I certainly think we're always playing a little bit of a catch up when it comes to the people in our conference,” Smart said. “A lot of the teams in the [SEC] West, obviously have had these venues.” When football coaches are trying to convince high schoolers to attend their school, these facilities could have swaying power. For Georgia, Smart said the new facility has “helped a lot in recruiting.”

“Mot of the guys we're recruiting had seen the progress throughout, but they hadn't seen the finished product,” Smart said. “When you see dirt and things getting moved around and poles, you never realized it could come to be this.” Other sports will be able to use the facility, as batting cages can lower from the ceiling for the baseball and softball teams and a 65-meter track and jumping pits also have a spot indoors. Still, the full-length field with a G painted in the middle is the primary spectacle on display. And it’s an amenity that the Georgia greats, whose photos decorate one wall, never got to experience. “One of my goals since arrival is to create an environment that our players have everything necessary to compete both on and off the field,” Smart said.",Emily Giambalvo | Senior Staff Writer,sports,https://www.redandblack.com/sports/indoor-athletic-facility-helps-georgia-in-multiple-ways/article_284a00a8-f318-11e6-9adc-1bfabe451cda.html
18-Feb-17,'To Spin a Yarn' exhibit brings historical tools to the Georgia Museum of Art,"An exhibit of artistic distaffs is on display at the Georgia Museum of Art now until April 16.“To Spin a Yarn: Distaffs, Folk Art and Material Culture” showcases distaffs used in the 19th and 20th centuries in countries across Europe such as Russia, Sweden and France. “I think the objects are surprisingly beautiful and interesting,” said the in-house curator Hillary Brown.


 


Distaffs were wooden tools used for spinning purposes, both with and without spinning wheels. They held the unspun fibers and prevented them from getting tangled in the remaining yarn or material being spun.Apart from household purposes, distaffs were treated as sentimental gifts as well.“They are like an engagement ring in some ways,” Brown said. “They’re fascinating, they’re beautiful and they have this connection to hand-made objects that is really interesting.”A man would carve, paint and decorate a distaff to then present to the woman he was courting for marriage in hopes that she would marry him. Several of the distaffs on display in this exhibit show symbols of love and virginity, such as hearts and locks. Some have dates and times painted on them, symbolizing when couples were married.“You tend to assume that women’s work was not particularly valued,” Brown said. “A good spinner [was] in high demand.”She explained that spinning was a part of women’s work during this time and a very individual craft that was valued highly by men and women alike.“This is a really important economic contribution to the household that women brought,” Brown said.The intricacy of the designs on the distaffs shows just how important the skill of spinning was to both men and women at the time.


 


“Decorated tools relating to spinning and weaving reference one of humanity’s earliest achievements […] while also recognizing and honoring one facet of the work performed by women on a daily basis,” said distaff collector, Michael Ricker. “Understanding such cultural tools is an important step to understanding culture.”Ricker, who has been collecting European distaffs for 15 years, explained that they had a wide variety of forms and decorations, even though they held a narrow purpose in the household.“Distaffs act as touchstones to our shared past,” Ricker said. “The clothing made from those spun fibers, which we take for granted today, was […] a primary measure of wealth. A single shirt would take as much as five miles of thread,each inch spun by hand, to weave.”This exhibit gives museum visitors insight to life before the Industrial Revolution and mass-production. Ricker’s distaffs on display show just how many leaps have been made in everyday life and technology.“Treasures are made of the [humblest] materials, such as distaffs and clothing,” Ricker said. “We should all work to expand the range of the treasures we admire.”While the wooden tools may appear to be very similar, their designs include intricate details of their origins. Russian distaffs, for example, are often made with only one piece of wood and have horses painted on them as well.  “They’re decorated with really interesting symbols,” Brown said.Some distaffs serve a more decorative purpose than others, especially those that are heavily carved. Although carvings weaken the distaffs for their main purpose, they simultaneously give them a beautiful decorative appearance.


TNCMS.AdManager.render({region: 'fixed-big-ad-bottom-asset', slot: 1, fold: ""below""});


“Every distaff honors the memory of its culture, its maker and its user,” Ricker said. “Every distaff has a story.”This exhibit is being borrowed from Stephen F. Austin State University in Nacogdoches, Texas.

19-Feb-17,Georgia's pattern of losing close games continues with Kentucky,"It would have been impossible for the end of Saturday’s game between Georgia and Kentucky to have been spoiled for fans.After all, no fan in attendance can see the future. The rowdy crowd in Stegeman Coliseum kept hope alive for the entire game that their team would be able to pull out the win.And yet, at the same time, fans likely had a bad feeling in their guts as to how this game would turn out. Sure enough, they were proven right.


 


For the fifth time this season, the Bulldogs lost a game that was decided by seven points or less. This latest version of Groundhog Day saw Georgia lead 75-73 with less than a minute left, only to eventually lose by a 82-77 score.“To be honest, any loss hurts,” junior forward Pape Diatta said. “We’re all a bunch of winners. Every time you lose, it just hurts.”While it wasn’t decided by seven points or less, this was the second time this season the Bulldogs have lost a close game to the Kentucky Wildcats. On Jan. 31 in Lexington, Georgia led by two with around 10 seconds to go. But a jumper from Kentucky’s Malik Monk sent the game into overtime, where the Wildcats dominated.Going back to last season, this loss makes it three straight bluegrass heartbreaks for Georgia. In the semifinals of last season’s SEC Tournament, the Bulldogs led Kentucky 62-54 with 13 minutes left. But Kentucky rallied and pulled away down the stretch to win 93-80.Frazier suffered an ankle injury in the second half of that game, and junior Bulldog forward Yante Maten played less than two minutes in Saturday’s game after suffering a knee injury. Frazier said the team has played well against the Wildcats, but it just hasn’t been enough.“Well two of the last three times we played them, one of our players got hurt,” Frazier said. “That’s just how the chips fall, man. It is what it is. You’ve got to live with it. I’ve got to say, in the last three times we played them, we played damn near perfect. You can’t beat that.”Frazier said this loss did not give him a sense of deja vu, and his head coach echoed the same thoughts. However, not everyone on the team responded the same way when asked about feelings of deja vu after yet another close loss.“Low-key, yeah,” Diatta said. “You can say that.”

21-Feb-17,"Cross-country bikers share dreams, explorations at BikeAthens","Most people would never dream of starting to bike across the country. However, for the four adventurers that visited BikeAthens on Sunday, traveling cross-country on two wheels is a check on the bucket-list.BikeAthens hosted a talk on Sunday, Feb. 19 so that people interested in biking could come and listen to speakers talk about their most adventurous experiences.The local organization has been helping to promote bike safety to the Athens community since the late ‘90s.


 


“We are a charitable organization working to make Athens more bike-friendly.” Tyler Dewey, executive director of BikeAthens said. “We do that through education advocacy and community service.”BikeAthens members talk to the government to promote bike friendly policies such as the implementation of more bike lanes. Dewey said that they also hold educational events similar to the BikeAthens talk, and they give bike safety training to kids. BikeAthens also helps people in poverty who need a mode of transportation. “We do community service through the bike recycling programs which takes donated bikes, fixes them up and gives them to low income members in the community who need a way to get to work and can’t buy a car,” Dewey said.Dewey picked the four speakers because of their diverse biking backgrounds and experiences.“These four speakers are all involved in the organization in some way, and we knew from working with them that they all had diverse experiences...” Dewey said. “I knew that these four each sort of had a specific skill set that complemented each other and sort of covered the whole spectrum of bike travel.”The four speakers were Laura Stone, Carmen Kuan, Carol Myers and Douglas Patton. They all had a unique story to tell.Laura Stone was the first to speak, and she said she started biking with her four siblings at an early age. 


 


 “We lived on a country road, so we just kind of had free reign to explore… and our parents didn’t worry too much about where we went,” Stone said.Stone said that her and her siblings’ main motivator for biking was the freedom that came along with it. “I think our motivation was just to escape, explore and be independent,” Stone said.Stone went on many bike rides, including three bike trips between Athens and North Carolina to visit family and one cross-country tour. She also rode from Oregon to Northern California twice, and has done many trips around North Georgia.Stone’s first long biking trip was from Charlotte, North Carolina, to her hometown, Gastonia, North Carolina to visit her family during Christmas. “It was only 20 or 30 miles, but it was a big challenge for me at that time, and it made me realize I could ride any distance that I wanted to if I prepared,” Stone said.Many of Stone’s trips since then have also been done solo, but she mentioned that she often runs into many bikers on the way.“Most of my trips, I have done by myself, or at least started by myself. On my cross-country trip, I met a lot of bike tourers and I rode with other people for short periods of time,” Stone said.

Carmen Kuan, a graduate from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, traveled in a group with an organization called Bike and Build.“Bike and Build is a non-profit organization that benefits affordable housing, so riders will apply to partake in this service-oriented cross-country trip,” Kuan said. “And if accepted, we are responsible to raise $4,500 dollars to go on the trip.”The money raised by each of the Bike and Build members goes for affordable housing grants.Kuan rode across the United States with Bike and Build. With this organization, she rode over 3,800 miles. It took her and her teammates about 10 weeks to complete.Food during the trip was provided by community hosts through Bike and Build.“Meals were often taco bars or pasta from Bike and Build. Breakfast and lunch were often leftovers,” Kuan said.Douglas Patton, an Athens resident for about 10 years, is a fanatic mountain biker. At the talk, Patton mentioned one time where he had given his wife a GPS bike tracker, so she would not worry about him. Then the bike tracker stopped working.

 “My wife stopped sleeping, and was about to start a search rescue for me,” Patton said.After Patton put in new batteries, he appeared again on the bike tracker.Patton has traveled across the country, and he likes to set up hammocks with a tarp over his head to sleep.“I will not stay in a camp site. I think they are really disgusting,” Patton said.He once saw a grizzly bear during one of his trips, and he was afraid it was going to attack him.“It didn’t even notice I was there,” Patton said.  Carol Myers, who grew up in Long Island, New York, but considers Athens to be her home, has always loved to bike. “I have never not had a bike,” Myers said.  

Myers learned how to bike when she was five-years-old, but she did not start biking long distances until after she retired at age 56.Myers has traveled across the country in addition to traveling across Sicily, Italy with her husband. During long bike routes, she says that she listens to podcasts so she doesn’t get bored.When Myers first started riding across the country, she mentioned that her mom was worried about her, but then her mom became a big inspiration.“My mom ended up being my biggest fan,” Myers said.Myers’ favorite biking adventures include traveling across the Northwest and Canada.The speakers said that some people express concern over the safety of biking such long distances. Kuan and Myers both said their bikes never had a flat tire during their cross-country travels, but Kuan mentioned that one of her teammates almost hurt her knees during the beginning of their trip.“One of my teammates almost blew out her knees because she didn’t have her bike fitted,” Kuan said. Myers advised bikers to pay attention to when they are tired on long trips and to fuel their bodies accordingly.

“Really listen to your body,” Myers said.These four speakers got the wheels in the audiences’ heads turning as the stories they shared were motivational enough to make one want to buy a new bike and helmet and start peddling towards their own adventure.",Julia Sanders | Contributor,culture,https://www.redandblack.com/culture/cross-country-bikers-share-dreams-explorations-at-bikeathens/article_c6913a94-f8a2-11e6-8407-2b055f95f532.html
22-Feb-17,OPINION: U.S. health food trends cause global problems,"Healthy eating is in fashion right now, especially amongst millennials who have been dubbed the foodie generation. Fad health foods constantly sweep the nation as the best way to improve your diet.There seems to be a confusing amount of information circulating about health foods, and no one knows which option is truly “right.” However, we should not just consider the impact that food has on our individual bodies. We must also consider the broader consequences of our dietary choices.Nearly half a million children as young as six harvest 25 percent of United States crops. An Atlantic article postulates that the reason for this is many children in poverty must work to help provide for their families.


 


Whenever a new superfood becomes popular in America, these workers face increased demand with no increase in pay. Quinoa and avocado serve as two examples of popular health foods that might be causing harm.In Bolivia, quinoa has historical and cultural significance to the natives there. They depend on the crop for nutrition. When the US promoted quinoa as a superfood, the market price tripled, making it more difficult for the Bolivians who produced quinoa to also consume it. This issue also sparks concerns for malnutrition and starvation for local Bolivians.Avocado is also problematic due to the sheer amount of water and land required to produce the crop. The US imports nearly 70 percent of its avocados from Chile, worsening droughts that wreak havoc. These droughts cause devastation not only for the farmers but also for the surrounding community as well.The fact is that the United States agriculture industry has deep ties with many other countries worldwide. Sometimes our interests and fads can cause change and trouble abroad for other agricultural workers. Increased need for certain vegetables or renowned superfoods can cause harm to local populations who produce the crop.We have to take humanity into consideration. It is important to assess all the facts and ensure that you act on what you believe to be most healthy for not only yourself but also people around the world. It isn’t as easy a choice as it seems.",Jaime Conlan | Staff Writer,opinion,https://www.redandblack.com/opinion/opinion-u-s-health-food-trends-cause-global-problems/article_cd9d7bee-f7b8-11e6-924f-5b95d5b5f7ca.html
23-Feb-17,Replacing the irreplaceable: How Georgia plans to make up for losing Yante Maten,"When Yante Maten, the Georgia men's basketball team’s leading scorer on the season, went down with a knee injury in the opening two minutes of last Saturday's game against the Kentucky Wildcats, head coach Mark Fox didn't need a doctor to know his star was hurt badly. “I could tell immediately that something was wrong,” Fox said. “I knew he wouldn’t be back. I could just tell.”  It’s the most recent of a series of tough breaks which have plagued Georgia all season long. Close losses have become a staple of the 2016-2017 Bulldogs, who have squandered leads in the final minute against ranked opponents on three occasions this year, including twice against Kentucky.   However, losing Maten poses an entirely different sort of challenge. Without him in the lineup, Fox is running out of options at the forward position.  Apart from Maten, Georgia’s roster includes three players who are six-foot-eight or taller: Derek Ogbeide, Mike Edwards and Houston Kessler.   Ogbeide has started all 27 contests the Bulldogs have played, and he will most likely have to take over as the leader in Georgia’s frontcourt. Ogbeide said the key to keeping the Bulldogs on track without Maten is to not try to make any drastic changes in his own game.  “Just do more of what I’ve been doing to higher effect,” he said.  As for Edwards and Kessler, neither have been major contributors on the team to this point in the year. Both players average less than five points per game, and the pair has combined for just one start the entire season.  But if Fox’s reaction to Maten’s injury on Saturday is anything to go by, Edwards is going to be seeing a lot more playing time down the stretch. He played 34 minutes against the Wildcats, easily a season high. He also scored 10 points, just one fewer than his high mark this year.  Edwards said he’s prepared to embrace the increased role he will have to play now that Maten is no longer capable of suiting up for the Bulldogs.  “Coach Fox said he’s counting on me to take on a bigger role,” Edwards said. “I’m ready to take on that challenge.”  Kessler, on the other hand, notched six minutes of playing time and did not score against the Wildcats.   The responsibility of manning Georgia’s frontcourt will therefore fall heavily on the shoulders of Ogbeide and Edwards. The duo held things down well enough against Kentucky, but Ogbeide’s foul trouble caused trouble for the Bulldogs late in the game.  For Georgia to transition smoothly into life without Maten, it cannot afford for either Ogbeide or Edwards rack up early fouls and spend large chunks of time on the bench.  “Those two kids did a nice job,” Fox said. “But we’ll have to be a little smarter, stay out of foul trouble and be very efficient with how we play.”

23-Feb-17,J.J. Frazier lifts Georgia to win over Alabama,"In Georgia’s first matchup against Alabama in Stegeman Coliseum on Jan. 25, the Crimson Tide handed the Bulldogs a loss in front of the home crowd in Athens. Thursday night in Coleman Coliseum, Georgia had an opportunity to return the favor, and it capitalized.   Senior guard J.J. Frazier picked up right where he left off, contributing 28 points after scoring 36 against Kentucky on Saturday. Georgia (16-12, 7-8 SEC) won its first full game without Yante Maten 60-55 over Alabama (16-11, 9-6 SEC).  The Bulldogs started the game out strong on offense, hitting on four of their first eight shots to begin the contest.   But the team’s defensive effort was even better.   Georgia defenders forced the Crimson Tide into missing 12 of their first 14 field goal attempts. At the first TV timeout, Alabama was shooting less than 15 percent from the field and had just four points over 10 minutes played.   But while the Crimson Tide players had difficulty getting into any sort of offensive rhythm, they did collect nine offensive rebounds in the opening 20 minutes. The team’s presence on the glass kept Georgia from completely running away with the game early.  Despite drawing double and sometimes triple teams from Alabama players, Frazier still managed to put in 11 points in the first half. The extra attention being paid to Georgia’s senior point guard opened up sophomore forward Derek Ogbeide for a couple of easy buckets, and the Bulldogs took a 30-18 lead into the halftime break.  Georgia held its comfortable lead through much of the early portion of the second half, but Alabama’s physical style of play began to wear on the Bulldogs as the game went on.    Crimson Tide players continued to pick up offensive rebounds and score in the paint, and by the 10 minute mark of the half it was back to a one possession contest.  The two teams continued to exchange baskets, with neither finding a way to pull away from its opponent. Each time Alabama scored off a possession extended by an offensive rebound, Frazier would come back and score to keep the Bulldogs on top.   And while the Crimson Tide had many opportunities to draw even in the game, Frazier refused to give it up. He scored 11 straight points from the 8:40 mark to when there were only 6.5 seconds to play. Alabama could not answer, as the senior guard carried Georgia to the road victory.

25-Feb-17,J.J. Frazier closes out game against LSU with four fouls and flu-like symptoms,"With 6:21 remaining in Georgia’s Saturday evening match-up against LSU, senior guard J.J. Frazier picked up his fourth foul when he hit LSU’s Antonio Blakeney on a 3-point attempt.At that point, there were a lot of reasons to take Frazier out of the game.First of all, it left him just one foul away from fouling out and being held off the court in the crucial final minutes of the game. Health was also an issue, as Frazier woke up with flu-like symptoms and spent much of his morning at an urgent care facility.


 


But while Georgia head coach Mark Fox admitted he considered pulling Frazier from the game at that point, he ultimately decided to leave his starting point guard on the floor. Frazier went on to score eight of the team’s final 13 points, including two free throws with 1.6 seconds left which gave Georgia the lead it would not give up.And while it will be the offensive achievements that Frazier’s performance will be remembered for, he wouldn’t have been on the court for the Bulldogs’ final possession without playing clean defense down the stretch.“He’s a smart guy,” junior guard Juwan Parker said. “He’s a four-year senior. He knows how to play defense with four fouls.”Fox said the only adjustment the team made when Frazier acquired his fourth foul was switching Frazier and sophomore guard Turtle Jackson’s defensive assignments.While Jackson had his own shifting role to think about, he said the thought of Frazier fouling out never even crossed his mind.“I wasn’t really worried about it at all,” Jackson said. “Guys were trying to attack him, but he’s a smart player. One of the best.”Fox was less certain about the decision. He said he gave a good amount of consideration to giving Frazier a rest for multiple reasons.But in the end he decided to do what he thought was right for both his team and the player that has carried it since Yante Maten was injured last Saturday.


 


“I figured J.J. Frazier would rather die on that court than not be out there trying to win,” Fox said. “So I left him in.”",Nathan Berg | Senior Staff Writer,sports,https://www.redandblack.com/sports/j-j-frazier-closes-out-game-against-lsu-with-four/article_5ccb551c-fbc8-11e6-8d15-df2f2c37734c.html
25-Feb-17,A 29-point performance from J.J. Frazier leads Georgia to 82-80 win over LSU,"Over the course of his career, senior Georgia guard J.J. Frazier has had a knack for hitting creative shots around the rim. In Thursday’s win against Alabama, Frazier hit numerous driving layups to carry the Georgia offense.But in Saturday’s game against Louisiana State University (9-19, 1-15 SEC), it was two of the simplest shots in basketball that made the difference.With Georgia (17-12, 8-8 SEC) trailing 80-79, Frazier was fouled going for a layup with just 1.6 seconds to go. He hit the first to tie the game, and he hit the second to put Georgia on top for good at 81-80.


 


“I know how hard he works and how many free throws he shoots every day, so I’m just sitting there knowing it’s going to go in,” sophomore guard Turtle Jackson said.Sophomore forward Derek Ogbeide intercepted LSU’s full-court pass and hit one-of-two free throws, sealing the 82-80 win for Georgia.After scoring 36 and 28 in his last two games, Frazier, who was playing through an illness that Fox said required a trip to the doctor Saturday morning, once again led the team with 29 points. 18 of those points came in the second half as his team fought off numerous rallies from LSU.The Bulldogs showed early they were not fatigued from Thursday night’s game. After trading blows with the Tigers early, Georgia went on a 21-5 run, capped off by a pair of 3-pointers from freshman guard Tyree Crump. Crump’s shots gave Georgia a 33-16 advantage with 8:14 left in the first half.Junior guard Juwan Parker the early run was very beneficial to the team’s mindset early on.“It definitely helps your confidence, especially when guys are being aggressive, hitting shots,” Parker said. “It makes the game more fun. It lets you know maybe we can score a little bit, but obviously we didn’t play as good of defense.”On the brink of being run out of the gym, the Tigers did not fold, a theme that was constant throughout the game. They went on an 8-0 run of their own to stop the bleeding, and they went on to outscore Georgia 21-11 the rest of the half to cut the deficit to only 44-37 at halftime.Five different Bulldogs scored at least six points in the first half, led by Frazier with 11.


 


After LSU hit a 3-pointer to draw within four points, Jackson hit a pair of 3-pointers to put Georgia back up 50-40 with 18:11 to play.The Tigers responded once again, however, using a 17-8 run to draw to within one point with 12:23 remaining in the game.“LSU is a very good offensive team and they wore us down,” Fox said. “We could not get stops or rebounds in the second half.”Like he has in the past two games, Frazier then took over. He scored Georgia’s next five points, and then he assisted on an alley-oop to sophomore forward E’Torrion Wilridge up 65-59.However, when Frazier fouled LSU sophomore Antonio Blakeney on a 3-pointer with 6:21 left, Blakeney made 2 of his free throws to once again tie the game at 69.Frazier scored five of Georgia’s next seven points as the Bulldogs built back a 77-71 lead. But like they did all game, the Tigers fought back. With 1:28 remaining, a putback from freshman Tiger Wayde Sims put the Tigers on top for the first time since it was 9-7, 78-77.Georgia had one last chance for the win, having to go the length of the court in 6.7 seconds while trailing 80-79. According to Parker, the play was a simple one.“Get J.J. the ball,” Parker said. “Let him make a play.”

Frazier took the inbounds pass and made a beeline straight for the basket. He went for one of his patented layups, but he had to settle for the simple free throws. His 17th and 18 instead to give Georgia its second straight win. After leading the team to a win at Alabama with 17 second-half points, his 17th and 18th points of Saturday’s second half gave the Bulldogs the victory.“He’s just such a great competitor,” Fox said. “At the moment of truth, great competitors are usually at their best. J.J. was that late, again.”",Jed May | Assistant Sports Editor,sports,https://www.redandblack.com/sports/a--point-performance-from-j-j-frazier-leads-georgia/article_bb8f0022-fbbd-11e6-98d1-f7887091e4ca.html
3-Mar-17,University Health Center hosts 'Safe Spring Break' event,"The University Health Center hosted its annual “Safe Spring Break” event in the Tate Student Center today as part of its #BeWellUGA campaign. This was the first year that the event was hosted in the Tate Student Center.With spring break quickly approaching, the health center wanted to remind students to be smart and safe during their travels. UHC student groups and specialty clinics, such as Healthy Dawg Ambassadors and RSVP (Relationship and Sexual Violence Prevention), set up multiple stations to encourage positive decisions and behavior among UGA students.“We’re here to promote good health and good choices for a time when college students tend to make not so great decisions,” said Jennifer Tran, a junior health promotions major from Atlanta and member of Healthy Dawg Ambassadors.


 


Students had the opportunity to visit each station, learning about vision and dental care, drug and alcohol awareness, body positivity and sexual education awareness. The stations also included games, free merchandise and other resources.“Spring break is fun, but it’s not fun when something like sexual assault or an alcohol-related incident occurs,” said Senior Communications Coordinator Kristine Groft. “We want to make sure students are well prepared and have good ideas about prevention.""Groft said she wants to raise awareness on bystander intervention, encouraging students to be active “WatchDawgs” during their spring break activities. A “WatchDawg” refers to a UGA student who takes an oath to watch out for fellow friends and intervene when presented with a potentially hazardous situation.“We want you to have fun, but have fun without losing sight of being smart,” Groft said.Even if students weren’t planning on engaging in any risky or dangerous behaviors over their spring break, they still received useful tips on skin care, nutrition, eyewear and dental hygiene.“The alcohol and drug tips may not apply to me directly, but I think it’s still good to learn about for my friends and others,” said Nana Boateng, a junior nutritional science major from Ghana.While topics of sexual education or alcohol are often talked about in private, students liked how open and honest the event was.“I like this event because it doesn’t make anything taboo. It is very out in the open, I can go to each of the stations at my own pace and I feel comfortable talking to the people working them,” said Nanditha Menon, a freshman international affairs and marketing major from the Canary Islands.

5-Mar-17,Column: Georgia track and field could perform better at NCAAs than SECs,"Georgia track and field has established itself as a program on the national radar. Former coach Wayne Norton and now Petros Kyprianou have made sure of that.The program has individual Southeastern Conference champions galore from as recently as last weekend at the SEC Indoor Championships, 15 Olympic athletes and coaches from the Rio Olympics and notches top 10 rankings weekly.But why no team hardware in the trophy case?


 


That’s the million dollar question, but a question that doesn’t worry Georgia’s head track coach at the moment.Sure, Kyprianou won’t sugarcoat it. He would’ve liked his teams to sweep the SEC championships last weekend, or at least performed better than their national rankings. The women, ranked No. 3 nationally going in, finished fourth at SECs, while the men, ranked No. 4, placed sixth.That’s like if an SEC football squad went 11-1 in the regular season and still fell in the SEC championship game. The 2012 Georgia Bulldogs would know something about that scenario.Thus is life in the SEC, for any sport.But Kyprianou is not naïve to the reasons why his teams didn’t take home team trophies at the SECs, and neither should Georgia fans.His program is still in the early stages of injecting life into a depleted group of runners. Of the 14 athletes that will travel to the NCAA Indoor Championships this week, only one — sprinter Kendal Williams — will compete in two of the five event categories that consists with running: sprints and distance.Kyprianou brought in assistants Ken Harnden and Devin West to steer Georgia’s runners in the right direction. Williams is a direct product of that shift, as the sophomore captain followed Harnden from Florida State and is competing in his first year.Williams shattered the school record in the 60 meters last month, and is an early indication of where Georgia’s runners may be headed.


 


In the meantime, though, Georgia will fall behind in team scores when its runners can’t keep the pace.That’s exactly what happened last weekend at SEC championships. As good as the Bulldogs are in the multi-events, throws and jumps, winning an SEC title requires proficiency in all five events.“We’re not an SEC [champion]-type team,” Kyprianou said. “But even though we’re not, we had some really, really good individual performances [at the SECs] … Even though we finished fourth and sixth, we could finish higher at the NCAAs.”Kyprianou is right. Whereas SEC Championships are limited to 14 schools and require great depth of talent across all events, the NCAA Championships expand to a much bigger field. That alone neutralizes the points depth can provide in conference championships.In simple terms, stars will shine at nationals. And if enough stars shine, the team secures a title.Case in point: the Georgia women placed third at NCAAs last year with only four athletes. This year, the team travels 14 athletes to NCAA Indoors with seven men and seven women apiece.For seniors like the brother-sister SEC champion duo of Devon and Kendell Williams, this will be their final shot at an indoor championship.“It would be amazing and historic if both those siblings go out and win the NCAA title,” Kyprianou said. “I can’t wait to see what they can do.”


TNCMS.AdManager.render({region: 'fixed-big-ad-bottom-asset', slot: 1, fold: ""below""});


Two programs, however, stand in the Bulldogs’ way with unworldly combinations of depth and talent. SEC champion Arkansas will bring Georgia’s team total alone on the men’s side, with 12 more women to boot. Oregon, with the No. 1 women’s team and No. 3 men’s squad, will travel 16 individuals and three relay teams as well.“We’re the little David going up against the big Goliath and Oregon and Arkansas, those are big, powerful schools,” Kyprianou said. “We’ll go there and we have seven bullets in our handgun and they [Oregon and Arkansas] got a million rounds in their machine gun.”No matter the size of those other dogs in the fight, Kyprianou isn’t backing down. He feels he has the best team in program history and the timing is right for a major victory.We’ll see next week if these ‘Dogs can hunt.",Kevin Mobley | Contributor,sports,https://www.redandblack.com/sports/column-georgia-track-and-field-could-perform-better-at-ncaas/article_5d44c462-01ac-11e7-a78d-e325307b5e84.html

“I have a brother and a sister who go to school in Georgia, so it was a natural decision to want to be near my family since I was leaving home,” Akinola said. “[UGA] was the best school that offered the program that I wanted, and I didn’t really apply anywhere else.”Chip Chambers, a sophomore Midterm Fellow from Watkinsville majoring in biology and economics, said he had always been interested in UGA. He tried to get the Fellowship as a senior in high school, but said he wasn’t get asked to interview for the scholarship.UGA did, however, award him the Center for Undergraduate Research Opportunities Honors Scholarship, which gives students a stipend for doing research. He considered about six other schools before deciding they did not offer anything that UGA couldn’t.“I grew up a dog fan, but my academics were really important to me, so I didn’t want to base my decision on the fact that we have a good football team,” Chambers said. “I looked around and decided that UGA and the Honors Program could give me what I wanted even without the Fellowship.”Maria “Izzy” Ceron, also a sophomore midterm fellow from Dacula majoring in international affairs and Latin American and Caribbean studies, did not apply for the Fellowship as a high school student. Instead, she applied and received the CURO Honors Scholarship.She considered attending Emory University, which offered her a scholarship, and Georgia Tech. Ultimately, though she was sold on UGA’s undergraduate research.“I went to the interview weekend and saw that through the support of CURO and the Honors Program, I was going to be able to pursue undergraduate research, and I decided to attend UGA,” Ceron said. “With everything that the Honors Program offers in terms of financial support and academic enrichment opportunities, it really made UGA stand out on the list of schools I was interested in.”She said that she believes the Fellowship has already begun to enhance her experience and future career goals.


 


“I want to work to increase political representation for the Latino community. The Fellowship has an incredible network of alumni that I feel like I can reach out to if I have questions about applying for a certain internship or grad school,” Ceron.Elizabeth Cagle, a freshman majoring in English from Madison, is the recipient of the Ramsey Scholarship. All high school seniors who get invited to interview for the Foundation Fellowship automatically receive the Ramsey Scholarship.“I couldn’t afford out of state tuition, so I was looking at in-state schools. I really wanted to come to UGA, but it was really expensive and I was not sure I’d be able to make it,” Cagle said. “Getting the scholarship is why I was able to come. Also, at the time I was not sure what I wanted to study, and UGA has great programs in lots of different areas.”She said that she has enjoyed the sense of community among Foundation Fellows and Ramsey Scholars.“I am going to be the first person in my family to try to get a Ph.D., so it’s nice to have a support group that knows how to do that because I don’t know how to,” Cagle said.Jessica Ho, a sophomore majoring in cellular biology from Augusta, started out as Ramsey Scholar, but was recently awarded the midterm Fellowship.Ho said she was initially torn between either going to an Ivy League school or a public university. In the end though, she was sold on UGA’s affordability.“[Getting the Ramsey Scholarship] was a huge factor,” Ho said.“Ultimately, knowing my future plans, I will be spending a lot more years and money [going to med school], so UGA made the most sense.”

Ho said her favorite part of being at UGA has been the balance between her school and personal life.“Since coming to college, I’ve been able to strike a nice balance in my life between having a solid emphasis on academics and my classes, but also having a healthy social life and going out with friends and going to football games and parties, but also take care of myself physically and emotionally,” Ho said.",Olivia Adams | Contributor,uganews,https://www.redandblack.com/uganews/ramsey-and-foundation-fellows-reflect-on-their-decision-to-attend/article_25d1ca66-01c5-11e7-8d8b-7782a75d9927.html
12-Mar-17,Chase Adkins salvages series for Georgia baseball,"In college baseball a Sunday starting pitcher can do one of three things: he can sweep a series, he can win a series or he can salvage a series.For Georgia baseball on Sunday afternoon, it was up to junior Chase Adkins to salvage the Bulldogs’ series with Rider.On Friday and Saturday, Georgia starting pitchers Kevin Smith and Tony Locey struggled to keep the Rider offense off the bases. Smith was pulled on Friday night after allowing six runs on five hits in the top of the first, while Locey was retired in the second inning on Saturday afternoon when the freshman gave up six runs on six hits.


 


However, going into Georgia’s final game with Rider on Sunday afternoon, Georgia head coach Scott Stricklin wasn’t worried about his Sunday starting pitcher. He said there was no conversation that needed to be had with Adkins before the game to prepare him.“You don’t need to say anything to Chase, just give him the ball,” Stricklin said. “He wants the baseball, he wants to compete every single day and we don’t worry about him. We know he is going to be ready to go and he certainly was today.”Adkins saw six innings worth of time on the mound, allowing just one run in the top of the first before settling in and recording five scoreless innings for Georgia. Adkins held the Broncs to just four hits, while striking out four.“[Adkins] really competes, he is a great competitor,” Stricklin said. “He is able to throw a lot of strikes with a lot of good pitches.”Both Stricklin and Adkins said keeping hitters uncomfortable is the junior right-hander’s game.“I like working backwards,” Adkins said. “[I like] making good pitches, mixing them up, and getting [hitters] off balance.”With Southeastern Conference play beginning in less than a week, Adkins’ pitching is one area of the Bulldogs’ game that Stricklin isn’t worried about.Adkins is now 3-0 as the Sunday starter this season and through his last 21 innings the junior has only given up one run.


 


“I have to just keep getting better,” Adkins said. “It’s a huge accomplishment anyways but each week I have to get better and better and keep helping the guys out.”",Tori McElhaney | Assistant Sports Editor,sports,https://www.redandblack.com/sports/chase-adkins-salvages-series-for-georgia-baseball/article_89433300-077e-11e7-93c1-1ffadda1caec.html
16-Mar-17,Reggie Davis hopes elite 40 time can open up NFL opportunities,"At this year’s NFL draft combine in Indianapolis, Indiana, Washington wide receiver John Ross III broke the all-time combine 40-yard dash record by posting a 4.22 time, two hundredths of a second faster than the mark Chris Johnson set back in 2008.Reggie Davis did not display quite that level of speed at Georgia’s pro day Wednesday, but his performance in the event certainly exceeded the expectations of most.According to walterfootball.com, Davis clocked in at 4.31, a mark which would have made him the third fastest runner at the combine this year. It would have tied him for fastest in the event in 2016 with former teammate Keith Marshall.


 


“I just wanted to come out here and kill the 40,” Davis said. “I feel like I did a good job on that.”And while the quick time may come as a surprise to those on the outside, Davis said it was right around where he planned on running.While training for his pro day at Bommarito Performance Systems in Davie, Florida, Davis said his fastest attempt at the 40-yard dash was a 4.29. It was a result he planned on at least replicating and hopefully exceeding when NFL scouts were watching on March 15.With his impressive time, Davis carries on a recent tradition of speedy athletes coming out of Georgia. In addition to Marshall’s combine-leading time last year, wide receiver Chris Conley’s 4.35 was the fourth best mark at the 2015 combine.Running back Todd Gurley never ran a 40-yard dash at the combine as he was recovering from a knee injury in 2015, but he was an elite sprinter in high school, finishing second in 100-meter dash in the 2A state track meet for North Carolina in 2011.To this point in the draft process, Davis has not been drawing as much attention from professional programs as his similarly fast peers. Gurley was a 10th overall draft pick. Conley was a third round selection while Marshall was taken in the seventh.According to nfldraftscout.com, Davis is ranked as the 152nd best receiver in this year’s class. With only 33 receivers being drafted last year, Davis is not expected to hear his name called in Philadelphia this April.During his four year college career, Davis never exceeded 300 yards receiving in a season and only caught two touchdowns.


 


But Davis said he hopes his elite straight-away speed will move him in the right direction on NFL general managers' draft boards. Davis’ reasoning for why professional teams should consider him in late April was simple, yet convincing.“Speed kills,” he said.",Nathan Berg | Senior Staff Writer,sports,https://www.redandblack.com/sports/reggie-davis-hopes-elite-time-can-open-up-nfl-opportunities/article_2052a99a-0a60-11e7-ad66-db0a3d53dc53.html
19-Mar-17,Georgia track and field teams begin outdoor season at Georgia Tech,"The Georgia track and field team began its outdoor season on Friday at Georgia Tech after the team posted second and fourth place finishes at the NCAA Indoor Championships last week.The team sent 49 athletes to Georgia Tech’s Yellow Jacket Invitational. Of the 14 who competed at NCAA Indoors, only two -- men’s throwers Denzel Comenentia and Alex Poursanidis -- competed again at the meet. NCAA champions Kendell Williams, Keturah Orji, Devon Williams and Mady Fagan, along with eight other teammates, took the weekend off.Poursanidis and Comenentia went toe-to-toe in the first competition of the meet: the hammer throw. Poursanidis edged out his teammate with a throw of 204 feet, 11 inches to win the event. Comenentia followed up with a win of his own in the discus toss.


 


Georgia’s runners, which head coach Petros Kyprianou noted is an area for growth following his team’s best combined finish in an NCAA championship, recorded some high marks on Friday.Freshman Jessica Drop ran away with a win in the 1,500 meters on account of a 4:27.73 time. Junior Bryan Kamau countered Drop’s win with a win of his own in the event, notching a time of 3:52.16. Junior Devon Artis also won the 800 meters for the Georgia women, while senior Maurice Freeman took home a win in the 400.To wrap up the meet, Georgia’s relay teams started off their outdoor season with wins in three of the four relay events.Freeman, Jonathan Raines, Reggie Glover and Gabe Blackman ran a 40.6 in the 4x100 relay event to win. Both of the Bulldogs’ 4x400 meter relay teams notched victories to cap off the meet.",Kevin Mobley | Contributor,sports,https://www.redandblack.com/sports/georgia-track-and-field-teams-begin-outdoor-season-at-georgia/article_ce5bc9c6-0cb9-11e7-90bc-e780fa7e345a.html
23-Mar-17,Deangelo Gibbs and Richard LeCounte making early impression,"When Jacob Eason lined up for the first set of 11-on-11 drills Thursday in Georgia’s second spring practice of the year, there was a new face looking back at him on the other side of the line of scrimmage.Deangelo Gibbs has not been in Athens for long, but in his first week of official collegiate football activities, Gibbs is already getting work in with the first-team defense.“He's a good, talented kid,” junior defensive back Deandre Baker said. “He works hard every play.”


 


Gibbs was not the only newcomer getting in on the action Thursday. Later in the practice period, fellow early-enrollee Richard LeCounte III grabbed an interception off junior quarterback Sam Vaughn, and he likely would have taken it all the way back if the play had come in a real game.Although the two newest members of the secondary have not had long to get acclimated to playing at the next level, Baker said they’ve already made leaps and bounds of progress.“They’re freshmen, but they’re picking up plays fast,” Baker said. “Working hard just like they’ve been here for three years. They got a bright future.”Senior defensive tackle John Atkins said he didn’t get a good chance to watch the young players work in 11-on-11s as he was focused on his own play, but the glimpses he did see, he liked.Atkins also made particular note of how much added speed and energy the new guys bring to the practice field.“I got to make my body keep up with them,” he said. “Cause they’re moving.”And it wasn’t just their bodies that have gone fast since arriving in Athens. Atkins said particularly of LeCounte that it was the young player’s mouth that never stops working.“When he first came here it was like he’d been here for three years almost the way he came in,” Atkins said. “He was just talkative.”


 


As it stands now, it’s much too early to predict what kind of impact Gibbs and LeCounte will make in their first seasons playing for the Bulldogs, but the two newest members of Georgia’s secondary have already made impressions on their teammates.And while first-team reps in March don’t always transfer to playing time come fall, senior linebacker Davin Bellamy said experience is not going to earn anyone a job over talent.“If a guy’s ready to play, coach is not going to be hesitant,” he said.",Nathan Berg | Senior Staff Writer,sports,https://www.redandblack.com/sports/deangelo-gibbs-and-richard-lecounte-making-early-impression/article_5cb8f1e0-102e-11e7-9b40-43f5f1fa0eab.html
30-Mar-17,Campus carry gets a second chance: House Bill 280 makes its way through the Georgia General Assembly with mixed support,"With the final day of the Georgia General Assembly session fast approaching, legislators don’t have much time to get the campus carry bill onto Gov. Nathan Deal’s desk.House Bill 280, which is back in the House for re-approval after passing through both chambers this month, is the newest in a long line of Georgia bills pushing to allow weapons permit holders to carry on campus.Under the bill, weapons permit holders 21 years or older would be allowed to carry everywhere on campus, except for in student housing, Greek houses, sporting venues and daycare centers.


 


The latter exemption comes as a result of concerns Gov. Nathan Deal raised about a similar bill, House Bill 859, last year.A Senate Judiciary substitute also adds buildings specifically intended for high school classes as another exception.Outside of the two exceptions, the bill is effectively the same as HB 859 last year, which Deal ultimately vetoed following state-wide protests.A threat to personal safetyThere are those who disagree with Sager, however. On March 21, close to 75 students and Athens locals gathered at the University of Georgia Arch last week to voice their opposition.Mallory Harris, a junior computational biology and math major from Dunwoody, helped organize the rally after speaking out against HB 859 last year.For her, guns on college campuses pose a threat to personal safety.“This bill was pushed under the guise of protecting a victim,” Harris said. “The reality is, that’s not how sexual assault happens.”


 


Following the bill passing the House floor, Rep. Rick Jasperse (R-Jasper), a co-sponsor of the bill, said the bill is about victims.“I think, in the end after all it’s said and done, is ‘Do you force people to be victims?’ That’s all it’s about,” he said.Paul Oshinski notably spoke out against HB 859 last year, testifying to the Senate Judiciary committee and starting a Change.org petition that amassed over 7,300 signatures.In his petition, Oshinski said Chief of UGA Police Jimmy Williamson, along with other campus police chiefs in the state, opposed the campus carry bill in 2013, arguing it “inhibited their job of keeping campuses safe.” University Police declined to comment on pending legislation.This year, Oshinski has continued his opposition this year, working with Harris to organize the rally at the Arch.The junior political science major from Decatur said his opposition to the bill derives from how he feels it will affect education and free speech.“We talk about tense issues, polarizing topics in class every single day,” he said. “So the idea of having someone next to me with a gun is kind of outrageous. To me, it inhibits my free speech.”The idea of campus carry remains unpopular among UGA students and faculty.In a non-scientific online poll of roughly 400 UGA students conducted by The Red & Black last year, close to two-thirds of respondents were opposed to concealed carry on campus. The numbers mirror results from a self-selected survey of over 650 students conducted by UGA’s Student Government Association this year and The Red & Black/GLOBIS survey of over 4,100 students and faculty members in late 2016.


TNCMS.AdManager.render({region: 'fixed-big-ad-bottom-asset', slot: 1, fold: ""below""});


Protecting personal freedomDespite protests, there are those who stand behind campus carry.For Keely Larsen, a supporter of the bill, the right to protect herself is key.The thought of being a victim is one Keely Larsen thinks about every time she walks to her car at night.“On campus, I don’t really have a means of protecting myself, so I try not to go to places by myself,” Larsen said.Larsen is a second year medical student at August University’s Athens campus and said she carries concealed when she is off campus.She said she feels the idea of concealed carry offers female students a sense of protection from sexual assault.“For me, the focus of the right to defend yourself, for females, is on being able to protect myself and the empowerment to do so,” she said.

In order to do so, Larsen said she feels she should have a choice to carry.“My main concern is that we’re telling women, in a time where rape culture is evident, that self defense is a one-size-fits-all solution and it’s not,” she said.Larsen’s husband, Dallin Larsen, is also concerned about campus safety.For the doctoral Hispanic linguistics student from Edmond, Oklahoma, campus shootings are a matter of when, not if.Because of this, Dallin feels responsible to protect not just himself, but those he teaches as a teaching assistant.“When I’m teaching, I have been given these 60 students that I’m suppose to look over and mentor,” he said. “If something happens, I’m all of a sudden not trusted to protect them? To me, there’s a disconnect.”Having taken courses on how to use a concealed weapon, Larsen said he would feel confident in his skills should a situation arise.“In that training, we go over the responsibility that it is, as soon as you pull a trigger and a bullet comes out, you are responsible for where that bullet goes,” he said.

While he sees personal safety and defense against campus shooters as important, Dylan Sager ultimately sees the proposed legislation as a restoration of constitutional rights.“Why should we ban people from a common right?” the senior psychology major from Perrysburg, New York, said. “I think it’s completely ridiculous.”Sager said he believes the current ban merely exposes colleges as a “gaping vulnerability” for those looking to inflict damage by mass shooting.“It’s always in the back of your head. How bad would you feel if you could have stopped something like that, and you weren’t carrying?” he said.Looking at TexasAlexander Chase has heard both sides of the campus carry argument before when a similar piece of campus carry legislation went into effect in Texas earlier this school year.It was only after Texas Senate Bill 11 passed through the state legislature in the summer of 2015 that students at the University of Texas at Austin spoke out.“Students really only got involved once it became clear to them that was the reality, rather than taking the effort to go fight it before it happened,” said Chase, who serves as editor-in-chief of The Daily Texan at UT-Austin.

Chase said as the law went into effect in August 2016, discussion and protest about the implementation of campus carry heated up, including a nationally covered “Campus Dildo Protest Rally,” where students carried sex toys in place of concealed weapons.Chase said there has been some academic fallout from the legislation, with two notable professors leaving the school following the legislation.“The dean of our architecture school explicitly said she left over that,” he said. “I’ve been contacted by a student or two who say they’ve turned the school down because they were worried about campus carry.”Many professors have signs telling students to ask about their gun policy during office hours, Chase said. Others have “Gun Free UT” signs hanging in their windows.“A lot of the TAs have office hours in shared spaces, and they’re not allowed to ban guns there, so a lot have resorted to holding their office hours in bars near campus where Texas law prohibits firearms,” he said.However, almost a full year into campus carry, Chase said there have been no openly visible negative effects.“We haven’t had any incidents where somebody’s flashed a gun and try to intimidate anyone that we’ve heard of,” he said. “We haven’t really felt the impact that those who were against the bill talked about in terms of direct dangers.”Without any incidents, Chase said he sees “more of a social discussion and the ongoing effects of that discussion rather than any impact of the guns themselves.”

“Because nothing’s happening, it’s hard to have a consistent conversation about it,” he said. “Without incidents, I feel it probably has slipped from a lot of students’ minds at this point.”Bets on the bill’s futureHB 280 passed the Georgia House at the beginning of March 108-63 and passed by substitute through the Senate on Tuesday by a 32-22 vote.Despite opposition from Georgia officials, the bill now goes back to the House for re-approval following the Senate Judiciary substitute, and potentially the governor’s desk should it pass Thursday.Included in the opposition is University System of Georgia Chancellor Steven Wrigley, who testified against the bill when it was in the House.“With respect to campus carry, we feel strongly current law strikes the right balance to provide security on our campuses,” Wrigley told legislators. “We therefore respectfully oppose any change to current law.”University of Georgia President Jere Morehead later endorsed Wrigley’s testimony in an Archnews statement.Others sources of opposition are more surprising. Georgia U.S. Senator Johnny Isakson has expressed opposition to the bill during a town hall earlier this month.

Oshinski said he sees Isakson’s statement as a step in the right direction.“I think [Isakson’s statement] would be a good message to Gov. Deal that it’s not really a partisan issue,” Oshinski said.While many supporters feel Deal will sign the bill this time around, and opponents feel he will stand behind his veto statement last year, the governor has not indicated how he will act if the bill reaches him.“We’re receptive to continuing to talk with [legislators], and hopefully they’re receptive to making some additional changes,” Deal told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution after HB 280 passed the House. “Perhaps. But whether they do or don’t, that’s their decision.”",Nate Harris | Senior Staff Writer,athensnews,https://www.redandblack.com/athensnews/campus-carry-gets-a-second-chance-house-bill-makes-its/article_2b211b62-14d9-11e7-8f7e-1f6f27eda326.html
31-Mar-17,Throwers and distance runners lead Georgia on first day of Texas Relays,"The Georgia track and field teams began their final meet on Thursday at the Texas Relays ahead of next week's four-day Spec Towns Invitational.The Bulldogs opened day one of the meet hosted by the University of Texas - Austin with another strong outing from their throwers, with solid marks by distance runners as well.Sophomore Denzel Comenentia jumped into the No. 2 spot nationally with a hammer throw of 233 feet, 8 inches, a personal best for the indoor nationals qualifier and Georgia's best hammer throw since 2002.


 


Senior Alex Poursanidis proved again to be Georgia's second punch in the hammer with a throw one inch shy of Comenentia's mark to solidify the third best throw nationally thus far in the outdoors season.On the women's side, freshman Beatrice Llano also recorded a top three mark in the country on the day on her fifth attempt, a throw of 218 feet, 4 inches. Senior Asianna Covington complemented her teammate with a personal best of 198 feet, 3 inches.Georgia's distance runners also notched some history of their own at the Texas Relays. Sophomore Jeramey Hampton recorded a personal best and No. 3 national performance in the 800 meters, while Sid Vaughn and Bryan Kamau each raced to wins of their own in the 5000 meters and 1500 meters, respectively.Tomorrow, the team welcomes the addition of senior Cejhae Greene back to the lineup.

6-Apr-17,The sibling sweep: Kendell and Devon Williams find NCAA success together,"History started with a hurdle.Blane Williams wasn’t sure if his two young track runners could handle jumping over a hurdle, but he had them try anyway. Any sign of timidness might be a bad sign, but they had to add the hurdles for any shot at becoming multi-event athletes.Devon, Blane’s eldest son, was 11 at the time, and Kendell, the younger daughter, was 9. Both passed the test.


 


“The first thing my dad says whenever he’s teaching someone how to hurdle is, ‘Jump over it however you want’,” Kendell said. “With Devon and I, we never had that initial fear. We just went and jumped over the hurdle.”That day proved to be one small leap of many for the Williams siblings. More than a decade later, the Williams completed a first-ever NCAA track and field “sibling sweep” on March 11. Kendell secured her fourth-straight pentathlon title, while Devon earned his first title in the heptathlon.“It sounds like a movie ending,” Kendell said. “It means so much because we made history.”Different pacesNot everything was a simple sprint, though. Two weeks after Blane taught Devon how to hurdle, the coach tried his son out in the event at a meet.“He fell on the last hurdle and crawled across the finish line,” Blane said.Devon bounced back to win the national championship in the junior pentathlon that year at 11 years old. “A little-known factoid,” Blane said.At Kell High School, Devon won two individual state titles and led the Longhorns to a state championship. He signed with Georgia and its energetic multi-events assistant coach, Petros Kyprianou.

“Petros was really the coach that I needed coming out of high school,” Devon said. “I had a pretty strong foundation from my dad and my high school coaches, but Petros is a real technical coach, and that’s one thing I needed to sharpen up on: my technique.”As Devon made his way toward college in 2012, Kendell burst onto the scene with the U.S. Juniors team. First, she set a new U.S. girls junior record in the heptathlon and earned Athlete of the Meet with a fourth place finish at the 2012 World Junior Championships.She was named the 2013 Gatorade National Track Athlete of the Year. Devon said he knew he needed his younger sister with him in Athens.“Being here a year before her, I was able to experience how Petros works, how his practices go and my own progression,” Devon said. “So I knew if I could progress in a year as much as I did, she would also.”Kendell joined Devon at Georgia in 2013 after his freshman campaign, in which he placed third in the decathlon at SEC outdoors. But when the Williams traveled to the Junior Pan American Games in August of that year, Devon fractured his hip while Kendell earned a silver medal.Devon re-aggravated the injury at the second meet of 2014, just as Kendell set the new American junior record in the pentathlon. Devon opted to redshirt that year. Kendell surged to the 2014 NCAA Indoor and Outdoor titles as a freshman.“It was hard because the whole reason why I came here was for us to have the success together,” Kendell said. “That part wasn’t fun for me because I wanted to see him excelling on the track as well.”


TNCMS.AdManager.render({region: 'fixed-big-ad-bottom-asset', slot: 1, fold: ""below""});


By the beginning of the 2016 season, Kendell had three national titles to her name. Devon was finally healthy and looking for his first.Then, the redshirt junior tripped on the first hurdle at SEC indoors, forcing him to retire and barring him from nationals qualifying.“It was devastating,” Blane said. “I don’t think he’s fallen over a hurdle like that since he was 11.”The race was the epitome of the first four years of Devon’s collegiate career, but he never surrendered to doubt.“I’m actually really more impressed as a father with him being able to go through all that adversity that he went through, the injuries and the bad luck,” Blane said. “A lot of kids would give up.”Jumping into historyThe Williams siblings returned with plans for a tour de force in their final collegiate seasons. They were just getting warmed up with a sweep of the SEC Indoor Championships on February 25.The two entered the NCAA Indoor Championships on March 10-11 with almost opposite mindsets. Kendell looked to guard herself from complacency in the pursuit of a fourth-straight indoors title, while Devon desperately needed to rewrite his story from the year before.

Kendell rocketed out to a fast start first with a personal best time of 8.03 seconds in the 60 meter hurdles. The next event, however, put her potentially historic win in jeopardy.She scratched on a 5 foot, 11.25 inch jump that was well within her range, settling for a 5 foot, 10 inch mark. She walked over to Kyprianou in disbelief.“She’s never said ‘I screwed up’ to me ever, but she said, ‘I screwed up,’” Kyprianou said. “You don’t see these kids take responsibility like that. In my 25 years of being around sports, I’ve never seen anybody at that caliber come and say that.”Kyprianou then told Kendell to become “best friends” with the shot put, and that’s exactly what she did. On her first attempt, she launched a shot more than 42.5 feet to secure a win in the event, then placed top three in the next two events to complete her four-year sweep of the national title.“At no point was I worried she would pull it off,” Kyprianou said.Meanwhile, Devon began the final event, the 1,000 meters, down 224 points to Kentucky’s Tim Duckworth. Kyprianou walked over to Devon with a game plan: times to shoot for, scores to win. The senior captain stopped his coach.“Don’t put numbers in my head,” Devon told Petros. “I’m just gonna go run.”

Devon finished with a time of 2 minutes, 41 seconds while Duckworth came in later at 3 minutes and 4 seconds. With such a wide margin entering the race, the title was all but a foregone conclusion for Devon’s SEC foe.

“I remember crossing the line and the announcer even said as [Duckworth] finished, ‘Here comes the new 2017 NCAA champion.’ I don’t think the announcer knew that I even had the chance to win,” Devon said.Fate had a different idea. Devon’s fifth place finish in the 1,000 meters at nearly 23 seconds faster than Duckworth gave Devon 6,177 total points.In the 1,000 meters, each second counts as 12 points.Duckworth finished with 6,165. Thus, Devon won his first NCAA title by one second.“Not being at that meet last year made me hungrier,” Devon said. “I just ran for as long as I could, as hard as I could. I didn’t have anything at the end.”With the win, Devon secured the sibling sweep for him and his sister—the first event sweep by siblings ever recorded in NCAA track and field history as the Georgia women placed second and the men fourth.

“Sibling sweep rolls off the tongue nicely,” Devon said. “And I like that because that’s not really a comparison between us. That’s more of an uplift of both of us.”One last hurdleWith the i’s dotted on a historic 2017 indoors season for both the Williams and the Georgia track and field teams, Kendell and Devon have now set their sights on their final leg of the collegiate race: outdoors season.“Staying healthy is a big part,” Devon said. “Also, a lot of guys that aren’t good indoors are good outdoors because they’re better throwers … But we’re better at outdoors also so we’re looking forward to the challenge.”The Williams siblings open up outdoors season when Georgia hosts the Bulldog Heptathlon/Decathlon April 8-9, the first meet including multi-events in this year’s campaign.The final lap for collegiate championships starts in May with the SEC Outdoor Championships. The NCAA East Preliminaries begin two weeks later in Lexington, Kentucky.

If they qualify, the Williams will then make the trip to Eugene, Oregon, for their final meet: NCAA Outdoors on June 7-10.

“Ultimately, if I do my best in each event, the points and the place will take care of itself, and then for Devon same thing,” Kendell said.Both plan to pursue professional careers with USA Track and Field after graduation and will set their sights on the World Championships in London.The ultimate goal is for Kendell to return in 2020 to the Tokyo Olympics with Devon alongside her. Kendell believes another sibling sweep at the highest level of competition might not be out of reach.“I think it’s possible because we’ll both be young and in our prime,” Kendell said. “Our first goal is just both us getting there, and then I think our next goal will be, ‘OK, let’s both take the gold.’”",Kevin Mobely | Contributor,sports,https://www.redandblack.com/sports/the-sibling-sweep-kendell-and-devon-williams-find-ncaa-success/article_968c791e-1a5b-11e7-a799-fbc391d1ed6a.html
7-Apr-17,Alex Poursanidis leads Georgia track and field in the hammer throw at Spec Towns Invitational,"Senior Alex Poursanidis won the men’s hammer throw at the Spec Towns Invitational in Athens on Friday. This marks the final collegiate competition in which Poursanidis will compete at the Spec Towns track.Poursanidis followed his personal-best throw of 233-7 feet at last weekend’s Texas Relays with a throw of 224-11 feet to win the event.Junior teammate Alex Larsson had a top throw of 200-6 feet to take fourth place in the event.


 


“Alex has been very fired up about this meet,” head coach Petros Kyprianou said. “In general, being a Georgia Bulldog, and this year being a captain, he wants to lead being an example to everybody and push everyone around him.”Combined with sophomore Denzel Comenentia, a scratch from Friday’s event, the two athletes will look to carry the men’s throwing events going forward in outdoor postseason competition.“He’s a consistent guy, and everytime he throws over 68 or 69 meters, for him is really good,” Kyprianou said. “He’s got to be consistent, so hopefully down the road in Oregon, that’s where we’ll need the big marks.”All competitors battled windy conditions in the hammer throw on Friday, throwing from the cage directly into the wind.“I hate the wind, I felt a little pushed in the ring,” Poursanidis said. “I barely even threw today, just tried to save throws and not foul out, so I was surprised that it still went far, close to my personal-record.”For the women’s hammer throw, freshman Beatrice Llano followed her own personal-best throw of 218-4 feet at the Texas Relays with a throw of 218-0 feet on her second attempt to secure second place in the event.Senior Asiana Covington captured fourth with a throw of 186-1 feet, while sophomore Hayden Merrick finished sixth with a mark of 168-5 feet.“I think they responded really well,” Kyprianou said. “Even though it's home and it’s more comfortable, it's encouraging when they do well against bad conditions. It could have been worse, but they competed very well.”

8-Apr-17,New program provides small loans for downtown businesses in need,"In its March 14 meeting, the Athens Downtown Development Authority approved a small loan program of up to $10,000 for businesses that fall within the downtown district.This district includes many but not all of the businesses downtown.“The boundaries include what you would traditionally think of as downtown but have recently included the area around the Bottleworks on Prince Avenue,” Director of ADDA Planning and Outreach David Lynn said.


 


There will be a loan fee of five percent, and the loan can be paid back in eight quarterly payments over a two-year period with no penalty, Lynn said.“It’s a pretty good deal,” Lynn said.The program was proposed and subsequently approved now, as opposed to, say, months or years ago, because “The board wanted to do more to assist and to retain existing businesses downtown,” Lynn said.This new loan program was approved five weeks after legislation was adopted in Athens to impose a moratorium on new bars and apartments from forming.“I don't think the moratorium will have much effect on the loan program. For one, the moratorium will sunset in a year and two, [and] the spirit of the loan program is to support existing businesses,” Lynn said. “The moratorium only prohibits new bars and multi family development.”Loretta Paluck, member of the ADDA Board of Directors, knows firsthand the toll unexpected expenses can have on small business.Paluck previously owned 283 Bar in Athens for 13 years, and a clothing store, Dynamite Clothing, in Athens for 15 years.“I’ve heard people… [who] have an ice machine go out, and they’ll need help getting the ice machine fixed,” Paluck said. “It’s just a quick loan to help you get through that one little glitch in your business.”


 


Although Sanni Baumgaertner, owner of Community, a downtown boutique, has not had financial emergencies in her six and a half years of owning a business, she thinks the ADDA program is a beneficial fallback.“I think generally I would probably just dip into a credit card to do [repairs], but it would probably be a better rate to do it through [the ADDA],” Baumgaertner said. “I don’t think I would get a loan to make an improvement or to buy new equipment. I think it would be more of an emergency situation [such as] if all our sewing machines broke, and then that would be great to have that help available.”The money for the loans will come from ADDA’s funds, which come from 20 percent of Athens parking program and a one percent tax on property owners in the downtown district, Lynn said.Frank Eberhart, owner of the downtown Marvin’s Shoe Service, said he questioned the practicality of the ADDA using its funds for the loans.“A lot of times these businesses come in here, spending $10,000... and go broke in a year,” Eberhart said. “That’s something [the ADDA] might lose out on. Six months and [new businesses] close down.”Eberhart’s family business opened in September 1977 and was first owned by his dad Marvin. He said he has seen businesses come and go.“We’re set in our ways. We don’t depend on any of the stuff that’s offered downtown,” Eberhart said. “Thank goodness we’ve been busy enough to keep us going through the years.”So far, ADDA has not received any applications for the loan program, but it has been approved and is being advertised in newsletters and promotional packages.

8-Apr-17,Georgia distance runners show promise at Spec Towns Invitational,"In an area that has been a struggle for Georgia over recent years, the Bulldogs delivered several strong performances on Saturday that offer hope for the future.Georgia earned it's first sweep of the weekend early Saturday morning in the 5000m at the Spec Towns Invitational.Junior Hailey Branch began the day with a new personal-record in the women’s 5000m with a time of 17:15.59 to take first in the event. Branch crossed the finish line ten seconds ahead of South Carolina senior Mary Reiser.


 


Redshirt freshman Stephen Martinez followed followed suit, also setting a new personal-record with a time of 14:54.37 to complete the 5000m sweep for the Bulldogs.Georgia distance running has been an up and down section of the team over the years, but the success of all the distance athletes, for head coach Petros Kyprianou, is “a testament to the whole process.”The Bulldogs secured their second sweep of the meet later in the afternoon with the 1500m.Freshman Jessica Drop jumped to the 7th spot all-time at Georgia in the outdoor race with a time of 4:22.37. Two freshmen Bulldog teammates finished soon after, with Yanely Gomez logging a time of 4:31.11 to come in second, and a time of 4:33.22 for third place finisher Sam Drop.“[Jessica] we knew coming out of high school was very underrated, but Coach Cuniff did a very good job identifying that talent, and we got her,” Kyprianou said. “She went from 4:27 to 4:22 by herself basically, and she’s done a tremendous job there.”Georgia recorded another 1-2 finish in the men’s 1500m, with junior Bryan Kamau crossing the line in 3:45.60 to take over the 6th spot all-time at Georgia. Senior teammate Sid Vaughn followed close behind Kamau and took second in the race with a time of 3:49.98.“It was awesome, I’ve never heard so many people cheering,” Kamau said. “The pacers did a great job, all I had to do was just push.”After being a weak point on the team for years, the distance athletes are finally putting together some momentum, and the recent results could ultimately put the team on a path to long term success sooner rather than later.


 


“It just shows the work we’ve been doing and the progress we’ve made,” Kamau said. “As long as you trust the process and trust Coach, [success] just keeps coming.”",Matthew Couper | Contributor,sports,https://www.redandblack.com/sports/georgia-distance-runners-show-promise-at-spec-towns-invitational/article_77a38b60-1cc6-11e7-a1e0-4789349cb847.html
9-Apr-17,Georgia jumpers show room for improvement at Spec Towns Invitational,"In the high jump, junior Mady Fagan skied over the bar at 6-1.25 feet to tie her outdoor personal record and take first place at the Spec Towns Invitational on Saturday.Fagan, the 2017 NCAA Indoor National Champion, had yet to compete in the outdoor season for the Bulldogs. She quickly returned to her winning ways, and she will now look to make adjustments on the road to the outdoor Southeastern Conference and NCAA championships.“It was OK, but I’m definitely not satisfied,” Fagan said. “I have a lot to work on with my approach, and I think that’s what I learned from today. I had similar issues when I first opened up indoors, so I just need to get it worked out.”


 


Sophomore transfer Keenon Laine and freshman Darius Carbin both made their outdoor debuts for Georgia on Saturday.Laine tied for fourth place with a jump of 6-11 feet in his first action since finishing third at the 2017 NCAA Indoor Championships. Carbin locked up a tie for second with a leap of 7-1 feet.“That one I didn’t like,” head coach Petros Kyprianou said. “For the guys, I was not happy. Those guys need to learn how to compete better. They’re young, they’re learning, I’m learning with them, so we’ve just got to keep grinding.”The high jump was a key event to the success of the Bulldogs in the indoor season, and the outdoor season should be no different. All high jump athletes, including senior Tatiana Gusin, will be crucial to the overall team standings for both the men and women heading towards postseason competition.Opening the season at the Spec Towns Invitational was beneficial to the athletes, specifically in the high jump. Having the crowd support during the middle of the meet helped all the athletes feel the excitement for the whole team.“This crowd was amazing, I was super happy for the turnout,” Fagan said. “I’ve had people coming up to me and talking to me and asking me for advice, it’s been really cool. Petros is most responsible for getting the whole community behind us, and that means a lot.”",Matthew Couper | Contributor,sports,https://www.redandblack.com/sports/georgia-jumpers-show-room-for-improvement-at-spec-towns-invitational/article_1344e6ac-1cce-11e7-b6ee-835b0ef13e6c.html
11-Apr-17,Piedmont Athens Regional relaunches mammogram mobile,"Piedmont Athens Regional wants to make sure every woman who is eligible for a mammogram has no problem obtaining one.With the reintroduction of the medical center’s mobile mammography unit, the hospital hopes to reach women who need to undergo a mammogram but find it is too far out of the way.Sporting a fresh coat of bright pink paint to support breast cancer awareness, this transportable extension of the clinic aims to provide an efficient process for breast screening for women in Oconee, Barrow, Madison and Jackson counties.


 


The unit is said to have “the absolute best technology available,” according to Connie Phelps, the director of Piedmont Athens Regional Breast Health Center.“The new three-dimensional imaging unit decreases the number of patients called back for additional imaging and increases the ability for early detection of breast cancer,” Phelps said in a press release.The technology, purchased in 2004 through Piedmont’s employee giving program, works to provide the breast imaging that is comprehensive enough to catch virtually any early signs of breast cancer.According to the American Cancer Society, this technology, also referred to as breast tomosynthesis, “reduce false positives and detect slightly more invasive cancers compared to digital mammography alone.” By examining each tissue of the breast individually, doctors are given a high quality image of the breast interior. With this, they are able to look more closely for early signs of cancer developing.Approximately one in eight women, 12 percent of the female population, will develop invasive breast cancer during their lifetime, according to ACS. These statistics, which were posted in 2015, predicted that over 246,660 new cases of invasive breast cancer would be diagnosed in 2016.Though mammograms do have some limitations, the American Cancer Society said, “mammography is the single most effective method of early detection since it can often identify cancer several years before physical symptoms develop.”The technology in the mobile unit is only half of the appeal, however. With this unit being fully situated in a moving vehicle, Piedmont Athens Regional is ensuring mammograms are available and convenient for all eligible women in the area.Organizations can request for the mobile unit to visit them at any school, business or community event. The unit’s presence is free, and the only cost is the price of the mammogram itself. When the mobile unit is not visiting a local area upon request, it can be found at predetermined sites throughout the week.


 


The first Thursday of each month, the unit will be carrying out appointments at Regional FirstCare Barrow from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. The second and fourth Wednesday of every month from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m., the unit will be located at Regional FirstCare in Jackson and on the second Tuesday from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m., the unit will be parked at the Bell’s Food Store in Watkinsville.Any women ages 40 or older are eligible to receive a mammogram within the unit, provided they are not pregnant and have not received a mammogram within the last year.Upon entering the vehicle, women will undergo the mammogram process with a registered female technologist. The process takes approximately 30 minutes in all, allowing for the unit to administer up to 20 mammograms per day.With breast cancer technology evolving every year, the medical center is passionate about continuing to decrease the number of women affected by breast cancer. Phelps said in the press release that she is focused on helping women by “detecting cancers earlier and improving outcomes.”",Kaley Lefevre,athensnews,https://www.redandblack.com/athensnews/piedmont-athens-regional-relaunches-mammogram-mobile/article_69df404a-1e52-11e7-a39d-6b6c01920f92.html
12-Apr-17,Oxford comma causes confusion within campus carry bill,"A grammatical discrepancy could decide whether Gov. Nathan Deal signs or vetoes a bill looking to allow guns on college campuses.House Bill 280 passed the Georgia General Assembly shortly after midnight March 31 on the final day of the legislative session. The bill would allow weapons carry permit holders to conceal carry firearms everywhere on campus, with exceptions for student and Greek housing, sporting venues and daycare centers. A final version of the bill, written by a joint conference committee only a few hours before it passed both the House and the Senate, also introduced a few new exceptions in an attempt to please Gov. Deal, who vetoed a similar bill last year.One of the concerns Deal raised last year was the lack of exception for administrative offices on campus. One of the last-minute exceptions looks to appease that concern, stating that the law shall ""not apply to faculty, staff, or administrative offices or rooms where disciplinary proceedings are conducted.""


 


However, a writer for GeorgiaPol.com has raised the concern about that sentence can and should be interpreted.The sentence can actually be interpreted three ways.Under one interpretation, it could apply to three separate things; it could not apply to faculty members, not apply to staff members, and not apply to administrative offices or rooms where disciplinary hearing are conducted.Under another interpretation, it could apply to two separate things; it could not apply to faculty offices, staff offices, or administrative offices, and not apply to rooms where disciplinary proceedings are conducted. The offices would be exempt regardless if disciplinary hearings are conducted there.Under a third interpretation, it could apply to only one thing; it could not apply to faculty offices or rooms, staff offices or rooms, or administrative offices or rooms where disciplinary hearings are conducted. The offices and rooms would be exempt only if disciplinary hearings are conducted there.""This is one of those things were it depends on what the author is trying to say,"" said Robby Nadler, the assistant director of the UGA Writing Center.Though some have advocated for the first interpretation, Nadler said it ""seems odd,"" due to the Oxford comma, the use of which in series differs depending on what writing style to which an organization subscribes.""We have to read the sentence as if the sentence is aware of Oxford commas, since there is already one present,"" he said, referring to the comma after ""staff.""


 


It is unclear what the Georgia legislature's stance on the Oxford comma is. While the User's Guide in the Official Code of Georgia Annotated does not mention rules regarding the Oxford comma, the text in the guide itself appears to utilize it.For Nadler, the first grammatical interpretation raises questions.""Why is it not just 'not apply to faculty, staff, administrative offices, or rooms where disciplinary hearings are conducted,'"" he said. ""That reading would not make sense on the basis that the writer knows how to use the Oxford comma. So I would take that one out.""The second and third interpretations, however, are a bit more ""slippery,"" he said.""This could easily be 'faculty, staff, or administrative offices' as one thing it doesn't apply to, and 'rooms where disciplinary hearings are conducted' as another thing,"" Nadler said. ""Or it's trying to say it doesn't apply to 'these types of rooms and offices where disciplinary hearings are conducted.'""Between the two, Nadler said the latter is the best interpretation when nit-picking the grammar.""I'm tempted to read this as one item instead of two, because you would put in the prepositional 'to,' 'doesn't not apply to X or to Y,' if you wanted to have two separate items,"" he said, referring to putting a 'to' before 'rooms.'Under that interpretation, faculty, staff and administrative offices would be exempt, and rooms where disciplinary hearings are conducted would be exempt.


TNCMS.AdManager.render({region: 'fixed-big-ad-bottom-asset', slot: 1, fold: ""below""});


Nadler said the confusion is understandable. The ""to"" often gets informally dropped, because it's implied to be read as one item, he said.""Theoretically, just putting in the conjunction 'or,' it's just furthering the item,"" he said. ""It hasn't indicated that there's a separate one.""Athens-area Senator Frank Ginn (R-Danielsville), who was involved in the conference committee which drew up the final version of the bill, said he interpreted the sentence to mean two separate items.""You can't have one in a faculty office, you can't have one in a staff office, you can't have one in an administrative office, and you can't have one in a room where disciplinary proceedings are going on,"" he said.Ginn said phrasing of legislation is generally handled by the General Assembly legislative counsel.""Legislative counsel is a very large group of attorneys, and they do a very good job of formatting the legislation so that it can be entered into our Georgia code,"" he said.Ginn said the counsel was involved in the conference committee discussion when the final version of the bill was drafted, and that attorneys will continue to analyze it.""Attorneys are going to read into this six different ways to Sunday.""

The legislative counsel could not be reached for comment.In the end, Nadler suggests lawmakers could make their intentions clear by adding a second 'to.'""I would be inclined to read this as one thing, 'any location where disciplinary proceedings are conducted,'"" he said. ""It's really small, but if it wants to be two different things, it would need to be structured as 'not apply to this or to that.'""Gov. Deal has not commented on the matter.",Nate Harris | Senior Staff Writer,athensnews,https://www.redandblack.com/athensnews/oxford-comma-causes-confusion-within-campus-carry-bill/article_f2292ee0-1f22-11e7-a2fb-2fb78ae4ce8d.html

18-Apr-17,Athens Nurses Clinic offers free treatment to low income patients,"Treating people has been a passion for Paige Cummings since childhood when she would watch her father treat patients who were unable to afford healthcare. Her passion prompted her to join the Navy as a nurse, and later get involved with Athens Nurses Clinic to continue providing care for people in need.“My father told me it was our responsibility to take care of people that didn’t have the means to take care of themselves,” said Cummings, executive director of the clinic. “So after my time as a nurse in the Navy when I moved back to Georgia, I was volunteering at this clinic.”Athens Nurses Clinic is coming into the 27th year of treating people without health insurance with an income at or below 138 percent of Federal Policy Guidelines for household size at no cost. The clinic funded primarily by Piedmont Athens Regional Hospital as it alleviates the amount of people coming into the Emergency Room, as well as individual donors and some federal grants.


 


“One of the functions we serve is to keep people who don’t need to be going to the ER for non-emergent care from going to the ER,” Cummings said. “Emergency Room visits are really expensive, and if you don’t have money or insurance it’s a write off and a loss to the hospitals.”However Cummings said the primary purpose for the clinic is not financial, but rather to provide patients with the opportunity to form a relationship with a consistent health care provider, learn more about their health care and have access to the medication they need.“80 percent of the people getting prescriptions from the ER don’t ever go and get them filled,” Cummings said. “The doctors and nurse practitioners and everyone in the ER is wonderful, it’s just not the right setting for primary care.”Nurse Practitioner Erin Sullivan said the clinic is a great resource for the community because it allows the to spend more time with individual patients.“Education is a huge part of what we do for our patients to help them know what they can do differently in their lives,” Sullivan said. “We don’t have access to every medication, so we have to hit the problems from all angles.”Offering dental care, treatment for type one and type two diabetes, treatment for hepatitis C and also regular check ups, Cummings said the clinic is able to provide for patients just about everything that a typical family practice doctor would.The dental team is made up of five dentists, three dental hygienists and also students learning dentistry at Athens Technical College.“We have a team of wonderful volunteer dentists that offer a dental clinic, and during the school year Athens Tech’s school of dental hygiene sends a team out on Wednesday and they perform dental hygiene and cleaning teeth on our patients,” Cummings said.


 


Sullivan said a large amount of the clinic’s effort is put into educating patients on how to treat and prevent illnesses, including“We don’t have a way of giving physical therapy, so we have to try to teach them things they can do for themselves,” Sullivan said. “A lot of diet counseling, getting good exercise, it’s very important.”The clinic has an outreach team that goes to various locations in Athens to try and reach people that either have not heard about the free clinic, or are unable to get to the main facility. Cummings said one of the best places they do health screenings is the Athens-Clarke County Library.“A lot of the homeless hang out in the library during the day because the two homeless shelters close,” Cummings said. “But we go there, we go to Our Daily Bread, we go to Pinewood Library and different church functions.”Annabella Uhde, translator and office administrator at the clinic, said she works with Spanish-speaking patients during the treatment process, as well as gives nutritional education particularly to prevent and treat diabetes.“Most of patients, the hispanics, I would say 95 percent are Mexican, so their base nutrition is carbohydrates,” Uhde said. “So we give them a book, a glucometer, we give them everything they need.”The clinic is hosting a fundraising event ""Tomatoes at Terrapin"" on July 15 of 2017 at Terrapin Beer Company. Cummings said there will be tomato sandwiches and other food and activities.“The fundraiser is to provide for the clinic, and whatever new project,” Cummings said. “One year it was to update our dental equipment, and sometimes it’s just so we can expand the services to more people.”

Cummings said things like staying open two hours longer than normal hours can become an expensive task.“If you stay open two more hours there’s more costs that just to keep the facility open,” Cummings said. “You have to pay for staff, and maybe four more patients come in and you have to do four more labs- it all adds up to more than you’d think.”Cummings said Athens Nurses Clinic hopes to reach as many people as possible, and hopes more people in need are able to access their services.“We’ve been doing this for 27 years and still have people saying ‘I didn’t know we had a free clinic in Athens’,” Cummings said. “We just want people in Athens-Clarke County to be aware that there is a free clinic, and we’re happy to help because we feel if the individual gets healthier, then the whole community get healthier.”",Amy Scott | Staff Writer,athensnews,https://www.redandblack.com/athensnews/athens-nurses-clinic-offers-free-treatment-to-low-income-patients/article_73bf7278-23f3-11e7-b83f-ab0a1b733eba.html
20-Apr-17,Georgia’s Brandie Jay adjusting to life after retirement,"Former NCAA vault champion Brandie Jay considers herself a humble person despite being one of the most successful gymnasts in Georgia Bulldog history.“I didn’t really love the spotlight, but I loved competing,” Jay said. “It wasn’t for the people. It was for being able to show off my hard work.”Retirement is in full swing for the 23-year-old from Fort Collins, Colorado. She’s a year removed from graduating with her bachelor’s degree and halfway through completing a master’s degree in sport management and policy.


 


Jay is also fully immersed in a different role for the Georgia gymnastics program as the team’s graduate coach.With her first season as the team’s graduate coach at an end — Georgia finished sixth in its respective NCAA gymnastics championships semifinal — it is up in the air whether coaching is still something Jay wants to pursue.What’s in a title?It’s a broad title: “graduate coach.""The all-time leader for Georgia on the floor exercise, Jay now spends her days in the gym helping with equipment, coordinating apparel for the meets and directing the communications aspect of the Bulldogs’ new community outreach program Gymdogs Reaching Our World (G.R.O.W.).At meets, an onlooker might spot Jay and think she’s a part of the team because of her athletic attire, but those outfits are suited for a purpose.“I move all the mats,"" Jay said. ""I know everybody’s settings by heart for any event.""Coaching gymnastics is something Jay has considered as a career path for many years, but when she accepted the coaching job for her former team, she wasn’t expecting the medley of duties that came with it.


 


Even for a modest woman, it’s taken Jay some time to become acclimated in her position.“I got in this role, and I’m like, ‘Ouch, this kind of really sucks,’” Jay said. “It’s literally been from the top of the totem pole to the bottom.”Testing the watersThis past year has been one of the toughest years of growth for Jay.She’s had to learn on-the-go in her position. She’s had her patience tested from time to time.“She never sought [the spotlight], but she was so good that it was there and she handled it really well,” Goergia head coach Danna Durante said. “When that [thrill of competing], accomplishing things, gets taken away, and now your role is so behind the scenes, sometimes it feels thankless.”Jay was vocal as a Georgia gymnast. It’s a quality she can’t necessarily carry over to her new role. Coaches must strategize and train their gymnasts to be able to self-correct because coaches have a more distant role at meets.“I’m just trying to figure out where they need help, and where they need to struggle and figure it out on their own,” Jay said.

Her efforts do not go unnoticed, though. Junior Hayley Sanders, Jay’s close friend, sees the impact her remaining presence has had on the team.“She’s always giving us good tips on how to handle certain situations or just to help us let loose a little bit if we get nervous,” Sanders said.Driving towards sunsetJay’s fiancé, Zack Dorminey, 23, thinks she will continue to give coaching a shot, even if her first year might not have turned out exactly how she planned.The consensus from her teammates, coaches, friends and fiancé is if Jay were to leave the world of coaching, she’d find a job involving animals.She volunteers regularly at different organizations around Athens that are geared towards animals, including at Oconee Regional Humane Society.When Jay and Dorminey wed this summer on Sunset Beach, just off the coast of St. Petersburg, Florida, their dogs, Ruckus and Corra, will make the trip.“She wanted Ruckus to be the ring bearer,” Dorminey said. “He was going to, but we decided we’d let my little brother do it now.”

Despite her love for animals, Jay’s passion for helping others seems to be keeping her on the coaching track for the near future, unless she can find a way to combine the two.“I’m still trying to figure everything out,” Jay said. “I’m going wherever the wind blows me because there’s nothing set in stone.”",Patricia Duffy | Contributor,sports,https://www.redandblack.com/sports/georgia-s-brandie-jay-adjusting-to-life-after-retirement/article_b4cbf570-254c-11e7-9be7-b35c0ffc1d5f.html
24-Apr-17,Georgia track and field opens Virginia Challenge with top 10 NCAA outdoor marks,"Georgia track and field began the Virginia Challenge, the team's first meet including throwers and jumpers since the Spec Towns Invitational two weeks prior, with three new NCAA top 10 outdoor marks on Friday.The Bulldog men's throws duo of senior Alex Poursanidis and sophomore Denzel Comenentia each improved their nationally-ranked marks in the hammer throw and shot put, respectively.Poursanidis leapfrogged Comenentia nationally in the hammer throw with a new personal record hammer throw of 235 feet, 10 inches, good for the No. 2 mark in the country this year and Georgia's best since 2002.


 


Later, Comenentia moved up the top 10 ranks in the shot put with a 66 foot, 8.5 inch throw that moved him to No. 4 in NCAA competition this year. The sophomore also won his section of the hammer throw with a 227 foot, 3 inch mark, the second best throw of his season.Sophomore Aliyah Johnson emerged as a national triple jump competitor alongside teammate and 2016 Olympian Keturah Orji, as Johnson skied to a 43 foot, 8.5 inch jump that put her at No. 7 in school history and No. 9 in collegiate marks this season.In her 100 meters debut, Kate Hall raced out to the fastest collegiate time by a freshman in 2017 with an 11.36 second race to win and earn the No. 20 spot nationally as well.

26-Apr-17,Students gather at the Arch to protest campus carry,"Close to 30 University of Georgia students and Athens community members rallied at the UGA Arch in protest of the recent campus carry legislation.Mallory Harris, a junior from Dunwoody majoring in mathematics and computational biology, said this event made the third rally she organized against campus carry.Protest participants waved signs urging passersby to contact Governor Deal and encourage him to veto the legislation. Throughout the rally, protesters chanted slogans such as “ain’t nothing scarier than an armed Georgia fan” and “keep the G gun free.”


 


Harris said it was important to contact Governor Deal because his office is keeping a tally of support on both sides.About ten participants including representatives from Athens for Everyone and Moms Demand Action spoke in front of the crowd to voice their reasons for opposition.“We are here again for the second year in a row fighting the same terrible legislation,” Adam Lassila, a UGA alumnus and activist for Athens for Everyone, said. “We are out here to pressure [Governor Deal to veto the legislation] and call attention to the thousands of UGA students, faculty and staff who have signed letters saying they oppose this and who have spoken up at countless rallies both this year and last year.”Many protesters said they worried what effect guns on campus would have on the classroom“A lot of my friends who are teachers at UGA say that campus carry is a real threat to discussion and learning in the classroom because if you are teaching sensitive material and feel threatened, it may affect what is able to be discussed and taught. The implications of [passing campus carry] move in a lot of different directions,” Hannah Fenster, a graduate student studying comparative literature from Richmond, VA, said.Ivan Ingermann, a UGA professor, spoke at the protest.“The majority of Georgians, faculty, students and staff associated with the University System is against this bill,” Ingermann said. “It’s being sponsored by outside money from the NRA, so it is not like a needs basis where we at the faculty or institution level asked for this to be allowed.”The other professor who spoke, Richard Winfield, said gun deaths outweigh self-defense arguments.


 


“I think it is important to recognize that no matter what happens with this bill, there is a much broader problem involving the proliferation of guns throughout the United States,” Winfield said. ""[Of all the deaths involving guns] very few are killing armed intruders.”",Olivia Adams | Contributor,uganews,https://www.redandblack.com/uganews/students-gather-at-the-arch-to-protest-campus-carry/article_b7a742fc-2ada-11e7-ac9b-9f5db717f332.html
30-Apr-17,Urban students discuss easy transition to UGA,"A defining characteristic of a city is public transportation, such as MARTA or Athens Transit. Atlanta, however, is more urban than Athens, so students at the University of Georgia who grew up in Atlanta are used to the hustle and bustle a city brings.Atlanta’s total population from 2016 was 420,000 people, compared to Athens’ 116,000. Growing up in a metropolitan area with over three times the number of people than Athens, Hayes Buchanan knows firsthand what a city that size has to offer.Buchanan, a senior graphic design major from Buckhead, said, “[One] advantage [living in Atlanta] is that you get to see and interact with a much different group of people than you’re used to. MARTA is a great little melting pot.”


 


To him, MARTA’s characteristics are more positive than one might think.“[There are] people going home from construction working jobs all the way to executives… and they’re all on one train together,"" he said. ""Sometimes it’s loud, and sometimes it’s smelly, and sometimes it smells like weed.”Emma Mathews, a freshman theater and accounting major, grew up in Atlanta as well. First she lived in the Druid Hills area, and then when she was 16 years old, her family moved just right outside of Midtown.“At that point I could drive, so I started getting out and exploring the city more,” Mathews said. “That had a huge impact on my enjoyment of living in Atlanta.”Loganville, just 30 minutes northeast of Atlanta and although considered metro-Atlanta, is more like Athens than Atlanta, said Kimarah Laurent, a junior mathematics major from Loganville.Laurent didn’t have trouble transitioning from her high school in Gwinnett County to UGA because Loganville is “very similar to Athens.”Ashley Buda, a junior journalism major from Gwinnett County, lives just 30 minutes outside of Atlanta as well. For her, Athens is more of a hustle-and-bustle setting than her hometown, although suburban.“It’s different from Athens. Not nearly as much going on or things to do [in Gwinnett County.]” Buda said.


 


However, her graduating class was over 700 students, so the size of UGA’s population was not daunting to her.Buda said, “Just the sheer size of my class of 750, I wasn’t shocked by the amount of people at UGA.”Although some students from a suburban hometown see Athens as more city-like, those who grew up in the heart of Atlanta feel differently.Mathews said both places have interesting people, but Athens and Atlanta are more different than similar.“One of the biggest adjustments is the relative lack of diversity in Athens. It’s a whole lot of white people, which is weird coming out of Atlanta, which is not,” Mathews said. “It’s so strange driving on the loop [in Athens] and being on a farm all of a sudden.”Buchanan agrees.“The biggest difference between Athens and Atlanta is that there’s more diversity and more variety [in Atlanta],” he said.",Ashley Soriano | Staff Writer,uganews,https://www.redandblack.com/uganews/urban-students-discuss-easy-transition-to-uga/article_cf5124e2-2c72-11e7-b3e4-a79015bf1554.html
1-May-17,"Head 'shave-a-thon' raises more than $2,500 for childhood cancer research","Joe MacKenzie, a senior mass media arts major from Lawrenceville, organized a St. Baldrick’s Foundation head shaving event on Sunday afternoon, Apr. 30, at The Rook & Pawn.Seven people volunteered to have their heads shaven by members of Model Citizen Salon and donated proceeds to the charity, which funds childhood cancer research.MacKenzie said he decided to organize the event in honor of his late cousin, Pierce Broe. Broe died in Oct. 2014 after a 15 month battle with a brain tumor at only 12 years old.


 


St. Baldrick’s was the primary charity that aided Broe throughout his battle with cancer.“I organized this event because this is the charity that helped out my cousin, who unfortunately passed away from cancer a few years ago, and why we chose this one charity specifically is because they fund to childhood charity research,” MacKenzie said.According to the American Cancer Society, less than one percent of all cancer diagnoses each year are in children.MacKenzie said that he believes that we should bring more awareness about childhood cancer and address the need to research genetic cancers.“Childhood cancer is not very well addressed to the general or pharmaceutical population which means they need more money for specific research,” MacKenzie said. “Children suffer from specific genetic cancers. For example, the [type of cancer] my cousin had, a brain tumor, was not very well researched.”Tom MacKenzie, father of Joe MacKenzie, was one of the seven who volunteered to have his head shaved. He said he participated in memory of “his little fishing buddy, Pierce.”“I had taught him to catch his very first fish. We always try to help out kids with cancer because it just doesn’t seem fair,” MacKenzie said. “We also are happy to support our son, [Joe], who really was Pierce’s good buddy.”MacKenzie said the event is beneficial to educate the youth in the Athens community.


 


“I think it’s a great educational opportunity for a lot of the youth just like my son and daughter. Unless you have a personal acquaintance with cancer, you don’t know about this sort of stuff,” MacKenzie said. “I think it’s a great way to reach out to people and say ‘hey’ and give people a sense of giving early on.”Athens local, Bryan Carver, was the first to get his head shaved Sunday afternoon. He said he decided to participate in honor of his mother-in-law and a family friend who recently lost battles to cancer.“My mother-in-law passed away from cancer a while ago, and [my son] did bake sales and stuff to help,” Carver said. “Then, [my wife’s] friend passed away recently also.”Carver said he had heard about the event through friends who had participated in St. Baldrick’s events in Savannah.Throughout the event, 10 percent of all purchases made at The Rook & Pawn contributed to the Mackenzie’s St. Baldrick’s team named ‘Pierce the Heart.’ Their goal was set at $2,000. By the end of the event, the team had reached more than $2,500 from individual contributions and proceeds from purchases made at The Rook & Pawn.",Ashlyn Webb | Staff Writer,athensnews,https://www.redandblack.com/athensnews/head-shave-a-thon-raises-more-than-for-childhood-cancer/article_1a529a2c-2e1a-11e7-b735-b3d70520c57c.html

4-May-17,BREAKING: Gov. Deal signs campus carry bill into law,"Gov. Nathan Deal has signed a bill allowing guns on college campuses.After sounding positive about the most recent attempt by Georgia legislators to permit weapons carry license holders to conceal carry firearms on college campuses, Deal has signed House Bill 280 into law.HB 280 made it to the governor's desk after passing both the House and the Senate after a rewrite on the final day of the legislative session at the end of March.


 


Under the law, any license holder 21 years or older will be able to carry virtually everywhere on campus, with a few notable exceptions. Those exceptions include student and Greek housing, property used for sporting events, preschool or childcare property, rooms used for ""a college and career academy or other specialized school,"" room used for classes in which high school students are enrolled, or ""faculty, staff, or administrative offices or rooms where disciplinary proceedings are conducted.""Many of the exceptions were added in the final version of the bill as a way to appease Gov. Deal, whose concerns about high school dual enrollment and daycare facilities were part of the reason for his veto of a similar bill last year.However, in addition to confusion regarding the grammatical interpretation of the final exception, the bill has received criticism from parties on both sides.Many proponents of campus carry argued the bill was too restrictive in its exceptions. The final version of the bill lost a handful of supporters in the House during its final vote as a result.Several Athens area representatives, including Rep. Regina Quick (R-Athens), Rep. Spencer Frye (D-Athens), Rep. Chuck Williams (R-Watkinsville) and Sen. Bill Cowsert (R-Athens) voted against the final version of the bill for varying reasons. Quick expressed concerns with the ""unclear exceptions"" in the bill, while Cowsert said his vote was based on feedback from his constituents.Meanwhile, those opposed to the bill held rallies and demonstrations across the state, with several college representatives speaking out against the bill. University System of Georgia Chancellor Steven Wrigley testified against the bill in the House and Senate committees, with University of Georgia President Jere Morehead endorsing Wrigley's stance.The Faculty Senate of UGA's Franklin College of Arts and Sciences publicly opposed the bill in a statement in April, while students, faculty and Athens locals held multiple protests at the UGA Arch.Protestors used Deal's lengthy veto against a campus carry bill last year as part of their call for his veto this year.


 


Even Georgia U.S. Senator Johnny Isakson denounced an earlier version of the bill in a town hall in March, saying he did not think the proposal was ""the appropriate thing to do.""Multiple polls of the UGA community show roughly two-thirds of students and faculty are opposed to concealed carry on campus.“It is altogether appropriate that weapons not be allowed in sensitive areas on college campuses, and I appreciate the thoughtful consideration given by the General Assembly in expanding these excluded areas within a college campus in this year’s bill,” said Deal in a statement. ""As this legislation is more narrowly tailored as to exclude areas on a college campus, I’ve signed HB 280.”According to the Office of the Governor, HB 280 prohibits the carrying of a concealed weapon by anyone, including weapons carry license holders, on the following areas of a college campus:Buildings or property used for athletic sporting events; Student housing, including but not limited to dormitories, fraternity and sorority houses; Any preschool or childcare space; Any room or space being used for classes related to a college and career academy or other specialized school; Any room or space used for classes in which high school students are enrolled through a dual enrollment program, including, but not limited to, classes related to the “Move on When Ready Act”; Any faculty, staff, or administrative offices; and, Rooms where disciplinary proceedings are conducted.",Nate Harris | Senior Staff Writer,athensnews,https://www.redandblack.com/athensnews/breaking-gov-deal-signs-campus-carry-bill-into-law/article_5d86fc42-3118-11e7-9be7-fb42b9026f9a.html

5-May-17,OPINION: Take advantage of all UGA campus offers before summer,"During the week of finals, it’s easy to be locked up in your own personal bubble in an MLC study room. You may have managed to make some time to go to extracurriculars or hang out with friends downtown. However, there’s a lot more that this campus offers that you should take advantage of before you leave for summer.To begin, there are so many different natural getaways on campus. There’s the Founder’s Garden on North campus near Gilbert Hall. In it, you can see all types of plants and enjoy some time on a bench under trees. There’s also the Latin American Ethnobotanical Garden near Baldwin Hall.South Campus has the illustrious turtle pond in front of the ecology building. They’re friendly turtles, so if you stand in front of the pond the turtles will pop up out of the water in front of you.


 


On East Campus, there’s the Oconee Forest Park right next to the Intramural fields with 1.5 miles of hiking trails, a 1.2 mile mountain biking trail and a bridge that crosses Lake Herrick. Of course, there is also the wonderful Botanical Garden that is a short drive from campus.If you don’t feel like going into nature and want to stay indoors, spend some time in the building when no one is there to get a feel of the vibe of the building. For example, the upper floors of Park Hall feels vintage, like the entire building should be wearing thick rimmed glasses and oxford shoes. The Ecology building, in contrast, feels clean, lean and inherently sustainable.Also, some of the buildings are rumored to be haunted. Joe Brown is a famous example. It even has a staircase that leads to nowhere. It was rumored that when Joe Brown was still a dorm, a student living there during Christmas break died, and his spirit still roams the building. The department blocked off the part of the hall when remodeling it to house classrooms. Now there is a picture of Goethe on top of the stairs to nowhere. This is to supposedly let the ghost keep wandering the halls, keeping him occupied.On a less spooky note, there’s also the Georgia Museum of Art that will be open and is free to everyone. Exhibitions are changing all the time, so if you get a chance to stop by, you might not even see the same exhibit twice.As the school year comes to a close, it can be easy to forget that this campus offers more than just classrooms. You don’t have to go downtown or escape the city to enjoy what UGA has to offer. Before you leave for the summer, make sure to take advantage of all that this campus offers.CORRECTION: In a previous version of this article, it said Oconee Forest Park has more than 850 miles of trails. The Red & Black regrets this error.",Mariah Manoylov | Contributor,opinion,https://www.redandblack.com/opinion/opinion-take-advantage-of-all-uga-campus-offers-before-summer/article_390078aa-2e96-11e7-b556-d7171ae65eee.html
6-May-17,Inaugural Torrin Lawrence Memorial honors fallen Bulldog,"Elaine Davis woke up Friday morning in her home in Jacksonville, Florida, walked outside and felt the unusual chill of the Atlantic breeze.Perhaps it was the winds of change, leading her back to Athens once more.Davis and her daughter, LaTasha Lawrence, made the one-hour flight from their hometown to the place where their late son and brother, Torrin Lawrence, established a legacy of excellence.


 


“When he got here [for a visit], he wouldn’t consider anything other than Georgia was the place for him,” Davis said. “Once he set foot on this campus, that was it for him.”The family returned to Lawrence’s old training grounds Saturday to attend the inaugural meet held in his honor hosted by Georgia track and field.“I’m gonna keep it forever. As long as I’m the head coach here, that’s gonna be the Torrin Lawrence Memorial in honor of him every year,” head coach Petros Kyprianou said.Lawrence died on July 28, 2014, in a car accident on the way back from teammate Phillip Adam’s engagement party in Georgia. Lawrence was returning for training at the University of Florida when his car broke down on I-75 in Cordele, Georgia, and a tractor-trailer hit his vehicle. He was 25.Six years before, Lawrence arrived at Georgia in the fall of 2008 and immediately wowed his coaches, sprints assistant Jon Stuart and head coach Wayne Norton. The freshman burst onto the scene in the 2009 indoors campaign, winning the 400 meters at the Tyson Invitational with a then-world best time of 46.18 while also anchoring the Bulldogs’ 4x400 relay team to a comeback win.The Floridian went on to become the program’s lone national champion sprinter in the 2010 NCAA 400 meter Indoor Championships and a seven-time All-American at Georgia. He signed as a professional runner with Nike after graduating in 2013.

“I have to believe in him and his dreams. He felt like he could run on the pro circuit and he did,” Davis said. “He was just getting to the point where it was making a difference to him.”


 


Barely a year into his professional career, Lawrence died.Davis recalled traveling back up to Athens shortly after the accident to walk a lap around the Spec Towns track. Her son was the king of that quarter-mile, and still stands as the fifth-best performer in NCAA history in the event.“After he passed, I came back up here and walked the track. I was like ‘OK, I’ll never have to do that again.’ I never expected we’d be back up here at Georgia for this kind of honor,” Davis said.Kyprianou, who was an assistant for all four years Lawrence attended Georgia, sought out Davis last year at the Florida Relays to ask for her blessing for the Torrin Lawrence Memorial in 2017.“He really wanted to do it the year before, but he thought it was too soon,” Davis said. “He asked my permission and I said ‘Yes, of course.’”One year later, the inaugural meet brought in 13 schools for a one-day meet as teams prepare for conference championships.It also brought back Georgia track and field alumni to honor Lawrence, including Adams and Michael Proctor, two of Lawrence’s relay partners at Georgia, as well as members of the Torrin Lawrence Track Club from Jacksonville.As Lawrence, Proctor, Adams and Justin Gaymon’s 400-meter relay win at the Tyson Invite displayed on the videoboard, the two teammates — Adams and Proctor — and their fallen teammate’s mother held tight to each other.

10-May-17,How to recharge in Athens during May,"Whether you’re taking some time off from school, freshly graduated or just working through a summer class, May can serve as a month to recharge after the stress of the semester. If you’re looking for ways to enjoy Athens at a slower pace than normal, start by exploring some things you don’t normally have time for.YogaThere are a number of yoga studios around Athens that offer a variety of practices, from acro-yoga to therapy-driven. For beginners, consider Rubber Soul Yoga, located on Pulaski Street, for a wide range of introductory classes. Fees are donation-based, with a suggestion of $5 per class, but the studio allows participants to pay what they can.


 


Shakti Power Yoga, recently opened in the spring semester, holds many of its classes in 85 degree heat to induce sweat, offering vigorous exercise. The studio, located down Prince Avenue, is now offering a student special of 30 days for $30.Start running in the morningsWith your new, flexible schedule, you might be able to sleep in late more often than usual. Consider waking up early in the morning for a run, a free and energetic way to exercise as well as get more out of the day. If the area you live in doesn’t have a good path to run, try the State Botanical Gardens down South Milledge Avenue for scenic trails.Starting your day with a run helps create a healthy routine, and you might find it wakes you up more than coffee.ReadAs a college student, you most likely spend a good deal of your time reading for class. However, you might not spend nearly as much time reading things you actually enjoy.Take the summer to catch yourself up on those books you’ve had lying around without time to read, or start looking at The New York Times Books section for ideas. The Main Library is also home to classic books, new books and everything in between, so peruse its search system for whatever catches your eye.


 


The University of Georgia is also home to The Georgia Review, a literary journal full of quality short stories, essays and poetry. Check out their website to find new writers you might never have heard of otherwise and track down a copy to enjoy while you’re on North Campus.Cook moreWith all your free time, treat yourself to better meals than you do in the school year. Search the Internet for newfound recipes, or pick up a copy of Athens-based cookbooks, such as “The Grit Cookbook” or the new “Classic City Cooking” for homegrown ideas.Don’t be afraid to experiment outside of a recipe as well.

12-May-17,Georgia track and field teams in second place after first day of SEC championships,"After the first day of the SEC outdoor championships, Georgia track and field now boasts two new SEC champions, while both the men and women head into Friday in second place.Sophomore Denzel Comenentia earned his second SEC ring of the season with the outdoor hammer title on Thursday following his SEC indoor shot put title in February.“It feels great winning this title because I wasn’t expecting it,” Comenentia said. “To execute like I did late in the comp was an encouraging feeling.”


 


Comenentia, who owns top five NCAA marks this season in the hammer throw and shot put, rocketed a 234 foot, 3 inch throw—the best of his career—to win. His throwing partner, senior Alex Poursanidis, secured the bronze to combine for 16 team points in day one, tying with No. 1 Texas A&M in second place.True freshman Beatrice Llano became a newly-minted conference champion, winning the hammer throw competition by over six feet with a 215-foot throw.“I am proud to score points for my team and I think it proves that being a freshman is not an excuse,” Llano said.Llano registered 10 points for the Bulldogs with the victory. Fellow freshman and distance runner Sam Drop earned a sixth place finish in the 10,000 meters to chip in three team points and register Georgia in second place.In the combined events, junior Karl Saluri opened with a day one personal best in his first decathlon since the 2016 Olympics. Saluri’s 4,223 points puts him in second behind the NCAA’s all-time decathlon leader, Texas A&M’s Lindon Victor, who leads with 4,365.Freshman Louisa Grauvogel finished day one in fifth place in the women’s heptathlon. Sprinters Jeramey Hampton and Kendal Williams qualified for the finals in the 800 meters and 200 meters, respectively.",Kevin Mobley | Contributor,sports,https://www.redandblack.com/sports/georgia-track-and-field-teams-in-second-place-after-first/article_a80ec10e-3718-11e7-9055-57ef7a03fc25.html
14-May-17,Georgia track and field claims most individual titles since 2005 at SEC outdoor championships,"Not since 2005 has Georgia track and field returned back to Athens with more Southeastern Conference outdoor champions than it did Saturday night.A total of seven Bulldogs were crowned individual SEC gold medalists at the conference championships May 11-13. The No. 7 women’s team placed fourth and the No. 4 men’s team placed fifth in a conference that boasts 13 of the top 10 men’s and women’s squads nationally.“Overall, I thought our teams did a great job at SECs and made us proud for yet another meet to be a Bulldog,” head coach Petros Kyprianou said.


 


Tatiana Gusin, Keturah Orji and Devon Williams joined Beatrice Llano and Keenon Laine as SEC champions on Saturday, while Denzel Comenentia added his second SEC crown of the weekend.Gusin, a high jumper native to Athens, Greece, earned the first title of her Georgia career. She bested teammate and NCAA indoor high jump champion Mady Fagan, the only two jumpers to clear the 6-foot-2 mark. Gusin made that jump with one less scratch than Fagan, leading to her win.“Mady and I came here trying to finish one, two like we did at indoors and it worked out just right,” Gusin said. “We did exactly what we came here to do and I am excited that I have won my first championship for this team.""Orji, who has won every SEC triple jump championship — indoors and outdoors — since she began at Georgia in 2015, fired off a 45 foot, 5.25 inch jump on her second attempt that wouldn’t be matched before improving to 45 feet, 9.25 inches for her best jump.That mark is second in the country this year only to her own 2017 personal best jump of 46 feet, 11.5 inches a week ago at the Torrin Lawrence Memorial, a jump that is No. 2 in the world for 2017.""I am happy to win another title for my team and for myself in the triple,"" Orji said. ""I am not happy with the marks that came out of the competition but I know I have time to improve and get on track before we go to the NCAA meet.""Williams took the weekend off from the decathlon to compete in two of his best open events: the 110 meter hurdles and the long jump. He earned his first point on Friday in the long jump by placing eighth before besting the 2017 NCAA 60 meter hurdles champion, Florida’s Grant Holloway, in the 110 meter hurdles.Williams’ time of 13.37 seconds in the event ranks as the fastest collegiate time and the 10th-fastest time in the world this season.


 


“A lot of people didn't expect me to come here and win since I wasn't competing in the [decathlon] but when I go somewhere to compete, I always have the intention of trying to win,” Williams said.Comenentia closed out the day of Georgia’s first-place finishes by doubling up with the SEC shot put title to go with his hammer throw title from Thursday. His winning throw of 65 feet, 7.5 inches is the second-best throw of his career, just a foot and an inch shy of his career record throw at the Virginia Challenge in April.At the conclusion of Saturday’s events, the women’s team closed with 77 points to finish in fourth place, while the men registered 75 points to finish fifth.“This is just the first leg on our postseason journey and now we have to concentrate on getting everyone healthy and in the shape they need to be for prelims in two weeks,” Kyprianou said.",Kevin Mobley | Contributor,sports,https://www.redandblack.com/sports/georgia-track-and-field-claims-most-individual-titles-since-at/article_3b9e4a94-38b2-11e7-8660-6ff5a3015018.html
31-May-17,Two Georgia athletes earn SEC postseason honors,"Two of the five Southeastern Conference postseason women’s track and field honors were secured by Georgia athletes, the league announced Wednesday.Junior Keturah Orji was named SEC Women’s Field Athlete of the Year for the second year running, while freshman Beatrice Llano was named SEC Women’s Freshman Field Athlete of the Year, an honor that Orji achieved in 2015.Orji, a native of Mount Olive, New Jersey, currently owns five of the top nine triple jumps in NCAA history, including her No. 2 all-time mark in her 2017 outdoor opener at the Torrin Lawrence Memorial.


 


Llano, who hails from Bergen, Norway, stands as the No. 2 qualifier from the East region in the hammer throw. Llano posted the No. 3 mark in Georgia history earlier this season, and she will chase the top collegiate hammer throw all-time by former Bulldog Jenny Dahlgren over the course of her career.Orji, Llano and the No. 6 Georgia women travel to Eugene, Oregon, next week for the 2017 NCAA Outdoor Track and Field Championships.

9-Jun-17,UGA continues research on Baldwin Hall remains,"The University of Georgia is continuing to conduct research on the 105 gravesites found under Baldwin Hall in November 2015. According to a UGA Today press release, information about these bodies, said to have been remnants from the mid-1800’s, will be officially documented and accessible by Athens residents within the coming year.Gathering information on these bodies has been in progress since the bodies were first uncovered. Following the initial discovery, the university consulted with the State Archaeologist’s Office for guidance on how to proceed. A team of scholars was assembled to begin studying the “ancestry, age, sex and other characteristics about the individuals.”According to a the press release, researchers found “that the vast majority of these individuals were of maternal African descent.”


 


Specialists in ancient DNA from the University of Texas at Austin will conduct further analysis of the paternal ancestry of the remains, to supplement details about maternal ancestry discovered in the experiment’s first phase.In the press release, UGA Vice President for Research David Lee spoke on behalf of the university when he said they are committed “to building upon the preliminary research and learning more about the lives of the men, women and children, who were likely slaves or former slaves, given the time period,” who were found during Baldwin renovations.

Following the accumulation of this information, the supplemental DNA information will be open to the public in some manner so residents may potentially identify DNA linkages with the deceased.  According to the press release, The Office of Research is determining the most economically feasible option to offer this information to local residents.Alongside this information, Director of UGA’s Center for Geospatial Research Professor Marguerite Madden will be leading a team to put together a “dynamic time-series visualization” of the Athens area surrounding Baldwin Hall.Madden said she anticipates that this project will help university and community members understand the working and living places of these individuals. Madden said her team will also be documenting the “evolution of the Old Athens Cemetery, because records show it was once six acres in size and now it is two acres.”Madden said she hopes to create accurate 2D, 3D and 4D representations of the Athens landscape from 1800 to present, as pertains to the area surrounding Baldwin Hall, downtown Athens and surrounding residential areas.

Meetings will be held throughout the summer for Madden’s team to connect with community members and researchers to share information and progress on the project. This community effort to understand Athens’ history will also especially benefit two local high school students who, upon completion of the database, will “receive STEM (Science Technology Engineering and Math) training in the Geographic techniques of GIS, remote sensing and geo-visualization,” Madden said.Once the final database is completed, Madden said she hopes to share that information with various other researchers and expand upon the project by adding multimedia effects and community narratives.Southeastern Archaeological Services Inc. will also contribute to Madden’s project by conducting archival research and mapping services. The final report on Baldwin Hall will be submitted to Office of University Architects to the State Archaeologist's Office.",Kaley Lefevre | Staff Writer,athensnews,https://www.redandblack.com/athensnews/uga-continues-research-on-baldwin-hall-remains/article_9747d372-4d0e-11e7-b8ba-6396d24b49fb.html
9-Jun-17,"Oh boy, oh boy, oh boy: National Donald Duck Day","Eighty-three years ago today, Donald Duck graced screens for the first time in “The Wise Little Hen,” and he’s been quacking in our hearts and minds ever since. June 9th is National Donald Duck Day, a time to celebrate the man—or rather, duck himself.Donald Duck’s illustrious history has seen him serving in the military, acting as a surrogate father figure for his nephews and rivaling everyone’s favorite mouse across the decades. He has a strong enough following that it has sparked the technical name “Donaldism.” His sailor suit and distinctive voice make him iconic in his own right, though as a public figure he hasn’t been without criticism for choices like going pantsless.“I feel like people should lay off Donald Duck for not wearing pants because it’s hard for ducks to wear pants,” University of Georgia senior Kenlie Abernathy said. “He’s just more comfortable to be himself in that way. 


 


Ashley Habeck—an Athens native who has worked at Walt Disney World the past two and a half years—believes that while potentially controversial, the decision to not wear pants is a revolutionary part of Donald Duck’s legacy.“I wish that he could start a trend and everybody could not wear pants and not be judged,” Habeck said.Another often cited part of Donald Duck’s identity that is also critiqued is his temper. Animator Fred Spencer once said, “The Duck gets a big kick out of imposing on other people or annoying them, but he immediately loses his temper when the tables are turned. In other words, he can dish it out, but he can't take it.”According to Abernathy, Donald Duck’s irritability is part of the appeal for her.“I think that his grumpiness makes him who he is as a character,” Abernathy said. “People are saying that he’s the mean one, but what are they going to do if they have just happy people all the time?”Abernathy said that by the end of the Donald Duck short of “Mickey’s Once Upon a Christmas,” she was confident that the character had a deeper, more profound personality than many realize. The relationship between the duck and his nephews is evidence that Donald Duck is more than just grumpy, she said. “He has this underlying niceness about him that’s covered up by his adorable grumpiness,” Abernathy said. “He’s like the old man of the Disney characters.”Habeck said that although she is passionate about Disney in general, Donald Duck is definitely one of her favorite characters.


 


“He can be super sassy, but obviously he’s also really fun too,” Habeck said.The inclusion of the emotionally turbulent Donald Duck in a generally wholesome canon is more than incidental: the duck has been used in essential wartime propaganda as his complexity and emotional depth allows him to be more portrayed as more sophisticated than his rodent counterpart.Brian Sibley, who has written several books on the Disney Universe and Donald Duck, said of the matter, “[Donald Duck] was irascible, he was apt to fly off the handle, lose his temper. If you wanted a character to stand up to Hitler, you couldn't have one better than Donald Duck."" Eryn Underwood, a political science and religion double major currently visiting Walt Disney World, had similar words to say about Donald Duck, who she said she loved meeting at the park.“He’s kinda sassy and moody and full of himself,” Underwood said. “I think he’s very funny.”Underwood said that these factors made Donald Duck not only more relatable, but also unique in comparison with the other classic Disney characters.“It’s a nice flipside to the constant happiness and cheeriness of the other characters,” Underwood said.The duck’s place among his friendlier and goofier companions also speaks to the Disney universe’s inclusivity to all kinds, a fact that Habeck said she adores.

“I love the way that Disney just loves everybody,” Habeck said.To celebrate National Donald Duck Day, Habeck has a few suggestions.“Don’t wear pants around your house,” Habeck said. “Watch some old-school Disney stuff with Donald in it. Celebrate his origin.”",Laurel Hiatt | Assistant Culture Editor,culture,https://www.redandblack.com/culture/oh-boy-oh-boy-oh-boy-national-donald-duck-day/article_6bcf8350-4d1f-11e7-b5b7-33b1cff49c67.html
9-Jun-17,"Light, but powerful: Petros Kyprianou's strength and conditioning regimen beneficial for Georgia track and field","Light, but powerful. The mantra Georgia track and field head coach Petros Kyprianou has preached during his tenure in Athens has produced one of the most successful Georgia track teams in recent decades.He has a handful of Bulldogs primed to contend for individual and team awards at the 2017 NCAA Outdoor Track and Field Championships on June 7-10 in Eugene, Oregon.A former decathlete himself, Kyprianou won several track and field championships of his own in Cyprus and Greece. But even after he concluded his professional track career, his competitive juices did not stop flowing.


 


He shifted his focus to Olympic weightlifting, a sport he was first exposed to while growing up in Cyprus.“My body kind of fit the build of that sport,” Kyprianou said. “I kind of liked it to be honest with you, and I got hooked with it. And being light, I was moving some good weight, so people thought I could be pretty good at it, and I kind of stuck with it.”He began his career as a strength and conditioning coach, and it became his passion. Kyprianou and Georgia hold an edge in this regard over other programs nationwide, as he is the only head coach in the country who writes and implements his own workout regimen for the team, and he credits “90 percent of our success to that weightlifting program.”Track and field is all about explosion. With each step and every jump, an athlete must be able to generate a high level of power off of one foot or, in the case of throwing events, one arm. Georgia athletes have seen great strides in their fitness with a focus on exercises isolating each body part and geared toward explosive movements.“Track and field is strength and conditioning,” Kyprianou said. “I strongly believe that if the track coach writes and implements his or her own workouts, the success is going to be tremendous, because there is nobody better than the coach that knows the athletes.”Junior Mady Fagan has added a foot on her high jump marks, from jumping 5 feet 4 inches her freshman year to setting a new career-best in 2017 of 6-4.Ever since switching coaches her freshman year to work with Kyprianou, she has overcome technical issues with both her numbers in the weight room and her performance on the track. Fagan embodies the light but powerful theory with a lean build that is able to hold 300 to 400 pounds on her back.“I’m almost a foot higher than my freshman year, and I think the weight room has everything to do with it,” Fagan said. “I think physically, humans have a limit to jump, but I can keep getting stronger, and I do keep getting stronger.”


 


As is the case with any athletic team, injuries are a factor every athlete battles at one point or another. Georgia’s strength program helps those who were healthy to stay healthy, and those who are injured to recover quickly and correctly en route to nationals this month in Oregon.“You’ve got to understand the science behind the movement,” Kyprianou said. “It makes it a lot easier to prevent injuries. It starts with a good foundation in strength training.”The Bulldogs athletes are on board with the strength training not only because it helps their performance. They are happy with the visual element as well.The result of grueling workouts with no rest, and plyometrics between reps and sets, is a physique that most athletes are pleased to have earned.“I can already see it in my build, everybody else is saying ‘Dang Kendal, you’re getting bigger,’” said Kendal Williams, a sophomore sprinter who transferred from Florida State. “We didn’t do as many reps as we do here, and we definitely do the same types of exercises we do here. The bar is so much higher here than Florida State in terms of the weight room.”Williams is already repping significantly more weight than his maximums at Florida State. He is still learning the ins and outs of the program and ways to improve his techniques, factors he hopes will make him “stronger and stronger every year, and with that, hopefully getting faster and faster every year.”Kyprianou has not stopped improving himself. In October 2007, he set the Olympic weightlifting record in the state of Idaho in the 85kg weight class after putting up 567 pounds. He still lifts regularly and is looking to get back into the competitive sphere of the sport.The Georgia athletes count on Kyprianou not only to push them as their head coach, but also as a fellow competitor. The added motivation and technical expertise might just be what pushes Georgia over the hump at nationals this year and years to come.

“I’m as competitive as those guys,” Kyprianou said. “I was actually this close to competing in March, I actually signed up to go to Savannah and compete, but unfortunately I had other priorities, which was the NCAA [indoor] championships. I figured I should focus on that and not be too selfish.”",Matthew Couper | Contributor,sports,https://www.redandblack.com/sports/light-but-powerful-petros-kyprianou-s-strength-and-conditioning-regimen/article_f0a53844-4ac8-11e7-8235-f7a2752a9366.html
10-Jun-17,Two Athens restaurants recognized in “100 Plates Locals Love”,"Out of 750 dishes nominated across the state for the third annual “100 Plates Locals Love,” Athens made the list not only once, but twice.Georgia Eats, a culinary guide established by the Georgia Department of Economic Development’s Tourism division, highlights impressive restaurants across Georgia that attract state foodies and tourists alike. Specific entrees are nominated and reviewed by a panel of judges, and this year The National’s boquerones and home.made’s New Orleans Hot Chicken were both recognized as distinguished culinary masterpieces.“We are so excited to be included on the list of 100 Plates that locals love,” said Erin Wilson, The National’s Front of House Manager. “We’re definitely in agreement here that boquerones are one of our favorites, especially this time of year in the summer. With a glass of rosé on the patio, it’s pretty perfect.”


 


Boquerones, a type of Spanish tapa centered on anchovies, are plated at The National with pickled chili, caperberries and tomato-garlic toast. The Mediterranean food served at The National is influenced by its southern locale, while home.made features dishes that combine southern classics with owner Mimi Maumus’s Louisiana origins, exemplified by chosen dish New Orleans Hot Chicken.“It’s a meaningful dish for me in particular, since I’m from New Orleans,” Maumus said. “It’s sort of the dish that blends my New Orleans roots and more traditional southern food.”New Orleans Hot Chicken, which plays on Nashville Hot Chicken, is fried with home.made’s house hot sauce and then served with beignets and pickled okra to substitute the traditional white bread and dill pickles.In a press release from the Athens Convention & Visitors Bureau, Director Chuck Jones said that he was not surprised that two restaurants from Athens made the list.“Athens restaurants hit every culinary point of view and budget just right,” Jones said. “Our local chefs impressively blend fresh culinary options with classic favorites to create a unique restaurant scene that can't be found anywhere else.""",Laurel Hiatt | Assistant Culture Editor,culture,https://www.redandblack.com/culture/two-athens-restaurants-recognized-in-plates-locals-love/article_c12da68e-4d41-11e7-90f7-0724b412daad.html
11-Jun-17,OPINION: Corn on the cob is an embodiment of the American way,"One of the best parts of every summer is the chance for festive outdoor barbecues and friendly neighborhood potlucks, complete with noisy chattering, a dad-like character at the grill and platter after platter of delicious cooking.In the midst of all the grilled meat, iced tea and dressed-up salads stands a contender for most American dish, one often overlooked for hamburgers or fried chicken or some other aggrandized food. This Jun. 11, on its very own national holiday, it’s time to recognize and celebrate the national icon that is corn on the cob.Corn, at its root, is a fundamentally American crop—in fact, much of American industry and even history revolve around this emblem of the American dream. Native Americans as early as 7,000 years ago transformed wild grass Teosinte into a modern maize, familiar to what is seen today. The Maya people, one of the great early American civilizations, ate their corn right off the cob.


 


This dietary staple evolved across millennia as it spread throughout the world and its cultures, eventually becoming useful beyond its deliciousness and nutritional utilities for humans (corn provides about 21 percent of worldwide nutrition and has 10 times more Vitamin A than other grains). Nowadays, corn accounts for more than 95 percent of feed grain and is processed into products from sugary breakfast cereal to the most significant biofuel in America, ethanol.The many accolades of corn are considerable, but there is a simplistic wholesomeness about corn on the cob that sets it apart from the rest of the pack. The crunch of kernels being separated from the cob against one’s teeth is an unparalleled experience that can be perfected by simply adding salt and butter. The more adventurous can try daring flavors from lemon and lime to sriracha or chipotle, reflecting the versatility of the American way.Corn on the cob also champions authenticity, a nationally prized virtue. In the 1921 “Book of Etiquette” by Lillian Eichler Watson, corn on the cob is described as “without a doubt one of the most difficult foods to eat gracefully."" It’s messy, juicy, and leaves interdental traces, but isn’t that part of the appeal? Americans are a “down and dirty” kind of people who embrace situations that are a little difficult to navigate head on, like conquering a cob with a collar-tucked napkin.Although committing to devouring corn on the cob is essential to the experience, there are still ways to customize the venture, like how the American dream has been personalized for hundreds of millions of citizens. Roasting, grilling, slow-cooked, butter boiled— the list goes on with ways to experiment with the experience. Skewers enhancing grip and satisfaction range from homemade dinosaurs to sophisticated steel, ensuring that there’s a set for every family.From the intact cob to the kernel-less end product, the entirety of the process is filled with potential for nuance that it is sure to satisfy taste buds as well as a deeper sense of American identity.",Laurel Hiatt | Assistant Culture Editor,opinion,https://www.redandblack.com/opinion/opinion-corn-on-the-cob-is-an-embodiment-of-the/article_03c4da2c-4ebd-11e7-9795-6b177f60f309.html

12-Jun-17,5 tips to make short work of long distance,"Although summer is celebrated as one of the funnest, freest times of the year for students in general, there’s another side that’s less jovial: the summer months often separate friends, family and loved ones as they scatter to the wind. Whether you’re looking to keep in touch with a best friend who goes home across the country once classes are out, leaving your family for the first time for an internship or staying in touch with a significant other on a study abroad, the following five tips can help keep things both fun as well as in perspective. 1. Watch a movie togetherThe future is now when it comes webcams, voice calls and the like. Websites like Rabbit let you watch Netflix, Youtube and other streaming sites while simultaneously video chatting, so that whatever you watch is synced perfectly and you can pause whenever to discuss it. This way, movie nights are possible between people across the world from each other.


 


2. Play games to connectWhile you might be over playing Candy Crush on your phone, there are easy ways to talk and bond through other games and applications. Facebook Messenger has games like chess and H-O-R-S-E that can be played with another person or in a message group, and classics like Words with Friends or Draw Something that have chat options allow for an easy way to interact casually and make up for the geographic distance.3. Make plans for the futureDaydreams aren’t healthy to live in, but they can be fun to indulge in. Planning your reunion with the person you’re separated from gives you both something to look forward to, as well as a concrete end to the long distance to focus on and make the waiting a little bit easier. Whether it’s a major date back together with your partner or a relaxing day back at home, a semi-solid plan can comfort both sides of the separation.4. Write lettersIn the age of instant communication, there’s something special about taking the time to send an actual letter. Whether crisply typed or lovingly handwritten, sending a letter through the mail that’s both deliberate and in-depth will not only prove a meaningful message, but also a memento after the distance is closed.5. Experience your surroundings fullyWhether you’re abroad in an exotic city or waiting at home for everyone else to return from their adventures, you might as well make the most of the summer.

12-Jun-17,Rags to riches: Red Dress Boutique owner Diana Harbour grew her business from the ground up,"According to Forbes magazine, about 90 percent start-up businesses fail within their first year. More fail in the next five years. Red Dress Boutique owner, Diana Harbour, serves as an exception to that bleak statistic.Nestled in between Clubhouse and a Ben & Jerry’s on one of the busiest streets downtown, Red Dress Boutique was born out of the creative mind of Harbour while she was working a cubicle job at a credit card processing company.Harbour first began fostering her love for fashion in high school with the E! Television show, “Runway.” However, the passion stemmed from something far deeper than just clothes.


 


“I loved the artistry of it. It had nothing to do with fashion, it was the artistry of the fabrication and designing the prints,” Harbour said.At the time, Harbour didn’t really know what she wanted to do. Diagnosed with ADHD and OCD, she struggled all throughout her schooling years to control her disorders since her parents were anti-medication.Despite all that and not knowing where she was headed, Harbour was confident in her passion. She knew she had a love for the art of fashion and that she wanted to do something with that.Reaching an Epiphany and Taking ChancesHarbour attended Columbus State University, where she majored in English and minored in art. During her four years in college, she worked at three different boutiques in Columbus. It was there that she found her love for small business clothing stores.“I fell in love with the environment. It was such a close atmosphere in comparison to a department store. I was right up under the owner and got first hand knowledge of what they did,” Harbour said.Working at the different boutiques over her four years at college fostered her desire to open her own small dress shop. But, when she graduated college, she began working at TSYS, a credit card processing company, instead “Have you ever seen the movie “Office Space”? Yeah, I lived it,” Harbour said, “I stayed in that job for 90 days and in that 90 days I plotted my escape. 


 


With her husband, Josh, Harbour began laying out the idea for her store. She decided on Athens as the home for Red Dress when her husband took her to visit for a football game in 2004.“I could care less about the football game. I had never seen anything like downtown Athens. There weren’t any chains: it was all small businesses and they were successful,” Harbour said.While Harbour was ready to jump head first into her new passion project, her father wasn’t entirely thrilled with the idea. Despite starting a small farm business himself, he wanted Harbour to be prepared for the hard times to come. So he brought Harbour and her husband into his office and sat them down with his accountant to find out just how dedicated they were to this plan.“I just sat there saying ‘that’s not going to be me. That’s not going to be me. That’s not going to be me,’” Harbour said.Ultimately Harbour got her wish. She had found a small 800-square foot area on Baxter Street during her initial visit to Athens and, two weeks after visiting, she returned to Athens to sign the lease for the space. A week later, Harbour and her husband put their house on the market. Once it sold another week later, Harbour and her husband quit their jobs with TSYS and made the move to Athens.Humble Beginnings & Obstacles OvercomeThe first year the couple spent in Athens was difficult. After taking out a six figure loan and investing most of what they made selling their house into the store, Diana and Josh didn’t have enough money to buy a house. Instead, Josh asked friends to let him and Diana sleep in spare bedrooms on a rented air mattress. They lived out of one suitcase each and paycheck to paycheck, with Josh working at Enterprise Rent a Car and Diana devoting all her time to Red Dress.“That teaches you that you can do without. We would go to On the Border and split fajitas because it was enough to fill us up and we were out $13. That was a splurge. You do what you have to do,” Harbour said.

Against all odds, Diana managed to transform Red Dress Boutique from a tiny space on Baxter Street into the successful small company it is today.There were bumps in the road along they way. In September 2008, America experienced an economic recession that put many stores in Athens out of business. When Harbour had first come to Athens in 2005, there had been about 15 successful boutiques between downtown and Five Points. By 2009, 12 had gone out of business.“I used to take a walk down the streets of downtown just to see who went out of business that week,” said Josh Harbour, COO of Red Dress. “It was not a good time.”Though Harbour, like many other store owners in Athens at the time, was used to selling high end clothing, Harbour was able to adapt Red Dress. Harbour shifted the model of the store to primarily be at a price point below $50 by buying from up and coming indie designers that sold quality fashion at an affordable price.“What Diana’s really able to do is sift through 95 percent of all the fast fashion out there that isn’t up to her standards, and find the 5 percent that is under $50 and a good value at that price point,” Josh Harbour said.A Bullet Train that Never StopsHowever, just because the store itself has become a fully realized dream doesn’t mean that Harbor has stopped. In fact, ever since she launched her website in 2012, it’s been a non-stop bullet train.“There isn’t really much time to reflect. You don’t develop this business, get to plateau for a second and sit up and look down. She truly is still running this thing from the ground up, so there is no reflection,” said Kristen Kacmar, Vice President of Marketing for Red Dress.  

Despite the constant stress and influx in work to do, Diana loves the fast paced nature of what she does.“I love it. It’s perfect for the ADHD,” said Harbour, “I am a bullet train.”An Expression of HerselfPart of the reason Harbour loves what she does is because Red Dress isn’t just something that represents the tangible manifestation of her dream; it’s her creative outlet.“From the second you walk in the door, this company is Diana. Every single thing you look at, it is an evolution of Diana; it is current Diana. The employees here, the color paint on the wall, the way it is set up,” said Kacmar. “This company is Diana Harbour, from tip to tail.”The store is where Harbour feels truly happy and entirely herself. In fact, contrary to what many believe, the store was named in testament to her happiness. Red Dress didn’t get its name because it was started at the University of Georgia; it got it’s name because, when Harbour was two years old, she used to always wear the color red.“My mom said ‘you loved the color red. It made you happy.’ So I called [the store] Red Dress, because that was a moment in my lifeline that a color made me really happy, so much so that I wanted to wear it everyday,” Harbour said.Looking Forward

Like always, Harbour and her goals for Red Dress are growing and evolving.Coming late this summer, the company will release a mobile app and site as well as a new design for the website. Along with that, Diana herself has fulfilled her other dream and quietly released four in-house lines on the Red Dress website: Oura, Story, Fable, and Ever After.“In life, you have two choices: you can have security or you can have freedom. And if you work your ass off, you can have both of them. That’s what I wanted to do,” Harbour said.

13-Jun-17,Athens Pet Market celebrates one year of business,"On the east side of Athens, pet owners once had to drive out of their way to the other side of town to get supplies for their animals. This ended last year, when the Athens Pet Market opened as the first pet store on the eastern side of town. On June 2, the owners celebrated their first anniversary of the store’s grand opening.Geraldine Saavedra, along with her boyfriend Raul Vargas, was responsible for coming up with the idea of a new pet store in the underserved eastern area. After Raul moved from Miami to Athens, the two noticed the lack of pet stores and decided to change this themselves.“We celebrated ourselves,” Saavedra said.


 


The store offers food and toys for a large variety of animals, as well as full grooming and bath services. The owners said they value their customers and treat them as their main priority.“It is a small store, so we are more in contact with people,” Saavedra said. “We make conversation and it is more one-to-one conversation with customers."" Their way of treating customers as friends has earned them many loyal customers, one of whom is Athens local, Eva Cram.“The owners are really nice people who provide my brand of dog food near where I live, which is much easier than ordering online or driving across town,” Cram said.The employees in the store are dedicated to making sure customers receive the best price on their pet supplies. Olivia Austin, a student at the University of Georgia, is one of the employees who says the customers are her first priority. “We price check everything,” Austin said. “So if something sells on Amazon for, lets say 15 dollars, then we make sure it goes on our shelves cheaper.”The store makes sure to stock their shelves with brands that are both inexpensive and recommended by veterinarians. Some of the brands they provide include Taste of the Wild, Royal Canin, Acana, Purina, and many more.“We sell the healthier side of dog and cat foods, that means there are no fillers,” Austin said.


 


With top of the line pet brands for sale, an experienced groomer and a convenient location, it’s no wonder this store has built up a large customer base. Its status as a newer store, however, means that Athens Pet Market still has room to grow.  “Hopefully in the future, more people will talk about us and we’ll carry more brands of food and continue to grow little by little,” Saavedra said.",Jaime Conlan and Tessa Green | Staff Writer and Contributor,culture,https://www.redandblack.com/culture/athens-pet-market-celebrates-one-year-of-business/article_a8d21cbe-4fe4-11e7-b72d-0f7b9d610d0d.html
16-Jun-17,OPINION: Buying higher quality clothes is a better investment for college students,"College students tend to be low on cash, and are often tempted to bargain-hunt as a way to find affordable clothing, shoes and other forms of attire. And though these product’s low price tags are appealing at first, in the long term these items are usually cheaply made and fall apart easily; it is a better investment to spend a more on quality clothing. Spending more money on clothing is oftentimes related to the brand—consumers are spending more money on the label than on the actual item of clothing. However, many brands that lack the visible logos charge more because the product itself is made from higher-quality materials. Buying better quality clothing locally is also advantageous to both consumers and store owners. Shopping at vintage stores like Dynamite or The Pope on Prince, where the products are restocked frequently, provides a great variety of unique pieces to consumers that are hard to find anywhere else. Additionally, buying locally helps support local businesses in Athens which helps the community blossom.  


 


Thrifting, or shopping at bigger-name consignment or “resale” stores like Clothes Mentor, is another alternative. Though the clothes are pre-owned, they are usually in good condition and are much cheaper than buying similar items brand new. Consumers can also sell their clothing to the store, which is a great way to earn some cash or credit that can be used on future purchases. For shoppers who do not want to buy secondhand clothing, it is still possible to shop consciously. There is nothing wrong with buying new, trendy items that will only be worn once or twice, but oftentimes these pieces end up sitting in the back of the closet collecting dust. Reselling them or donating to places like Goodwill, the Salvation Army or homeless shelters can give unwanted items a new life while opening up closet space for new items. This practice helps eliminate some of the wasteful practices caused by “fast fashion” and can help prevent people from simply throwing away old items that are still in relatively good condition. For those who cannot or will not buy items that are not discounted, buying clothes out of season can help save money as well. For example, buying jackets in the summer or swimsuits in winter can ensure a lower price tag on a good quality item, opposed to buying right before the season begins. Stores at outlet malls, like Tanger Outlets or the North Georgia Premium Outlets, can also provide good quality items from name brands at much lower prices, particularly on holiday weekends like Memorial Day or Fourth of July.  Last summer, instead of splurging on a pair of $95 Birkenstocks, I decided to buy a pair of knockoffs for only $22.99. Although this store’s products usually hold up well, the shoes have worn out tremendously within the span of a year and likely will only last a few more months a most. If I had just saved up for a bit longer, I could have purchased the better-quality name brand that would have likely lasted much longer. Taking advantage of different retailers can greatly improve one’s shopping experience and help extend the life of clothing. Buying fewer, better quality items as opposed to many cheaply-made, inexpensive ones can reduce waste and save money in the long run.",Anika Chaturvedi | Contributor,opinion,https://www.redandblack.com/opinion/opinion-buying-higher-quality-clothes-is-a-better-investment-for/article_9469986e-507b-11e7-86ae-076d3310bbc6.html

6-Jul-17,Beeps and Bases: A beep baseball team in Athens for the visually impaired,"The baseball game begins as any other. A pitcher, a catcher, infielders and outfielders all stand dressed in yellow, tense and ready. Yet, as the innings start, the slightly larger-than-average baseball begins chirping, and all the players other than the pitcher and catcher are blindfolded. It doesn’t matter for several who are already completely blind, but it levels the playing field for those visually impaired to different extents.These are the Athens Timberwolves, and this is beep baseball.Out of left field


 


The oldest member of the Athens Timberwolves is team captain Roger Keeney at 72 years old. Rex Bennett, the team’s pitcher and youngest player, is 18 years old and just graduated from a nearby high school. Keeney, who is also the director of Athens Inclusive Recreation and Sports, has been blind for almost three decades, while Bennett is not visually impaired. The circumstances bringing the group of all ages together in Athens range from luck to a deliberate effort.For Bennett, his involvement began last spring after his uncle Harry Simmons lost his eyesight to diabetes.“We were trying to find something for him to do that was competitive, didn’t matter how,” said Mike Bennett, Rex’s father.After Harry Simmons began playing for the Athens Timberwolves, Bennett was invited to practices and, because of his pitching experience, onto the team. Beep baseball permits two regular sighted players, the pitcher and the catcher, who may cycle through the positions of the team blindfolded if needed. Veering from his previous baseball coaching of Little League teams, Mike Bennett learned these rules when he was invited to be the team’s second coach.“[My son and I] started demonstrating, and we were like, ‘Oh yeah, they can’t see,’” Bennett said of his early coaching.Rita Harris—one of the newest recruits from Madison—found the team and her role as outfielder more indirectly. Harris is legally blind after losing her vision, but has kept up her adventurous lifestyle, from bungee jumping to skydiving.“Even with me losing a large percent of my vision, I don’t let that hold me back or stop me from doing what I like to do,” Harris said. Harris formed a support group in her area for the blind/visually impaired and, after having Keeney as a guest speaker, joined the Timberwolves. While she has participated in the Georgia Blind Sports Association’s tandem bike-riding and kayaking, this is Harris’s first competitive team sport.


 


“I enjoy the whole concept of beep baseball, the way it’s designed,” Harris said. “In normal circumstances, a blind person or visually impaired person wouldn’t be able to participate in sports. Modifying it allows you to do those things and builds your confidence—it makes you feel whole again.”Dealing with a curve ballIf it takes a village to raise a child, it takes an entire community to get a team to the 2017 National Beep Baseball Association World Series at the end of July. There are 34 teams registered with the National Beep Baseball Association for the 2017 season, but only 24 will attend the World Series in West Palm Beach, Florida, including international teams from countries such as Taiwan and the Dominican Republic.One of the limiting factors of team attendance is cost. The per-person price of the World Series is about $800 to stay the full week from July 23 – 30. Alongside the 10 Timberwolves players going to the World Series, there are about 10 volunteers accompanying them. While the players can apply for scholarships, the volunteers—including head coach April McKaig—cannot.“We are extremely fortunate to be supported by the Delta Gamma sorority,” McKaig said. “They do fundraisers for us, they come and help with the practices. We could not ask for a better sponsor and supporter.”The team, including McKaig, has made it to the World Series for the past five years. There, the Timberwolves are able to take their athleticism to the next level.“I didn’t know a lot of teams really played that hard until I went my very first year,” said Tamara Atkinson, who plays shortstop and center field. Atkinson was one of the founding members of the team alongside Keeney and her husband. She is legally blind and her husband is partially blind. While he no longer plays, she is looking forward to another World Series as well as the baseball cards McKaig gives to the team afterwards.

“Okay, so they can’t see it, but they know they’ve got it,” McKaig said.The support of the volunteers and the promise of their own merchandise gets the Timberwolves through the grueling five days of the tournament, where the athletes play three games a day.Step up to the plate“Watching it, you’re absolutely amazed because they’re more athletic and better at some of it than the professional ball players,” McKaig said.McKaig has a long history with beep baseball, despite not being blind herself. She co-founded the Hall County Blind Bats, which only lasted one season, before asking Keeney to be involved with the Timberwolves upon its formation in 2013. Since then, she said she has cherished being “the mother of the pack.”VIDEO: Athens Timberwolves prepare for the Beep Baseball World Series

        “It’s hard to describe the pleasure and joy I get,” McKaig said. “I love my team. I love my pack.”

McKaig has experienced the ups and downs of a typical coach, from the addition of star players to a broken collarbone keeping a team member from the World Series. Above all, McKaig emphasizes the athletic ability of the Timberwolves, as does Mike Bennett. “It gives you a total sense of appreciation once you’re in pitch darkness. You’re trying to hit a ball coming from 20 feet away, and the base is beeping a hundred feet away,” Bennett said.  “You’ve got to run in a straight line towards it and trust you’re not going to run into someone else. It’s amazing confidence they have, and athletic ability.”

The team is so confident, they have extended a challenge to the UGA football team for the past three years to play against them. In the meantime, the Timberwolves practice against the UGA Lost Dawgs, a collection of students gathered by kinesiology professor Kevin McCully. The Timberwolves and the UGA Lost Dawgs will play a final game before the World Series July 8 at Satterfield Park, 10 a.m. Even now, the players are confident about their abilities.“I’m looking forward to bringing home the championship ring,” Harris said. “I feel confident. I’m not nervous, I just do what I do.”",Laurel Hiatt | Assistant Culture Editor,sports,https://www.redandblack.com/sports/beeps-and-bases-a-beep-baseball-team-in-athens-for/article_c5e3059a-6261-11e7-b1b4-038682ade3d4.html
8-Jul-17,OPINION: Restore UGA’s restrooms,"Though many of the older buildings at UGA have been renovated over the years, there is one aspect that has remained neglected: bathrooms.The newer buildings’ restrooms such as the MLC, Tate Student Center and Bolton Dining Commons, are spacious, equipped with modern technology and ventilated. This is not the case for some of the restrooms in the older buildings on campus.Joe Brown Hall was built in 1932 as a dorm, and has since been remodeled into offices and classrooms. However, there are still shower fixtures in the upstairs girl’s restroom. The showers serve no purpose, and are collecting dust and dirt. The restroom is also poorly ventilated, making the air in the facility humid and stuffy.


 


Peabody Hall’s restrooms are located in the basement, and the windows are tiny and offer little lighting. Despite the amount of cleaning, the smell and humidity linger due to the location of the restrooms.According to the CDC, mold and mildew are likely to build up in areas of poor ventilation. Mold and mildew can cause respiratory illnesses, and are dangerous for those with allergies.“Sometimes the smell isn’t too pleasant even though the bathrooms are cleaned pretty regularly,” Hend Rasheed, a sophomore genetics major, said.There are also equipment and structural problems in some restrooms. Park Hall asks people to flush the toilets with their hands rather than their feet to prevent water leakage from the handles.Some restroom stalls, such as the ones in Gilbert Hall, are incredibly cramped, making it is hard to open and close the doors without bumping into the toilet, especially when students bring their backpacks into the stalls in order to keep an eye on their possessions.“The bathrooms in the Biological Sciences Building are poorly designed because they’re small. Getting in and out is a little inefficient. If someone is coming out, you can’t go in at the same time and vice versa,” Hend said.According to a study by NPR about, despite facilities being cleaned and sterilized completely of bacteria and microbes, if a bathroom is older and poorly ventilated, certain bacteria such as Staphylococcus will recolonize upon bathroom surfaces. Coming into contact with restrooms at UGA can expose people to bacteria that could potentially affect their health, due to the size of the rooms, stalls and age of the building,.Many of the older buildings on North Campus haven’t been renovated since the early ‘70s. UGA should take the initiative to renovate these old restrooms to keep its students healthy and comfortable.

11-Jul-17,OPINION: Take the time to learn about the LGBTQ community,"On June 27th, UGA’s LGBTRC held a Safe Space training for faculty, staff, and students interested in learning about gender and sexual identity, homophobia, heterosexism and how to provide support and work towards being an ally for the LGBT community.This program is important because students, faculty and staff of the University of Georgia need to have a dialogue about LGBT+ students to create accepting spaces on campus. STudents should be encouraged to attend one of these seminars or one similar to it.“Our mission is to be inclusive of all students, regardless of sexual orientation, gender identity and expression. We tend to act that out especially through education and support. And so that’s a large portion of what our Safe Space Training is meant to do,” said Fowler, an administrative assistant for the LGBTRC and facilitator for safe space training.


 


To begin to understand the experiences of queer students, it is essential to understand the language used. For example, while most people outside of the queer community know “binders” as folders to hold papers, whereas transgender, gender non-conforming and nonbinary people know binders as pieces of fabric meant to compress breasts to give the appearance of a flat chest.A thorough conversation about queer identity requires everyone to be on the same page regarding terminology and definitions. That is why it is essential for those interested in learning more about the queer community to attend educational events like Safe Space training to learn the vocabulary.Those in the queer community didn’t enter understanding all the vocabulary and definitions. It requires research, time and studying to understand the culture of a community. If someone outside the community wants to understand, they need to study and do research as well.This study and research can come in the form of conversation. “Safe Space training is meant as a conversation, as a dialogue, for people to have… it’s meant to be able to provide people with the space to have those conversations that we’re not always able to have,” said Fowler.There are infinitely many ways to find information; as long as the person searching listens with intention and compassion to the experiences of others, any way to learn is the correct way. But this dialogue must be had, and this learning must be completed, in order to further progress towards acceptance on the UGA campus.  While it may take some effort, it is worth it to have a more inclusive and safer environment for the entire UGA population.Additional Safe Space trainings will be held July 12th, 26th, and throughout the fall and spring semesters.

12-Jul-17,Homecoming scheduling adds some intensity to one-sided Georgia-Vanderbilt series,"HOOVER, Ala. - The topic of homecoming games was brought up several times to several different coaches and players at SEC Media Days, largely thanks to Florida’s recent scheduling of LSU for its homecoming game in 2017.Usually when a school schedules its homecoming game, it chooses a “cake walk” game — a game against a weaker opponent that is sure to be a win for the home team.In 2016, Georgia scheduled Vanderbilt as its homecoming game. That plan backfired, as the Commodores traveled to Athens on Oct. 16 and beat the Bulldogs 17-16 in front of a crowd expecting to see their team walk away with the victory.


 


Now, Vanderbilt has returned the favor in 2017.When Georgia heads north to Nashville for its week 6 matchup against Vanderbilt, it will be homecoming for the Commodores. It’s a somewhat surprising move, especially considering Vanderbilt hosts Western Kentucky three weeks later on Nov. 4.In the past 10 years between Georgia and Vanderbilt, the Bulldogs are 8-2. Going back 20 years, Georgia is 17-3. So why does it feel like the recent series is much closer than actually it is?“It’s an SEC game so it’s a huge game just like any other SEC opponent,” said Vanderbilt linebacker Oren Burks. “But I mean, it’s also a game to get up for.”It’s ironic to see Vanderbilt schedule Georgia as its homecoming game after a year in which the Commodores beat the Bulldogs in their homecoming game. It would be even more ironic, however, if Georgia goes to Nashville and rains on Vanderbilt’s homecoming parade.Just ask Vanderbilt running back Ralph Webb.“It’s very quiet in the stadium when you beat a team on their homecoming,” Webb said.",Zach Shugan | Assistant Sports Editor,sports,https://www.redandblack.com/sports/homecoming-scheduling-adds-some-intensity-to-one-sided-georgia-vanderbilt/article_3042eb0c-6691-11e7-8a77-432c6c7ab353.html
24-Jul-17,"Former, current and future Georgia track athletes succeed on the international stage","Former, current and future Bulldogs alike posted a bevy of top track and field results on the world stage last  weekend as they competed at the 2017 Pan-American Junior Games, World Para Athletics Championships and the Under-20 European Championships.Georgia alumnus and 2016 Paralympian Jarryd Wallace secured the 2017 World Para-Athletic title in the 200 meters on Saturday with a time of 22.53 seconds. Wallace also claimed bronze in the 100 meters a week prior.Current Bulldog distance runner Samantha Drop represented the Bulldogs at the Under-20 Pan-Am Juniors alongside signee Tara Davis. Drop finished third in the 5,000 meters with a time of 16:44, one of only three sub-17 minute times in the event.


 


Davis reached the podium twice on Friday. First, she won a silver medal in the 100-meter hurdles at 13.05 seconds, just four-hundredths behind Marietta product Tia Jones. Then, she took home a gold medal of her own in the long jump with a 6.51-meter jump, one that would have been the new Pan-Am Junior Games record if it had not been wind-assisted.Fellow 2016 signee Johannes Erm rounded out the weekend by posting a career best and the new Estonian national junior record in the decathlon with 8,141 points at the U-20 European games.",Kevin Mobley | Contributor,sports,https://www.redandblack.com/sports/former-current-and-future-georgia-track-athletes-succeed-on-the/article_12fea378-707e-11e7-90f2-9fc94c44d866.html
27-Jul-17,OPINION: Bras off and breast cancer awareness,"A common myth is that by wearing a bra women increase their chances of getting breast cancer. While research has been conducted in the past to test this theory, there has never been anyevidence linked between wearing a bra and breast cancer. Despite this, many women still do not enjoy wearing one, as there is nothing quite as liberating as “freeing the girls.”Morgan Tolbert, a junior majoring in early childhood education, is one women that will knowingly leave her house without wearing a bra.“I don’t wear one because I simply don’t like it,” said Tolbert. “I am much more comfortable without wearing a bra, and I don’t think I should be forced to wear one just because it’s what women are supposed to do.”


 


Like Tolbert more people need not fear going bra-less, it is a perfectly normal thing to do, despite societal standards.There is a whole day dedicated to not wearing a bra onOctober 13th. the day is supposed to raise awareness for breast cancer. There are many people that have never been directly affected by breast cancer, and by devoting a day to bring awareness to those that have suffered from the dreadful disease, society gets the chance to be educated on breast cancer and its effects.Athens has a local organization known asIn Their Shoes, sponsored by Piedmont Athens Regional, where people can go to learn more about breast cancer facts, and donate or volunteer to help those diagnosed with breast cancer. In their Shoes, is a 13.1 mile walk that takes place yearly in Athens to bring awareness and raise money for breast cancer research.Athens also has a non-profit organization known asAthens Area Cancer Auxiliary (AACA). They focus on educating, projects, and raising funds all locally in the Athens area.With so many local outlets in the community, breast cancer knowledge should do nothing but take off from here. So, ignore those myths wear a bra or don’t, and in the process take steps in to be aware and prevent breast cancer. We all need to take initiative to aid in the research, funding and preventio of this disease, so maybe one day in the future our daughters and granddaughters will not be affected like women are today.",Lyndsey McElhannon | Contributor,opinion,https://www.redandblack.com/opinion/opinion-bras-off-and-breast-cancer-awareness/article_f9a23d42-6d6f-11e7-9380-6718b3e9b944.html
29-Jul-17,Campus Carry FAQ: What you need to know about the new law,"After years of debate, protests, edits, setbacks and victories, HB 280,also known as Campus Carry, went into effect in the state of Georgia on July 1. As UGA heads into its first full length semester of the new law, The Red & Black has put together a set of frequently asked questions to make sure you know everything you need to know.What is Campus Carry?: Campus Carry is the informal name for a conglomeration of recent bills looking legalize the carrying of concealed weapons on property owned and leased by university. 


 


Wasn’t that vetoed?: Yes, Governor Deal vetoed HB 859 on May 3, 2016.An updated version of the bill was introduced the following year in 2017, known as HB 280. After lawmakers addressed Deal’s concerns regarding exemptions within HB 859, they passed a newer version of Campus Carry legislation that Deal signed into law this year on May 4. So who can bring a gun to campus?: Concealed carry permit holders will be now be able to bring their handguns to campus. In order to obtain a concealed carry permit in the state of Georgia, one must be over the age of 21 and go through an application process with their local probate court. This process requires fingerprints, a criminal history and background check and a mental health clearance if the applicant has a history of mental health issues. Georgia also honors reciprocity agreements with over 30 other states.  Just handguns?: Yes. 


 


 Can you carry a gun anywhere?: No, there are several exemptions. Buildings that host athletic events, student housing buildings such as dorms and Greek houses, preschool or childcare facilities, classrooms with dual-enrolled high school students, faculty offices and any space used for disciplinary hearings.  Do tailgates and gyms count as athletic events?: No, the legislation specifies that tailgates and student recreation facilities are not subject to exemption. It should also be noted that it is illegal to carry while under the influence of alcohol, so you shouldn’t expect to see many guns at tailgates. What about field trips and excursions away from the University?Campus Carry does not apply to institution-sponsored events or excursions away from campus on property not leased or owned by a University System institution.

30-Jul-17,OPINION: Stricter tailgating rules restrict traditions,"Tailgating is something most football fans look forward to every fall, yet with some recent changes, University of Georgia fans are unhappy.The biggest change will be campus carry. Guns will now be allowed at tailgates on campus, but only if you have not consumed any alcohol. It is not clear how this will be monitored.Howard Crenshaw, a UGA alumni, is pro Second Amendment, but even he is a bit wary about having guns at tailgates.


 


“I’ve seen too many fights at tailgates to back any law that allows guns,” Crenshaw said. “Way too many emotions occur at tailgates.”Fans used to be able to park their vehicles in UGA lots the Friday night before the game to ensure they got the parking spaces they wanted. Now, with the implementation of the Gamday Gameplan—UGA’s new program with the purpose of maintaining order during home football games—parking is not allowed until 7 a.m. on the Saturday of the game, according to the Gameday Gameplan website.Crenshaw will be the first to reminisce about the “good ole’ days” of tailgating in Athens.“We used to go down to our tailgate spot after work on Friday, and park at least two vehicles there to make sure we got our usual parking spot,” Crenshaw said. “Tailgating is nothing like it used to be in Athens, so many new rules take the fun out of it.”While alcohol is allowed on campus during tailgates, the laws have become somewhat stricter during those times. There are now 17 streets that run through campus where alcohol is not allowed, and if you are caught with an alcoholic beverage you will be ticketed, according to the Gameday Gameplan website.Michelle Williamson, a long-time UGA fan, thinks the police are devoting all of their attention on the policing of alcohol on game days.“I was at a tailgate [last year], and it’s weird, but since we were tailgating on private property, we could have alcohol. But someone stepped on the street, and the cops immediately pulled over and gave them a ticket,” Williamson said. “There are so many other things the cops should be policing instead of someone stepping onto a sidewalk with a beer in their hand.”Tailgating is a tradition that started to bring fans together; a way for everyone to celebrate their favorite team as one big, happy family. Unfortunately, it’s no longer thought of as harmless fun. Now, tailgating is a time that must be heavily policed. The safety of the fans comes first, but tailgating just won’t be the same.

2-Aug-17,Devonte Wyatt set to enroll at Hutchinson Community College,"Devonte Wyatt has finally enrolled in college, but that college is not the University of Georgia.Wyatt, the final member of Georgia’s 2017 recruiting class who has not joined the team, will instead play this season at Hutchinson Community College in Hutchinson, Kansas, according to Dawgs247 writer Kipp Adams.According to Adams, Hutchinson head coach Rion Rhoades said Wyatt’s test scores were responsible for keeping him out of Athens, and Rhoades called the situation “up in the air.”


 


For this season, Wyatt will be playing on the same team as former Georgia recruit D’Antne Demery, who was released from his national letter of intent following a domestic violence incident that occurred in Athens.If Wyatt can work through the issues of his academic eligibility, he could enroll at Georgia in the spring, which is apparently the four-star defensive lineman’s intention.""I definitely know he is going to Georgia when he is done here, either after one season or two seasons,"" Rhoades said, according to Adams.",Nathan Berg | Senior Staff Writer,sports,https://www.redandblack.com/sports/devonte-wyatt-set-to-enroll-at-hutchinson-community-college/article_dac71352-77bf-11e7-ad20-bbdb838568d3.html
2-Aug-17,Lamont Gaillard transitioning into leadership role on offensive line in 2017,"Lamont Gaillard takes pride in where he’s from.The Georgia offensive lineman grew up in Fayetteville, North Carolina, about three hours east of Charlotte. It’s the same town that produced the famous rapper J. Cole.“I take a lot of pride in it,” Gaillard said. “I love Fayetteville, and I follow him a lot.”


 


After an up-and-down year for Georgia’s offensive line in 2016, Gaillard is hoping he can take a bit more pride in the team’s blocking in 2017.He’s not alone in his feelings. He’s seen a noticeable difference in the group’s attitude as a whole heading into this season.“We want it more,” Gaillard said. “We all think that we have a chance to better.”To bolster its offensive line, Georgia brought in four highly-touted recruits in 2017 — Netori Johnson, Justin Shaffer, Andrew Thomas and Isaiah Wilson. Junior college transfer D’Marcus Hayes joined the group as well.From what Gaillard has seen so far, the new guys are bringing it, especially with their energy.“They’re working,” Gaillard said. “They all came to work. They all came with a positive mindset. They keep that up, and we’ll be good.”As the projected starter at center and one of the oldest players on Georgia’s offensive line, much of the responsibility for leading the group in the locker room and on the field has fallen on Gaillard’s shoulders.It’s been a major transition for someone whose high school coach once described as a “quiet leader” on the team. He can’t simply show up and do his job anymore. Well, he can, but his job now involves being a vocal leader for the rest of the Bulldogs’ offensive linemen.


 


Nevertheless, Gaillard feels he’s made the adjustment just fine.“I believe that I got a lot better,” Gaillard said. “I speak out more. I get everybody on the right track.”Gaillard’s role as a leader isn’t the only change he’s had to go through recently, though.As a redshirt sophomore in 2016, Gaillard started all 13 games for the Bulldogs. However, he started every game at right guard, not center.With the graduation and departure of Brandon Kublanow, Georgia’s coaches made the decision to slide Gaillard one spot over from right guard to center.That’s why Gaillard worked with the first-team group as center during spring practices. He did a good job, doing enough to be named the offense’s most improved player for spring 2017.When September comes around and the Bulldogs take the field for the first time in 2017, Gaillard won’t be nervous about his new position. He’ll be suited up and ready to snap the ball to Jacob Eason.“I’m confident,” Gaillard said. “I’m comfortable.”

14-Aug-17,"OPINION: Five-day syllabus week gives students time to adjust schedules, acclimate to campus climate","As another academic year rolls in, students across campus prepare for a week full of reviewing syllabi, making last-minute adjustments to schedules and getting back into the swing of classes.A full, five-day first week, also called syllabus week, is crucial for students and professors in the collegiate environment. It allows students and professors to adapt to new people and new course loads before the normal grind sets in.  Students can take advantage of syllabus week by adding or dropping classes, buying textbooks and acclimating to campus. Add/drop week “allows [students] to make mid-course corrections and to remedy faulty selections by canceling some courses and selecting other courses,” wrote Elisha Babad of Research in Higher Education. Syllabus week can act like a fail-safe in this way.


 


Professors benefit from syllabus week by making “use of this period to market their courses,” Babad said. Both students and professors can stay flexible with their coursework and test the waters of a new semester, ultimately providing a useful tool for everyone.Students and professors can interact with one another on a level playing field during syllabus week before many assignments are given. Syllabus week offers students “an opportunity to develop the feeling that they are an important part of the group and have a significant role to play,” according to the National Science Teachers Association. This mindset leads to a healthier student-teacher relationship overall.Syllabus week allows students and professors to tweak the syllabus in terms of course materials, making it a useful time to figure out which books are necessary. Extra time allows students to ship their books, and many online sites have cheaper prices than local bookstores.Most importantly, syllabus week allows students to acclimate to the culture on campus, especially first-years and transfers. Due to syllabus week’s relatively light course load, students may experiment with more organizations, which will acclimate them better to the particular campus climate.This allows newcomers and returners to interact, allowing for “peer-group interpersonal communication,” which Walter L. Wallace claims is the most important aspect of college freshmen socialization in the American Journal of Sociology. This interaction may still occur during the semester, but when courses pick up steam and schedules become more rigid, the interactions are less effective.Many students dislike syllabus week because it discourages teachers from assigning work that allots them valuable knowledge, but it is exactly this reason that syllabus week works effectively. The instability of the classes and the time spent on rules and regulations allows students to prepare themselves for the semester ahead. Without syllabus week, some students might feel confused and stressed.While you sit in class and listen to the third professor of the day go over grading rubrics and other minutia, know that syllabus week is more important than lectures. It is valuable time for adjustment and acclimation.",Asher Beckner | Contributor,opinion,https://www.redandblack.com/opinion/opinion-five-day-syllabus-week-gives-students-time-to-adjust/article_d26fe918-807f-11e7-a97b-5f3b404e2b57.html
14-Aug-17,6 tips for living off-campus in Athens,"For most university students, freshmen year is the first and last year spent in on-campus housing. Leaving the dorms behind creates great freedom, however, it also creates great responsibility. If you are one of the many upperclassmen planning to live in an off-campus apartment this semester, here are six tips to help with the transition into apartment living.1. Befriend your roommatesWhile you most likely won’t have to share a room like in the dorms, you will still have fairly constant contact with your fellow apartment dwellers, so it’s never a bad idea to be on good terms with them. If you need to, set guidelines and confront issues before they get out of control. Open communication, through weekly meetings or communal message boards, will make your living situation infinitely more comfortable and efficient.


 


2. Make schedulesBetween rent payments, utility payments, household chores and class , there’s a lot to forget. Creating different charts and schedules with your roommates can help you keep track of what needs to get done when.Use apps like Venmo or Cash for payments or subtle reminders for the forgetful roommates.3. Think about transportationOne of the downsides of living off campus is that your classes and favorite campus study spots are no longer within walking distance. Budgeting time for a car ride can be difficult, but if you coordinate your class schedule with roommates or neighbors, a carpool schedule can easily be arranged. Having a group of people to help remind you of transportation time will keep you from being late to class or skipping them too often.Popular Apartments in Athens  The Reserve, located in East Athens on College Station Road near Kroger and Blind Pig Tavern.  The Park, has a hillside as well as a lakeside location on Riverbend Parkway and Lakeside Drive, respectively.  The Lodge of Athens is close to campus and downtown Athens, it offers only 2-bedroom options.   4. Take advantage of amenitiesMost apartment complexes offer an onsite gym, free printing or even a pool to residents. Because rent covers these additional amenities, get as much as you can out of them. You already paid for them, so you might as well enjoy them as much as you can.5. File maintenance orders


 


As with amenities, most on-site maintenance is included in payments already made to the apartment complex. Because of this, there’s no reason your unit shouldn’t be in perfect working order. From leaky faucets and loose hinges to broken fixtures and malfunctioning appliances, don’t hesitate to call and have it fixed.6. Utilize appsTechnology is here to help with all aspects of first-time apartment living. Where transportation is concerned, there are plenty of ride-sharing apps for carpoolers and Google Maps for those who want to route the buses. Apps like Flipp and Pocket Points offer you deals and coupons for businesses around town. Downloading your bank account’s app will place your finances at your fingertips. Hundreds of other applications and programs exist to smooth your transition from on campus to off.",Gemma DiCarlo,culture,https://www.redandblack.com/culture/tips-for-living-off-campus-in-athens/article_fd2f2036-809f-11e7-83be-57c7046775e8.html

16-Aug-17,"OPINION: Regardless of major, UGA students should add a foreign language","For years, students have been required to learn different languages throughout their school career. At UGA, there are only a few more requirements to fulfill different degrees and colleges, but that doesn’t mean students should stop their language studies there. Many students have the false notion that their majors aren’t compatible with foreign languages.The benefit of a foreign language ranges from opportunities to health benefits. All students should consider keeping up with their foreign language. According to a Modern Language Association report in 2013, the enrollment for popular languages, like Spanish, are dropping.Many believe that if they are in STEM fields, foreign language knowledge becomes irrelevant. STEM and foreign language are a deeply connected field, according to Dr. Bill Rivers, the Executive Director for the Joint National Committee for Languages. Georgia Tech’s Ivan Allen College of Arts offers a Bachelor’s of Science in three types of Spanish majors: Applied Languages and Intercultural Studies, Global Economics and Modern Languages, International Affairs and Modern Languages.


 


Top Foreign Languages Studied in the U.S. 1. Spanish — Enrollment, 7.3 million persons  2. French — Enrollment, 1.2 million persons  3. German — Enrollment, 330,898 persons 4. Chinese — Enrollment, 227,086 persons  5. Latin — Enrollment, 210,306 persons  6. ASL — Enrollment, 130,411 persons  7. Japanese — Enrollment, 67,909 persons  8. Arabic — Enrollment, 26,045 persons  9. Russian — Enrollment, 14,876 Source: American Councils for International Education  American Council for the Teaching of Foreign Languages Center for Applied Linguistics: The National K-12 Foreign Language Enrollment Survey (2017) Tech offers a Bachelor’s of Science instead of a Bachelor’s of Arts for a foreign language because of the benefits students in STEM fields will have when applying their language skills to STEM concepts. Students will be able to work in cybersecurity firms, foreign consulates that discuss STEM topics (like agricultural techniques) and other opportunities that involve foreign countries and the sciences.This does not mean that UGA should follow this system, but students in STEM fields should look into the benefits of adding a language to their schedules, as it will open up new doors. A foreign language allows a glimpse into a different culture, which is helpful for any degree.College students who maintain a foreign language increase opportunities regardless of what field they study. Businesses across the globe look for workers that have foreign language backgrounds as they can branch out companies, deal with certain clients and bring in more business.""A foreign language allows a glimpse into a different culture, which is helpful for any degree.""Study abroad programs also open up opportunities. The ability to speak the language of the country you are studying can help you to better learn and interact with a culture. 


 


Lastly, the health benefits show that learning a foreign language can help your brain function better. A foreign language can increase your intellectual capacity, build your multitasking skills and prevent diseases like Dementia and Alzheimer’s. With UGA’s foreign language resources at our disposal, it doesn’t hurt to take a couple more than the required number of classes. The language knowledge will prove useful for all students.",Anila Yoganathan | Contributor,opinion,https://www.redandblack.com/opinion/opinion-regardless-of-major-uga-students-should-add-a-foreign/article_6d31fe5a-8206-11e7-9a32-f784aa32a10e.html
17-Aug-17,OPINION: Stand for Charlottesville in Athens,"White supremacy is a disease. The recent violence in Charlottesville should serve as a wake-up call.

Speak out for Charlottesville before similar problems arrive in Athens.Speaking out is vital since language plays a key role in the Charlottesville tragedy. James Alex Fields Jr. is the man suspected of driving into the counterprotestors. Fields told his mother, Samantha Bloom, that he was going to an alt-right rally.

I thought it had something to do with Trump,” Bloom said in an interview with a CNN affiliate station Toledo Blade.There is immense confusion about what to call this group of white supremacists. Alt-right and neo-nazi are just a few terms. Confusing language muddles a toxic message and hides the malicious intent of white supremacy groups.“We condemn in the strongest possible terms this egregious display of hatred, bigotry and violence, on many sides,” said Trump in a statement on Aug 12.Trump later made a second statement with a stronger stance against specific groups, but he still remains too passive because he doesn’t recognize his own role in the rise of white supremacy in 2016-2017.KKK and white supremacy groups do not deny their support and appreciation of what Trump has enabled their groups to do. By taking a passive stand on racism, other groups feel comfortable spreading their hatred.“We are going to fulfill the promises of Donald Trump. That’s what we believed in, that’s why we voted for Donald Trump,” said KKK leader David Duke.


 


Recent violence in Charlottesville cannot help but seem like a rallying cry for spreading hatred. There are historians hypothesizing about a new civil war. Robin Wright from the New Yorker spoke with Kevin Mines, a member of the U.S. Army Special Forces, the United Nations, and the State Department. Mines has witnessed civil wars in a variety of countries and has a theory for how civil wars take root.“Mines cited five conditions that support his prediction: entrenched national polarization, with no obvious meeting place for resolution; increasingly divisive press coverage and information flows; weakened institutions, notably Congress and the judiciary; a sellout or abandonment of responsibility by political leadership; and the legitimization of violence as the “in” way to either conduct discourse or solve disputes,” wrote Wright.There is fiery hatred from all sides, not just from the alt-right. This violence is not the first time we’ve seen hatred blossom into something worse. We need to eradicate the idea that the United States is above violence, wars and instability. Charlottesville is the United States in which we live. We can no longer pretend like these events have no effect. If we wait, it will be too late.We can no longer pretend like these events have no effect. If we wait, it will be too late.In a press conference with Donald Trump, he mentions the alt-left.“What about the ‘alt-left’ that came charging at, as you say, the ‘alt-right’? Let me ask you this: What about the fact they came charging—that they came charging with clubs in their hands, swinging clubs? Do they have any problem? I think they do,” Trump said.

Despite multiple first-hand accounts that detail what happened in Charlottesville, Trump blames the ""alt-left"" largely for the events that unfolded. The alt-left in actuality doesn’t exist. The term arose by the alt-right to make it seem like the maleficent equal to the alt-right. While alt-righters regularly accept and even coined their own name, no one from the liberal left calls themselves “alt-left.” Toying with language in this way diverts blame away from themselves and makes it appear as though the left holds just as much blame for racist, sexist and xenophobic words and actions.Charlottesville is not a standalone event. White supremacy is thriving everywhere, and with too much silence they will continue to thrive. The protest at the arch downtown in response to Charlottesville was only the beginning of a long line of necessary outcries. The people of Athens must continue to raise their voices and call for change.",Jaime Conlan | Opinion Editor,opinion,https://www.redandblack.com/opinion/opinion-stand-for-charlottesville-in-athens/article_7e067d1e-82ec-11e7-89b7-d30617cc82c3.html
18-Aug-17,OPINION: Cellular agriculture is the future of meat,"Imagine America without steaks grilling on the Fourth of July or turkeys baking in the oven on Thanksgiving. Meat consumption is so ingrained in our society that there’s no wonder it is a $750 billion industry annually.Despite the economic benefit, the meat industry has disastrous tolls on our environment. According to the United States Environmental Protection Agency, the livestock industry is the primary emitter of methane, a greenhouse gas 25 times more powerful than CO2. It also uses 26 percent of the world’s land for grazing and causes 80 percent of deforestation in the Amazon rainforest region. Meat production is unsustainable and will not be able to meet future meat demands if it continues with current techniques.That’s why we need cellular agriculture to fulfill our meat demands while reducing its impacts on the environment. If you are a meat eater, consider lab-grown meat as an alternative to your protein needs.


 


 With advancing technology, meat can be made in a lab using recombinant DNA. New Harvest, a nonprofit organization urging breakthroughs in cellular agriculture, describes this process as taking a microbe such as yeast and inserting the genetic blueprint for a protein into the microbe’s genetic makeup. Since all cells read the same genetic code, the microbe makes the protein the same as if it came from the cow cell. As more microbes produce more protein, you get tissues of meat that are identical to that actually grown on the animal.The result of this meat is that it requires much less time and resources than growing the entire animal itself. It is a revolutionarily clean way of getting meat that is healthier for humans, better for the environment and requires no animal slaughter.However, of course, the technology is new. The process is expensive, and it takes a long time for scientists to produce the meat. But as with computers and cell phones, technology becomes more efficient as it progresses, and there will come a day when we see lab-grown meat line our grocery store shelves.It will be a fruitless effort to save the environment and revolutionize our meat-production if people aren’t on board. Once the newness dies down, the benefits won’t be so hard to swallow.


 


Start-up companies such as Hampton Creek and Memphis Meats hope to be the first ones to bring lab-grown meat to store shelves in 2018 and 2021, respectively.The way we understand meat consumption and production as we know it is changing rapidly, and we as consumers will need to adjust our mindsets in order for major environmental change to occur. It is because of us our purchasing power that the current unsustainable meat industry thrives, and it will be up to us to change it.We desperately need to uphold the benefits of lab-grown meat despite its formidable novelty, for we will be the generation that makes or breaks the industry. It will be a fruitless effort to save the environment and revolutionize our meat-production if people aren’t on board. Once the newness dies down, the benefits won’t be so hard to swallow.",Mariah Manoylov | Contributor,opinion,https://www.redandblack.com/opinion/opinion-cellular-agriculture-is-the-future-of-meat/article_cd06a4da-83c2-11e7-81b9-d372420ef565.html
19-Aug-17,OPINION: Eliminate period stigma at UGA,"Period stigma has become part of a woman’s daily life, and on a college campus in America, this stigma can manifest in different forms. Colleges are working to fight the stigma and the ignorance surrounding periods. Some are providing free products for women in campus bathrooms. A University of North Carolina student created a video game called Tampon Run to normalize the concept. However, the physical side-effects of periods are a basic part of period stigma that directly affect women in the work industry and college classes.According to WebMD, side-effects can range from cramps and vomiting to fainting. The most well-known are cramps, or dysmenorrhea. While some women may face little pain, many others do not. A study about the prevalence of dysmenorrhea in college students stated that around 84 percent of women between the ages of 18 to 25 faced dysmenorrhea, of which 34 percent reported severe pain. The Independent states that period cramps can reach the same pain level as heart attacks.


 


Many women have had to leave class and skip events. If we want to normalize the idea of menstruation we must all understand that cramps and other side-effects are part of periods. Female students shouldn’t have to feel ashamed or face scrutiny from men and even other women.There has been much contemplation of paid period leaves in the news. A Washington Post writer commented that in India the idea is considered stupid, while Italy decided to try it out. The writer for the Post fears that women will be regarded as unequal but fails to acknowledge that not all women can get through their periods without severe side-effects that can prevent them from doing their jobs.“I definitely feel like paid leave for periods would help a lot of people in the workplace, especially since a lot of women I know just use their sick days when their periods are really bad. Not every woman has this option because some places make you have a doctor’s note,” said MaKenzie Cartwright, a sophomore communications major at Eckerd College.Women on all campuses, including UGA, have had to either leave or skip class because of period side-effects. If we want to eliminate the period stigma we should not shame women for period side-effects. Women students shouldn’t have to provide a doctor’s note to their professors for a natural bodily function that can be debilitating.Inevitably there will be women who have to take time off from classes and work. We need to be mindful of their pain and suffering. In the workforce, women should be allowed days off for their period, and women in college should have excused absences for the same reason.",Anila Yoganathan | Contributor,opinion,https://www.redandblack.com/opinion/opinion-eliminate-period-stigma-at-uga/article_972c3f06-8439-11e7-84b4-4368908ac38c.html
21-Aug-17,Three future Gymdogs compete at elite national championships,"As the Gymdogs settled into their fall classes last week, a few of the team’s future members competed in their most important meet of the year — the national championships for U.S. elite gymnasts.Three athletes who will represent Georgia at the NCAA level in the coming years competed at the P&G Championships in Anaheim, California, this weekend. Marissa Oakley, who will join the Gymdogs for the 2018 season that begins in January, took part in what is likely her final elite competition before she shifts her focus toward NCAA.In addition to Oakley, Abi Walker, who will start her collegiate career for the 2020-2021 school year, competed as a senior, while the other future Gymdog, Audrey Davis, took part in the junior competition. Davis will also begin her time at Georgia in 2020, but she is eight months younger than Walker, placing her in the younger division of competitors.


 


Davis was the only gymnast of the trio who competed all four events, and she was named to the U.S. junior national team.Marissa OakleyAfter dealing with multiple injuries throughout the last few years, Oakley reappeared on the elite scene in 2017. Before the U.S. Classic in July, Oakley had not competed at that level since 2014.This weekend, Oakley performed on just vault and bars, but both routines showed the potential to score well in the NCAA world that she will dive into in a few months. Oakley’s club teammate, Emily Schild, is already in Athens and is also a freshman this year.On bars at the P&G Championships, Oakley tied for third, among a field of gymnasts that included two of the alternates for the 2016 Olympics. Oakley averaged a 14.2 across the two days of competition, which took place on Friday and Sunday.Oakley concluded her bars routine with a double-twisting double tuck, one of the hardest dismounts in the entire competition. Even with a routine much more difficult than the one she will compete in college, Oakley still showed clean form throughout all of her skills.Oakley competed a full-twisting Yurchenko, which is a simple vault at the elite level but is a common skill in the NCAA. Particularly if she can eliminate the hop she had on the landing, Oakley could be in contention for a spot in Georgia’s vault lineup in January.


 


 Audrey DavisDavis hails from the same club as many gymnastics greats, including 2004 Olympic champion Carly Patterson and 2008 Olympic champion Nastia Liukin.As a somewhat new elite gymnast, Davis had a consistent meet, hitting all eight of her routines and finishing sixth in the all-around.Davis placed fourth on bars in a routine where her legs hardly ever come apart. That quality will serve her well at the NCAA level, where execution is the judges’ emphasis, rather than difficulty.Davis’ club, World Olympic Gymnastics Academy, has a long history of having gymnasts on Georgia’s roster. Senior Hayley Sanders, who competed on bars and beam for the Gymdogs last season, trained at the Texas club, and so did Ashlyn Broussard, who graduated after the 2017 season.

That trend will continue, as WOGA’s Rachel Baumann will join the Gymdogs in 2019, and Davis will become part of the team in 2020. Abi WalkerWalker competed vault, bars and beam at the P&G Championships. Walker trains at Texas Dreams Gymnastics, the same club that produced former Gymdog Chelsea Davis.Walker struggled on beam at the meet, falling on both days of the competition. She had solid performances on vault and bars both days, but she doesn’t have as high as difficulty as do most of the other senior competitors.",Emily Giambalvo | Senior Staff Writer,sports,https://www.redandblack.com/sports/gymnastics/three-future-gymdogs-compete-at-elite-national-championships/article_b0a21eb6-8622-11e7-b14c-2bedb3fff642.html
22-Aug-17,OPINION: The pros of protesting,"Protesters are a common sight on the University of Georgia campus, often congregating near the Arch to make speeches about topics which they find valuable. Last year, some protests focused on topics including campus carry, the presidential inauguration and the Dakota Access Pipeline.Campus protests in the past have had significant effects on the national legislative climate. According to the New York Times, “student protests at U.C. Berkeley helped elect Ronald Reagan as governor in 1966, and the anti-war and anti-draft protests did a great deal.”Protests are effective on all sides of the political spectrum. Stan A. Veuger of the American Enterprise said that, “higher attendance at individual demonstrations correlated with more conservative voting by congressional members and a greater share of Republican votes in the 2010 election.”


 


Most importantly, protests are important for students to engage in political movements and make their voices heard.“[Protests] are a public forum in the streets where different groups can have discussions and show outright public support,"" said India Hodo, a sophomore entertainment and media studies major. ""I think they are central to democracy and go back in this country a very long time.”They also publicize one’s beliefs in a way that is impossible without physical protests. When one attends a protest, their values are showcased: they stand up in the limelight to support a cause. This visibility brings a new perspective to students, and allows them to evaluate their beliefs with the context of visibility.Students must feel deeply about the events in which they participate, because protesting is a serious event. Photographic evidence is often taken at protests and may be visible to future employers online. Students must ask themselves “What do I want to be seen doing? Where do I want to stand in this time in history?”Not only do protests assist the political climate and create change in the system, but they allow students a stepping-stone into evaluating the issues about which they truly care. No matter the cause, protests are an effective and meaningful way for students to communicate on UGA campuses.",Asher Beckner | Contributor,opinion,https://www.redandblack.com/opinion/opinion-the-pros-of-protesting/article_34dd85f2-86e2-11e7-bc4a-23c7480e64a2.html
23-Aug-17,OPINION: Georgia should not strive for increased military spending,"The United States is a leader in defense military spending, spending over $600 billion per year. Part of this reason is America’s persistence in claiming to be a world leader to combat terrorism.Increased military funding and increased U.S. presence abroad are not goals for which we should strive. We can face these problems by taking a closer look at what happens at the local level, right here in Georgia.Increased military funding is largely a conservative goal, although not entirely. Public opinion on military funding varies widely. According to Republicanviews.org, however, the reason many republicans tout unending support for high military budgets is due to the belief that the budget for military will help solve some of the challenges related to “readiness, morale, and its ability to prepare for threats of the future.”


 


In July, when the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) passed (and authorized nearly $700 billion for fiscal year 2018), it was no surprise that Republican representative for Georgia’s 10th congressional district Jody Hice was in favor of the bill.“We need to bolster our military capabilities – not further degrade them,” Hice said. “This year’s NDAA gains ground in our efforts to close the readiness gap by modernizing and fully funding our Armed Forces, while developing an effective framework to counter terrorism.”The focus on terrorism is also excessive. Terrorism is a problem, but many other problems also exist which are being ignored in favor of a bloated military budget. Education reform, poverty, homelessness and affordable healthcare are only a few of the issues that will receive less focus than the military. Of course allocating money for the military is important, but it’s questionable why each year there seems to be another reason to increase military spending.On Aug. 21, President Trump announced in a speech to troops in Virginia that he plans to deepen American involvement in the war in Afghanistan. Although he didn’t specify numbers or give out precise details, his wants for increased military action are clear.Virginia is the top state in terms of defense spending, and Georgia ranks in the top 10 according to the National Conference of State Legislature. While military spending does generally help state economies by creating local jobs, that fact alone should not take precedence over other options. The state government can create sustainable jobs in other ways than military. A focus on defense spending means cuts from other important departments that could also create jobs and economic benefit for the state and country as a whole.Overall, Georgia’s defense spending is not a bad thing. It aids our state economy in many ways, and it plays a part in how America as a whole is able to handle potential security threats. The problem arises when we continuously boost the money being allocated for defense spending without considering other possibilities that may be more beneficial.",Jaime Conlan | Opinion Editor,opinion,https://www.redandblack.com/opinion/opinion-georgia-should-not-strive-for-increased-military-spending/article_fae05418-879c-11e7-8167-fb52b0c60de0.html
24-Aug-17,LETTER TO THE EDITOR: Liberal left also to blame for divisive hatred,"Guest ColumnGuest columnist Ross Dubberly takes a slightly different perspective from the one The Red & Black's Opinion Editor Jaime Conlan presented in her piece on the violence that ensued in Charlottesville after an alt-right and white supremacist protest on Aug. 12. Last week, The Red & Black published a piece by its opinion editor, Jaime Conlan, in which Ms. Conlan admirably condemned the recent violence committed by white supremacists in Charlottesville, Virginia. On the subject of white supremacists and the alt-right, Ms. Conlan and I are in complete agreement that they are morally repugnant. In her column, however, Ms. Conlan did a bit more than condemn those responsible for violence in Charlottesville. From that heinous event, she made a number of assumptions she wasn’t entitled to make.“We don’t have to scroll past the news stories, refusing to recognize a detrimental flaw in society,” Conlan said.


 


That sentence is an example of over-generalization at its worst. Charlottesville does not demonstrate a “detrimental flaw” in American society. It demonstrates a detrimental flaw in white supremacy. Small groups such as American neo-Nazis and white supremacists are not representative of society as a whole.Ms. Conlan fails to identify Trump’s contributions to the rise of white supremacy, despite mentioning his passivity and indifference towards the movement as a whole.“By taking a passive stand on racism, other groups feel comfortable spreading their hatred,” Conlan said.I find the notion that the KKK’s activities are attributable to President Trump’s “passive stand on racism” to be nonsensical.For if this is true, then by the same token, responsibility for the neo-Nazis intending to march through the predominantly Jewish community of Skokie, Illinois in 1977 should be laid at the feet of then-President Jimmy Carter.I also object to Ms. Conlan’s take on today’s political “hate” which I find to be misguided. Nearly all political hate and violence emanate from the left.Leftists harassed, spat upon, robbed and assaulted Trump supporters outside of a Trump rally in June 2016.Madonna, at the Women’s March in January, said she had “thought an awful lot about blowing up the White House.”


 


In May, Kathy Griffin posed with a bloody severed Trump head.Leftists at Middlebury College disrupted a talk by libertarian sociologist, Charles Murray, and assaulted a professor with whom he was supposed to talk.To “protest” the scheduled speech of Milo Yiannopoulos at UC-Berkeley, campus leftists caused $100,000 worth of property damage and attacked two Berkeley College Republicans. The examples do not end there.I would like to end this column as I started it, in agreement with Ms. Conlan. In her final paragraph she speaks of the nonexistence of the alt-left. She is quite right. Right-wing aggression is rare and often attributable to demented fringe groups like the alt-right. Meanwhile, the hate, intolerance and violence of the left-wing is mainstream.The alt-left may be nonexistent, but the liberal left as a whole is frightening in its intolerance.",Ross Dubberly | Guest Columnist,opinion,https://www.redandblack.com/opinion/letter-to-the-editor-liberal-left-also-to-blame-for/article_3564c372-884b-11e7-9c27-ef64a97605e8.html
25-Aug-17,OPINION: Save statues to preserve history,"The riots in Charlottesville, VA have sparked controversy in the news. The riots have turned deadly and dangerous after white supremacist groups have taken what was a designated protest, and turned it into a murderous, vengeful act of hatred. The riots centered around a statue of Robert E. Lee which has inspired many to call for its removal. However, the statue is nothing more than a statue. Removing the statue will not save long-standing problems.Many individuals feel the statue stands to commemorate slavery and the mistreatment of an entire race of people. While slavery is one component, all of the blame cannot be cast on one man and his stone statue.Other Confederate symbols have been wrongfully stirring up controversy. Georgia is home to Stone Mountain, a 1,686 foot mountain. Stone Mountain portrays three important figures from the Confederacy. The front of the mountain is faced with a carving of Jefferson Davis, Robert E. Lee and Stonewall Jackson. The removal of the carving is now being pushed yet again after the recent riots in Charlottesville.

The carvings in the side of Kennesaw's Stone Mountain are figures of the confederacy including Robert E Lee. 


Another area being affected by the riots is Duke University in North Carolina. There are ongoing investigations being conducted at Duke after a statue of Robert E. Lee was vandalized twice over the past week.People all around the country are beginning to act out in vengeance and hate, yet all these actions prove are the lack of unity within our country. The removal of memorials put in place years ago to commemorate a time in history would do nothing.Robert E. Lee is an important person in American history regardless of the fact that he was a part of the Confederacy. The statue can be a different representation for each individual. To some it stands to remind them of a horrible time in American history, yet for others it commemorates a heritage. The fate of the statue still hangs in the balance.Lee himself disapproved of statues meant to commemorate people and their actions. Jonathan Horn, writer of Lee’s biography, spoke on Lee’s opinions towards commemorative statues.“It’s often forgotten that Lee himself, after the Civil War, opposed monuments, specifically Confederate war monuments,” Horn said.Lee wanted the war to be left in the past. He felt commemorative statues would not honor the war and it would only make for more issues for the South.


 


University of Georgia history professor, James Cobb, spoke out about what he thinks Robert E. Lee’s feelings would have been about the Confederacy and where he may stand today.“I don’t think that means he would have felt good about the people who fought for the Confederacy being completely forgotten,” Cobb said. “But he didn’t want a cult of personality for the South.”In light of recent protests, it seems that Lee may have been right by expressing his fear for the South. There have been attempts in the past to remove these “offensive” statues, yet they still remain. These statues represent a time in history, and for that reason they should not be removed. Americans have started looking for any excuse to act out, and the recent riots only prove that point.Regardless of one’s feelings towards the subject, it happened. History cannot and should not be erased. Americans need to unite and accept history as a thing of the past and move forward as a stronger, united country.",Lyndsey McElhannon | Contributor,opinion,https://www.redandblack.com/opinion/opinion-save-statues-to-preserve-history/article_88702710-8854-11e7-b25c-c3d161eb6d82.html
26-Aug-17,"OPINION: UGA should require a sex education course to compete with high school ""abstinence only"" policies","As the new class of freshmen move through their prerequisite classes of United States history, economics, pre-calculus and physical education, there is a subject that is not present or required at UGA: sex-education. To some students, this class might seem unnecessary and laughable as many have already had sex, but a sex-education course is still necessary in college.About 87 percent of UGA’s 2015 incoming freshman class are from Georgia, meaning that around 87 percent of these students have been subject to Georgia’s poor sex-education courses in their high school or middle school years. The South’s abstinence only motto is well known, but in Georgia specifically students are not receiving adequate sex-education.According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, an Atlanta-based organization, only around a third of Georgia’s high schools taught the 16 recommended sex-education topics. Topics involving the use of condoms were primarily underrepresented. WABE reports that Georgia ranked No. 5 in the nation in 2015 for AIDS/HIV diagnoses. These problems could be alleviated with better sex education.

It is clear that students are not receiving the proper sex-education in their high school and middle school years, but college can change that. Students who have already taken U.S. history or pre-calculus have to retake the class in college, unless they are exempt because of AP/IB credits. Requiring a sex-education course would be similar to these required courses, and could prove useful to make sure students understand the important information.Studies link the association of sex-education to safe sex and how that can prevent unplanned pregnancies and STIS. One study even states that the sexual culture on college campuses involves a good deal of male pressure, female unpreparedness, lack of communication and regret. A sex-education class could change this, because knowledge provides understanding and information that students could use before they make decisions.UGA has already taken a vested interest in the practices of safe sex on campus such as the creation of the Condom Express, which provides free condoms, dental dams, lubricant and other necessary items for safe sex.Furthermore, UGA also requires incoming students to take AlcoholEdu and Haven, online programs that teach students about the effects of alcohol, and sexual-violence. These programs could be a blueprint for a sex-education class, however it is worth noting that the online programs are limited. Most students want to finish them without actually learning the material, which could be counter-productive. It might be beneficial to combine these topics of alcohol education, sexual-violence and sexual education into an entire required class, so students will learn and pay attention to life valuing information.A sex-education course would provide understanding about the practices of safe-sex, the risks of pregnancy, differences of sexual orientation and the difference in reproductive organs between males and females. It would create a more open discussion of sexual activities. Knowledge can replace the various stigmas surrounding sexual activity.",Anila Yoganathan | Contributor,opinion,https://www.redandblack.com/opinion/opinion-uga-should-require-a-sex-education-course-to-compete/article_b93b7b36-89d7-11e7-bbab-036ba1b4ced2.html
29-Aug-17,Destination Dawgs participant to be on Times Square billboard,"Jordan Huffman, a University of Georgia student whose mother captured his excitement upon being accepted to UGA’s Destination Dawgs program in a video that went viral last year, has more news to be excited about.Huffman was selected to be featured in a video created by the National Down Syndrome Society that will run on a billboard in Times Square throughout the month of October, which is Down Syndrome Awareness Month. Huffman is looking forward to October.“I’m really, really, really, really excited,” he said.


 


The video is a part of National Down Syndrome Society’s Down Syndrome awareness campaign, which was created to “celebrate people with Down Syndrome and make people aware of our abilities and accomplishments,” the NDSS website said.Since his acceptance, Huffman has been participating in Destination Dawgs, an inclusive post-secondary education program for students with intellectual or developmental disabilities.Destination Dawgs brought its first class to UGA in January 2017 and is a non-degree certificate program that aims to help students with intellectual or developmental disabilities with the “transition to adulthood,” according J.W. Fanning Institute for Leadership Development website. The J.W. Fanning Institute teams up with Destination Dawgs for a summer leadership institute. Destination Dawgs works out of the Institute on Human Development and Disability in the College of Family and Consumer Sciences. The competitive program offers its participants an opportunity to prepare for a career and independent living over the course of five spring and fall semesters.Huffman and other participants attend UGA courses, gain job skills, have access to UGA email addresses and football tickets and build social networks based on individual plans supported by peer mentors, said Anna Lawrence, the Destination Dawgs program coordinator.“I love it [the Destination Dawgs Program] a lot,” Huffman said. “It’s a great program because I get to see all my friends from high school and hang out with all my mentors — they are really, really, really nice.”Adam Goodman, a junior Marketing major from Fayetteville, serves as one of Huffman’s peer mentors.“You can just tell the kids love it here, they love going to college just like any person would love going to college, and they love learning a lot,” Goodman said. “They get to meet good people too. The mentors have been awesome to them. It's a great experience for me and a great experience for them.”


 


According to the J.W. Fanning Institute for Leadership Development, the Destination Dawgs program was implemented after a 2013-2015 feasibility study on inclusive post-secondary education at UGA.However, UGA is not the only school that has a program for students with intellectual or developmental disabilities.“They are starting to open up more programs like this at different schools,” Goodman said. “It is important that kids with disabilities have the same opportunities as other kids to go to college.”There are currently 268 college programs in the U.S. for students with intellectual disabilities, according to Think College, a national organization that promotes inclusive higher education.Along with UGA, Kennesaw University, Georgia Southern University and Georgia Institute of Technology offer programs for students with intellectual disabilities.Clarification: A previous version of this article did not properly identify the distinction between Destination Dawgs and the J.W. Fanning Institute. It has since been clarified to show the relationship of the two. The J.W. Fanning Institute teams up with Destination Dawgs for a summer leadership institute.

31-Aug-17,Stegeman Bound: Georgia volleyball will have a new home later this season,"Since December of 2016, one theme has been a constant for the Georgia volleyball program: change.Following the resignation of former head coach Lizzy Stemke, the team announced in December that Tom Black would take over the head coaching duties. Since then, Black has completely changed the team’s style of play, increasing its pace of play in hopes of improving upon consecutive losing seasons for the Bulldogs.This fall, the theme of change will continue when the team makes the move from Ramsey Student Center, where Georgia volleyball has played its home matches since 1995, to Stegeman Coliseum, the current home of both men’s and women’s basketball as well as gymnastics.


 


“It’s an honor to play there,” Black said. “I think it will be exciting for the fans. It’s definitely exciting for recruits and for our players, and I think it’s definitely something that our program can grow into.”While there is no date set for the move to Stegeman, the team is expected to begin playing its home matches there once renovations on the arena are completed, which will likely be sometime around the beginning of October.

When he was interviewing for the head coaching position at Georgia, Black immediately learned that Stegeman would be available for volleyball games should he decide it was best for the program.“It’s definitely something that helped me see the future of the program,"" Black said. ""I think it’s a big piece of where we can go.""After hearing rumors about a possible move to Stegeman, the team first learned of the change at the first meeting with Black and his new coaching staff last year.""Everyone was freaking out in excitement about how it was going to be so different and cool,” said senior Cassidy Anderson. “Then we learned that Stegeman was going to get a brand new makeover, so that was even better.”Freshman Brynn Chandler, who was previously committed to play volleyball at the University of California, Berkeley, first learned of this change during her official visit to Georgia last March.


 


She said this news had a strong influence on her decision to commit to Georgia.“The other school that I was previously committed to had a big arena, and that created a lot of hype about playing there,” Chandler said. “Then when I came here, and they said, ‘[Ramsey] is just where we’re practicing, we’re going to play all our games in Stegeman,’ that just made it ten times more exciting.”With the new venue will come a large increase in capacity. While the volleyball arena in Ramsey Center holds only 1,925 people, Stegeman Coliseum holds 10,523.This drastic increase in capacity could make the crowds that generally attend volleyball matches seem smaller. But Black said he believes more people will come out to games in the new venue.“I think as the program grows, the crowds will grow also,” Black said.There is also the potential that more student athletes will attend volleyball matches after the move, since Stegeman is much closer to the other athletic facilities — such as the Rankin Smith Student-Athlete Academic Center and the Coliseum Training Facility attached to Stegeman.“A lot of the student athletes who are our closest friends have said that it’s going to be cool,” Anderson said. “Since Rankin is right there, all the student athletes can just walk over, so I feel like our student section is going to get bigger and bigger.”If the crowds do increase along with the change in venue, it could create a whole new environment, one that is much louder and has a potential effect on the team's performance. While this change could make some athletes nervous, Chandler said she thinks the change in environment will mainly make players more excited for games.

“It will make you a little more nervous playing in that environment, but I think that’s also a good thing to be able to adapt to new environments,” Chandler said.Anderson believes the change could also become a competitive advantage for the team when visiting teams come to play at Stegeman. Since many of the other teams in the SEC have large arenas like Stegeman, she has experienced the effects it can have on a visiting team.“I think when more people come, the atmosphere is going to be intense, and people won’t want to come play us in Stegeman, because the fans and the band and everything is going to freak them out,"" Anderson said.",Janey Murray | Contributor,sports,https://www.redandblack.com/sports/volleyball/stegeman-bound-georgia-volleyball-will-have-a-new-home-later/article_868dc034-8e61-11e7-9419-4bdfa69b8ff2.html

9-Sep-17,What happens when the all ex-Georgia player Madden team takes on all ex-Notre Dame?,"On Saturday, the Georgia football team will take on Notre Dame in South Bend. But what if the teams’ rosters were not restricted to merely the student-athletes who still have college football eligibility? What if the very best alumni of both Georgia and Notre Dame returned to team up with fellow former students at their respective alma maters, and faced off in an ultimate showdown of recent program dominance?It’s unlikely such a scenario would ever occur in real life, but fortunately, it doesn’t have to for us to see what might happen. Over the summer, the All-Georgia Madden team was forced to play a full NFL season.This week, the virtual Bulldogs only had to play one game, going up against the All-Notre Dame Madden team, in the ultimate test of which powerhouse program ranks above the other.


 


The Teams:Georgia Roster:Due to a technological upgrade from Madden 17 to Madden 18, the Georgia roster had to be completely recreated. This time around, the Bills would represent Georgia, while the Colts would stand in for Notre Dame. The new and improved All-Georgia squad featured some new faces as well as most of the familiar one’s from the previous game’s team. Matt Stafford and Todd Gurley are still at the helm of the offense, and Justin Houston and Charles Johnson still man the edges on the defensive side of the ball. NFL newcomer Isaiah McKenzie took over on kick and punt return duties. He is joined by rookies Greg Pyke as a reserve offensive lineman and Quincy Mauger waiting in the wings at defensive back.Offense:  Offensive reserves: Aaron Murray, Keith Marshall, Tavarres King, Marlon Brown, Greg PykeDefense: Defensive reserves: Jarius Wynn, DeMarcus Dobbs, John Jenkins, Cornelius Washington, Garrison Smith, Deangelo Tyson, Sterling Bailey, Kedric Golston, Toby Johnson, Chris Mayes, Jordan Jenkins, Alec Ogletree, Akeem Dent, Amarlo Herrera, Jarvis Jones, Dannell Ellerbe, Damian Swann, Corey Moore, Quincy MaugerSpecial Teams: Notre Dame Roster: The All-Notre Dame team’s strength is in its big men.The offensive line is a strong one, anchored by impressive second year tackle Ronnie Stanley at left tackle, but led by all-pro right guard Zach Martin of the Cowboys. The Fighting Irish are no slouches at tight end either, where Tyler Eifert and Kyle Rudolph hold things down. Theo Riddick, coming off a breakout year in the receiving game a season ago gets the start at running back. The biggest question mark for the team comes at quarterback, where like real life Georgia, All-Notre Dame is forced to turn to a rookie. DeShone Kizer has shown some promise in limited preseason action with the Browns, but will he be ready to lead this team against a stacked Georgia defensive front seven?All-Notre Dame is a tad weaker on the defensive side of the ball, but end Stephon Tuitt, linebackers Manti Te’o and Jaylon Smith, and safety Harrison Smith give the team impact players at all three levels of defense.Offense: Offensive Reserves: Jimmy Clausen, C.J. Prosise, Jonas Gray, George Atkinson III, Michael Floyd, T.J. Jones, Chris Brown, Troy Niklas, Ben Koyack, J.J. Jansen, Chris Watt, Trevor RobinsonDefense:

 Defensive Reserves: Kapron Lewis-Moore, Ishaq Williams, Isaac Rochell, Louis Nix III, Jarron Jones, Darius Fleming, Robert Blanton, Sergio Brown, Bennett Jackson, Matthias FarleySpecial Teams: The Pre-Game:The first thing we had to do was mess with some settings. First of all, the game will be played at Soldier Field, the closest NFL stadium to South Bend. We want conditions to be as close as they can possibly be to Georgia’s real life matchup against Notre Dame on Saturday. Neither All-Georgia nor All-Notre Dame were made with the Bears as their base teams, which is an admitted lack of foresight on this end. Luckily, however, if Madden is willing to let us tweak rosters to this extreme degree, I think it can make an exception to let the Bills and the Colts play in the Bears home stadium.Secondly, we’ll turn difficulty to All-Madden for both teams. We want this to be a good game after all, and not a sloppy, rookie-difficulty quality matchup. Finally, we will turn injuries all the way off. If Kizer were to get injured early in the contest, Notre Dame would be forced to turn to Jimmy Clausen. Likewise, if Stafford were to go down All-Georgia would need to play Aaron Murray. In an effort to keep the game as close as possible, it's probably best that both teams have all their top players throughout the contest.

The Game:Notre Dame won the opening coin toss and elected to receive the ball. With the union of Blair Walsh’s cleat and the oblong, leather projectile, the game was underway. All-Notre Dame came out committed to establishing a strong running game, and on its first drive, the technique was effective.On the third play from scrimmage, starting running back Theo Riddick took the handoff from DeShone Kizer, running down the right side of the field first before cutting back to his left. Riddick spun out of the tackle of Thomas Davis as he barreled down the middle of the field, taking the ball 65 yards for a go-ahead score.Not to be outshined, Matt Stafford led his team on a methodical drive down the field on the following drive, picking up a 3rd and 13 with a 27-yard strike to Malcolm Mitchell along the way. The possession was capped off with a 5-yard touchdown toss to A.J. Green, and the game was tied at 7-7.Then, the two teams’ defensive lines began to find a rhythm.Justin Houston and Charles Johnson sacked Kizer on the first two plays of the possession, ruining the drive before it really even got started. But All-Notre Dame struck back defensively, with a Stephon Tuitt sack on third down of All-Georgia’s ensuing drive. However, the Irish players got themselves into field goal range on the following possession, and a Matt Brindza kick gave All-Notre Dame the 10-7 advantage as the first quarter wound down.And that’s where things started to get interesting.All-Georgia quickly went three and out on its first possession of the second quarter, but a beautiful punt off the foot of Drew Butler pinned All-Notre Dame on its own one-yard line. On the first play of the Irish drive, defensive tackle Abry Jones burst through the line, cutting down Theo Riddick in the end zone for a safety, which brought the virtual Bulldogs to within one point of their opponents.

At this point, the All-Georgia players appeared to have finally figured out the fact that they were going up against Kizer, a rookie quarterback. With the All-Notre Dame virtual coach seemingly hesitant to throw the ball while holding onto a fragile lead, the Irish offense started to become more and more one-dimensional, as Riddick was fed the ball more and more often.All-Georgia forced another three and out, and then on the fourth play of the following drive, Gurley ran the ball in from 26 yards out against a worn down All-Notre Dame defense, giving the Bulldogs their first lead of the game. Further ineptitude from Kizer and some horrible punting from Brindza (Notre Dame has not put a punter in the NFL recently, so he was the only option) allowed Georgia to get into field goal range and extend the lead to 19-10.But just as things were looking bleak for All-Notre Dame, the Irish found a use for Brindza’s horrible punting ability. After failing to pick up a first down for the third straight drive, Brindza shanked a punt straight up into the air. The punt eventually came down and hit an unsuspecting Bacarri Rambo directly on the helmet, bouncing right into the waiting arms of C.J. Prosise on punt coverage.

The Irish offense was not good enough to get into the endzone with the excellent field position, but it did manage a field goal to stay in the game, losing 19-13 at this point.But it wasn’t enough to stem the tide which had assuredly turned in favor of the virtual Bulldogs.With less than two minutes to go until halftime, Stafford connected with Gurley and A.J. Green to get All-Georgia in striking distance. Then, from 35 yards away, he hit Mitchell on a crossing route. Mitchell appeared to be running out of bounds, but spun back towards the middle of the field to the dismay of a hapless Keivarae Russell, who has already apparently given up on the play. Mitchell then ran right up the middle of the field and stiff armed Jaylon Smith to the ground on the way to scoring the touchdown standing up, which extended All-Georgia’s lead to 26-13.Kizer still had about 30 second to make something happen before the end of the half, but he promptly threw an interception on the first play of his attempted 2-minute drill possession. The pick was far enough inside All-Notre Dame territory that the virtual Bulldogs managed to get another three points from the leg of Blair Walsh, finishing the half at 29-13

The All-Notre Dame team very well may have invited Rudy into its locker room to make a halftime speech, because the virtual Irish players came out for the second half fired up. After tackling Gurley behind the line of scrimmage to force a three and out on All-Georgia’s first possession, special teams standout C.J. Prosise broke through the line on the punt, blocking it and setting his team up on the All-Georgia 20.But QB issues continued to plague the losing squad.Kizer looked no more decisive than he did in the first half, getting sacked by Houston and Jones again, and pushing the team back far enough to where Brinda’s attempt came from 53 yards out. He did not have the leg to carry the ball to the goal post, and All-Georgia took over in favorable field position.As the half wore on, it became apparent that All-Notre Dame was completely out-matched. The offensive line, a unit which was comprised of entirely players with a 70 rating or hire, wilted under the pressure of All-Georgia’s elite front seven, giving up sack after sack.On the other side of the ball, All-Notre Dame’s defenders were completely gassed, missing tackle after tackle as All-Georgia started to feed Gurley more and more often in clock-killing mode.Gurley got into the endzone once more before the final whistle, but All-Notre Dame never even made it back into the redzone.All-Georgia finished off the game winning 39-13 in dominant fashion.Final Stats:

 Georgia Individual Leaders: Notre Dame Individual Leaders: 

Final thoughts:In much the same way that Georgia’s real life defensive line vs. Notre Dame’s real life offensive line is a matchup to watch come Saturday, it was certainly the difference in this game. All-Georgia’s powerful ends and tackles on the defensive side of the ball were too much for All-Notre Dame’s offensive line, which could not keep the pocket clean for Kizer. For his part, Kizer also looked terrible. He was not nearly as poised as Stafford, and his inexperience showed. Without a passing game to fall back on, Notre Dame’s offense quickly fell apart, and Georgia took over the game. Stafford’s sharpness in the west coast offense kept the Georgia offense on the field for much of the contest, and the Bulldogs were too much for the Irish to overcome.",Nathan Berg | Assistant Sports Editor,sports,https://www.redandblack.com/sports/football/what-happens-when-the-all-ex-georgia-player-madden-team/article_211d6eb4-94bc-11e7-9b04-e77a6dc1f556.html
20-Sep-17,Practice Report: Observations from third UGA practice before Mississippi State game,"The Georgia football team held a practice on Wednesday. Here are some observations as made by The Red & Black during the media viewing time.Jacob Eason was practicing once again on Wednesday. As the quarterbacks threw different routes to the wide receivers, Eason took reps behind Jake Fromm and Brice Ramsey.Running back Sony Michel and receiver Michael Chigbu were also practicing as full participants during the portion of practice open to the media.


 


Rashad Roundtree was seen practicing normally with the defensive backs, although he was wearing a black jersey, which typically signifies non-contact. The junior has been limited in practice so far this season, going through concussion protocol, head coach Kirby Smart said at a press conference on Monday. In 2016, Roundtree saw action in 12 games, making six tackles on the year.Other notes:  - Senior Malkom Parrish was seen practicing for the third straight day. The cornerback has not seen any playing time so far this season due to a broken foot. Head coach Kirby Smart has not said whether or not Parrish is expected to play Saturday against Mississippi State. - The offense spent the first part of the media viewing period practicing its “Wildcat” package. Mecole Hardman served as the primary quarterback, and Sony Michel and Brian Herrien both took a rep aligned beside Hardman in the backfield. On one play, Hardman was flanked by both Nick Chubb and D’Andre Swift.- As the offense ran through some of these plays, Kirby Smart took the opportunity to correct the footwork of a couple of his defensive linemen.-The starting offensive line remained the same, consisting of Isaiah Wynn (left tackle), Kendall Baker (left guard), Lamont Gaillard (center), Solomon Kindley (right guard) and Andrew Thomas (right tackle).",Jed May and Alex Soderstron,sports,https://www.redandblack.com/sports/football/practice-report-observations-from-third-uga-practice-before-mississippi-state/article_3f783454-9e42-11e7-aa82-b39189fd1965.html
20-Sep-17,Inexperienced right side of Georgia’s offensive line gears up for first SEC contest,"Technically, Saturday’s game against Mississippi State won’t be the first time redshirt freshman offensive lineman Solomon Kindley has appeared in a Southeastern Conference game.Kindley got in for his first and only play of 2016 last year against Missouri, a play that nearly cost him a year of eligibility until he was later granted a redshirt.“It was my first play,” Kindley said. “I remember it was very loud and they were very big and I was like, ‘Oh, I’m really here.’”


 


But Kindley will be playing a lot more than a single snap on Saturday. He, along with true freshman right tackle Andrew Thomas, will presumably be making their first SEC starts when the Bulldogs from Starkville, Mississippi, come to Athens.While it will be the first start against a conference foe for the pair, it won’t be their first overall action in college. Thomas has started all three games this season. Kindley appeared only on special teams in the season opener, but played some right guard against Notre Dame before starting last weekend against Samford.“I feel like its prepared them a lot,” senior left tackle Isaiah Wynn said. “Every game it’s evident that they just got better. They got better chemistry, they play off each other.”Health has also played a big part in that, as Wynn said Kindley getting back to full speed has helped improve the continuity of the two young Bulldogs on the right side of the line.Kindley and Thomas won’t get eased into things in their first SEC matchup. They will face off against a talented Mississippi State defensive line that has picked up seven sacks in its first three games against Charleston Southern, Louisiana Tech and LSU.The Bulldogs from the west are led by pass rusher Jeffery Simmons, who has accumulated 2.5 sacks so far on the season.“He’s a very good player,” Kindley said. “We know he’s a very good player, and we have to attack him like he’s a very good player. That’s really pretty much it.”Georgia does have the advantage of playing at home against Mississippi State as opposed to traveling to Starkville, Mississippi, with its infamous cowbells. Kindley said that doesn’t affect how he is preparing for this contest, but his memory of last year’s Missouri game shows that crowd noise can leave an impression.But he and Thomas won’t have that to worry about Saturday. They will only need to think about the same thing they’ve focused on all year: handing the man lined up across from them.“Appalachian State is a very good defensive team, then Notre Dame was a very good defensive team, then Samford was very good too,” Kindley said. “Our mindset is going in every game, dominate no matter who the name on the helmet it is.”",Jed May | Senior Staff Writer,sports,https://www.redandblack.com/sports/football/inexperienced-right-side-of-georgia-s-offensive-line-gears-up/article_e4714268-9e5e-11e7-93f9-5730c507d3fe.html
21-Sep-17,Nick Fitzgerald: The one who got away,"In the summer of 2013, Lyman Guy, then the head football coach for Richmond Hill High School just outside of Savannah, brought some of his players to a 7-on-7 camp held at the University of Georgia’s campus. While there with his team, Guy said the play of his rising senior quarterback, a then 6-foot-4 Fitzgerald, caught Georgia head coach Mark Richt’s eye.Richt approached Guy to talk about the relatively unknown pass-throwing prospect.“Coach, that’s a good looking kid you got there,” Guy remembers Richt saying.


 


Guy was stunned at Richt’s lack of familiarity with Fitzgerald so late in his high school career.“Yeah coach, I’ve been talking to y’all about him for over a year now,” Guy responded.On Sept. 23, Fitzgerald will be playing in Athens again, and this time Georgia’s football program could feel the pain of its failure to recruit him in the form of its first possible loss of the 2017 season when Mississippi State comes to town.

By the time Richt took notice of Fitzgerald, he had already committed to play for Mississippi State, and Guy said Fitzgerald is not the type to turn back once he’s made a decision. But Starkville, Mississippi, was never the destination Guy saw for his big, athletic quarterback.“I talked to Georgia coaches first cause Nick [Fitzgerald], he’s always dreamed of playing at Georgia,” Guy said.Guy’s campaign to make Fitzgerald a Bulldog began in the spring of the quarterback’s sophomore year. In Richmond Hill’s spring scrimmage, Guy saw Fitzgerald, a right-handed thrower, roll to his left, only to complete a pass 70 yards down the field.After that play, Guy said he knew Fitzgerald had the talent to play quarterback in the Southeastern Conference, and Georgia was the obvious top choice. Fitzgerald went to high school more than 200 miles away from Athens, but he had clear ties to the Classic City.“His father’s family and aunts and uncles and all that are from the Athens area,” Guy said.And while the pairing seemed like a no-brainer to Guy, Fitzgerald’s lack of experience was an obstacle to the recruiting process. With Dominique Allen, currently the starting quarterback for the Citadel, ahead of Fitzgerald on the depth chart, he didn’t have a lot of starting experience at quarterback.Instead, Fitzgerald had to fill in at wide receiver, a position of greater need than quarterback for Richmond Hill, according to Guy. Still, Fitzgerald’s athleticism shined through.“If you just throw up a 50/50 ball, Nick’s gonna come up with it,” Guy said. “All the sudden we had a legitimate passing attack with Nick out there.”Still, Fitzgerald’s size and arm talent gave Guy certainty that Fitzgerald’s spot at the next level would be at quarterback. When he brought Fitzgerald to the attention of Georgia offensive coordinator Mike Bobo and Georgia wide receivers coach Tony Ball, the Georgia assistants didn’t share the same vision.“Coach Ball was talking about making him a wide receiver or a tight end at the time,” Guy said.Of course, the Georgia recruiters misgivings were warranted to some degree. Fitzgerald did not become a full-time starter until his senior year, at which point it would have been too late for Georgia to extend an offer to him.Meanwhile, Guy watched as Georgia chose to give other quarterbacks he was familiar with roster spots while neglecting to look at Fitzgerald.“See, I coached Parker Welch and Grayson Lambert, also Georgia quarterbacks,” Guy said. “I coached those guys too, and I told [Georgia’s coaches], ‘Man this kid’s better, a lot better.’”
                       +2

Georgia was also not the only program to fail to see Fitzgerald’s potential, however. In the end, the only Power Five school to make him an offer was Mississippi State. Guy said he had always told his players “you need to go where you’re wanted,” and so Fitzgerald gave up a childhood dream of playing in Athens, and instead traveled out to Starkville.Last year, Fitzgerald’s first season as a starter, he passed for nearly 2,500 yards and a 21-to-10 touchdown to interception ratio to go along with 1,375 yards on the ground and an SEC-leading 16 rushing touchdowns. In just three games this season, Fitzgerald has already passed for seven touchdowns and ran for another five. The 12 touchdowns he’s accounted for by himself matches Georgia’s total team touchdown count through the same amount of games.It’s an offensive outburst which has been surprising to nearly everyone save Guy and Fitzgerald’s new coach, Dan Mullen.“I know coming out of high school, he wasn’t a very highly rated player, didn’t have all of the accolades that a lot of other recruited players had,” Mullen said on July 11 at SEC media days, “But I knew he had the skill set.”So how did Mullen see from two states over a flash of potential that Georgia’s recruiting staff couldn’t see directly in front of it?Part of it Guy attributes to Georgia’s perceived lack of recruiting interest in in-state, dual-threat quarterbacks. Recently, the team has failed to recruit Deshaun Watson out of Gainesville, Georgia, and Josh Dobbs out of Alpharetta, both of whom went on to have successful collegiate careers and become NFL draft picks.

“It’s like dual-threat is a bad word around some of these coaches,” Guy said. “I don’t know what their logic is. It is 2017. We’re no longer in the 70s. We can have a quarterback who runs.”Part of it was undoubtedly FItzgerald’s lack of national scouting attention and pedigree.“I think [Richt’s] assistants depended upon stars by the kids name before they actually got hot and heavy recruiting,” Guy said.But regardless of the reasoning, when Georgia meets Mississippi State on Saturday, it will be the visiting Bulldogs who hold the advantage at quarterback.And while Fitzgerald said he will enjoy playing in front of friends and family who wouldn’t normally be able to make the trip to Starkville to watch him play at home, he doesn’t have any extra, spite-driven motivation to perform for the school who never gave him much of a chance.“I don’t really have a chip on my shoulder or anything like that,” Fitzgerald said at a press conference in Starkville, Mississippi, on Sept. 18 “I know the reasons why people weren’t looking at me. I know it’s hard to take a chance on a guy that didn’t start at quarterback until his senior year.”And while Fitzgerald has since put his recruiting experiences behind him, Georgia fans will be left to wonder what might have happened if Georgia coaching staff had taken a shot on the inexperienced by athletic prospect out of Richmond Hill. On Sept. 23, they’ll get a taste of what exactly they missed out on, and how big a blunder failing to keep Fitzgerald in the state of Georgia may have been.“I’d say [Georgia] absolutely dropped the ball,” Guy said. “That’s what they did.”",Nathan Berg | Assistant Sports Editor,sports,https://www.redandblack.com/sports/football/nick-fitzgerald-the-one-who-got-away/article_c43972ec-9e66-11e7-a5db-e3eaf0b9d9d9.html

In Todd Gurley’s return after a four-game suspension for violating NCAA rules, Gurley returned a kickoff 100 yards to the end zone the first time he touched the ball. The score didn’t stand thanks to a penalty, but Gurley ultimately rushed for 138 yards in what was his final game as a Bulldog. Gurley tore his ACL later in the game, and then-freshman Nick Chubb stepped in to become Georgia’s leading rusher that day.

On the road, the Bulldogs shut out Missouri, even though Georgia was without star running back Todd Gurley. Gurley was beginning what would become a four-game suspension, and freshman Nick Chubb took the reins at that position.

Parrish was also in on another third down play on Mississippi State's second offensive drive. Parrish was back at practice this week, but head coach Kirby Smart said on Tuesday that Parrish was only practicing with “probably 30 to 40 percent of a normal workload” and he was “kind of on a pitch count.”

The Facebook page for the blackout has gathered almost 2,000 fans interested in a potential blackout.Cason credits Brigman with the idea.“We thought it’d be a great game to blackout, especially it being a night game and a big SEC matchup, both teams being ranked,” Brigman said. “Within a few days it [blew up].”As for any kind of bad luck associated with a UGA blackout, Brigman said he isn’t worried.“Three years ago, we played Auburn and had a fan-based blackout for that game … and that was another butt kickin’, it was another big win for Georgia,” Brickman said. “I think it’s a good look, I think it brings the energy to the stadium. The player’s love it, the recruits love it and we need to do everything we can to get [excited] for this game.”Brigman also said in an email with The Red & Black that the spike squad and paint line were both on board, and that this game, especially with it’s prime time slot on ESPN, would be perfect for a blackout.“This is a big game of the year, not what we expected at the start of the season,” Cason said. “Why not do something different?”",Harrison Young | Campus News Editor,uganews,https://www.redandblack.com/uganews/georgia-fans-vie-for-a-fan-led-black-out-on/article_787c290c-a001-11e7-8b5d-bb1fedc1e1e2.html

30-Sep-17,"Whitney talks touring, new music before first Athens show","For the first time since releasing its debut album in June 2016, the indie-rock act Whitney released new original music on Sept. 28. Whitney is also playing Athens for the first time Saturday, Sept. 30 at The Georgia Theatre.The newly released track “You and Me” is a demo that didn’t make it as a song onto the band’s album “Light Upon the Lake.” According to drummer and lead vocalist Julien Ehrlich, the song was almost immediately disregarded for the album during the recording process.“It only took us like an hour and a half to realize that it wasn’t going to make it on the record. Just, it just like doesn’t fit our style really. And we were proud of the song, but we weren’t


 


“It only took us like an hour and a half to realize that it wasn’t going to make it on the record. Just, it just like doesn’t fit our style really. And we were proud of the song, but we weren’tlike a hundred percent behind the song,” Ehrlich said.So they scrapped the song for the album and decided to write an instrumental piece instead which is how the song “Red Moon” ended up on the 2016 album “Light Upon the Lake.”“I don’t think we ever want to put synths in a Whitney song again,” Ehrlich said of “You and Me.”Still, the duo, the other member of which is guitarist Max Kakacek, wanted to release the “You and Me” demo because they had only released ten original songs prior.“I guess [to] give people a little bit more,” Ehrlich said, explaining their decision to release the song.However, the band did release several covers in 2017. Whitney’s covers of “You’ve Got a Woman” by Lion and “Gonna Hurry (As Slow as I Can)” by Dolly Parton were released in March, and a cover of Bob Dylan’s “Tonight I'll Be Staying Here with You” was released in February of this year.The release of “You and Me” is not a singular event as the demos for “Light Upon the Lake” will be out on Nov. 10 with the “You and Me” demo and a cover of “Southern Nights” by Allen Toussaint.


 


With the demo release acting as a marker for the end of the “Light Upon the Lake” era, Whitney has started working on its next album. According to Ehrlich, they have about three songs pretty much done although they’re still toiling with some lyrics.“We just want to be in our apartment writing at the moment,” Ehrlich said.All of Whitney’s discography thus far has been recorded on tape, and Ehrlich said they plan to continue working in this format.“It’s not just to, like, be a stickler or something. I don’t know, we don’t do it just because we think it’s cool, it’s like we do it because it actually does sound amazing,” Ehrlich said of using tape.Whitney has a particular affinity for older music formats. Besides recording on tape, all the music the band has released is available on vinyl – even the Spotify singles – and the demos will also be available on vinyl when that album is released in full.“There’s like obviously a vinyl resurgence happening, which we love. I mean like people – it kind of makes sense too because like everything is just so incredibly digital and you’re just staring into a screen at all times. So, it kind of makes sense that the most analog, besides tape, like the most organic and like real method of listening to music, would come back in this way,” Ehrlich said.Having done extensive touring with “Light Upon the Lake,” Ehrlich said his favorite song to play live still varies show to show. However, he said “Golden Days” is always solid.“It’s not easy to play by any means on my behalf, but I don’t know, I feel like we kind of – I always prep myself to focus a hundred percent on that song cause I know that it’s challenging, so I pretty much always show up for it and feel really good about it,” Ehrlich said.

Touring with “Light Upon the Lake” in the past year included opening for Phoenix and playing large-scale festivals like Lollapalooza in Chicago, the duo's hometown, and Summer Sonic in Tokyo, Japan.“I think we all love it actually, those shows are really fun,” Ehrlich said of playing festivals.Whitney, which formed in 2015, will also be touring South America for the first time in November.“I want to go [there for] the first record, so we can start to like build like a real fan base there,” Ehrlich said.Ehrlich said he’s really excited to travel to such a cool, foreign place with the benefit of little to no jet lag.Ehrlich is also excited to return to Athens which was one of the first places he played with his old band Unknown Mortal Orchestra. However, this upcoming show will be the first time Whitney plays in Athens.“I just love Athens actually,” Ehrlich said.The band will be playing at the Georgia Theatre on Saturday, Sept. 30. Doors are at 8:00 p.m. and the show starts at 9:00.

1-Oct-17,A data-driven future: Informatics finds place in different academic fields,"As founding co-president of #DataDawgs, an informatics student club focused on data analysis, Maanasa Ghantasala, a sophomore computer systems engineering major from Alpharetta, thinks that informatics will play an important role in all industries.“Every firm or every organization has some amount of data about its consumers,” Ghantasala said. “When we analyze this data, it can give us a lot of information about things we haven't even thought of before.”UGA defines informatics as “a broad field that encompasses the collection, classification, storage, retrieval, analysis and dissemination of massive data sets.”


 


According to the UGA press release, informatics could be useful in genome studies for medicine and agriculture, political polling information from Internet data and financial market and other economic analyses. “These applications will prove to be pretty useful across a lot of different fields,” Ghantasala said.To cater to the interests of Ghantasala and other students like her, and to bring the growing field of informatics to UGA, Georgia Informatics Institute for Research and Education began in the fall of 2016.According to Kyle Johnsen, the director of GII which is housed within the College of Engineering, the need for the GII was determined by the informatics planning committee.“The committee recommended its formation based on meetings with advisory boards, which include alumni, students and faculty, as well as surveys distributed to department heads and deans across campus,” Johnsen said.According to the Johnsen, GII is a network of three institutes: the Institute of Bioinformatics, the Health Informatics Institute, and the Institute for Cyber-Security and Privacy. Each of the institutes reports to their respective colleges but are linked through joint faculty partnerships.“The value of being an institue, relative to a center, is that in addition to having a research focus, we can create and govern academic programs such as courses, certificates, minors and majors,” Johnsen said.


 


The GII offers an undergraduate Certificate in Informatics which includes one foundational informatics course and four discipline-specific informatics courses.According to UGA’s GII website, “the purpose of GII is to help faculty use informatics as a tool to help answer research questions while making it easier for them to incorporate informatics into their instruction.”Despite GII’s young age, informatics is not a new area of concentration for the university.In 2015, a Presidential Informatics Hiring Initiative brought eight new informatics faculty members to campus. They work within seven departments and five of the university’s schools and colleges. Overall, UGA has more than 160 faculty members who apply informatics to a diverse set of fields.Mariam Hammadui, a senior Computer Systems Engineering from Watkinsville and #DataDawg co-president, said student interest in informatics is high after tabling for #DataDawg.“It’s really interesting because you would think only engineering or computer science majors are interested in informatics, but we have a lot of business students, and students from all over campus,” Hammadui said. “Informatics is something you can relate to pretty much any field.”Johnsen agrees that nearly every field is engaged in informatics at some level and has been for some time.“The difference nowadays is the level of informatics literacy and skill required to realize the benefits of massive digitization,” he said. “For most UGA departments and colleges, there are currently at least a few faculty who have such expertise and are already a part of the GII. As clusters emerge, new centers and institutes will form and the GII network will grow. “


TNCMS.AdManager.render({region: 'fixed-big-ad-bottom-asset', slot: 1, fold: ""below""});


However, Johnsen’s vision for the GII extends beyond additional academic offerings, centers and institutes.“I envision the GII becoming a more externally facing entity at UGA,” Johnsen said. “There are few topics so cross-cutting as informatics to our industry and government stakeholders. We can deliver value to them in several ways, including workforce and professional development, infrastructure, and, of course, basic science and applied research.”As far as what GII can add to a student’s education, Hammadui knows that studying informatics and computer systems will help her make a meaningful impact after graduation.“It’s important to me because learning in this field gives me a lot of power no matter what field I end up working in,” Hammadui said. “You would think you have to be a doctor to help people, but you can still help people with computer science or computer engineering through informatics.”",Karlee Kuc | Contributor,uganews,https://www.redandblack.com/uganews/a-data-driven-future-informatics-finds-place-in-different-academic/article_17cf6346-a3c4-11e7-a1df-ef06cd3d30ec.html
7-Oct-17,New EP by Frank Iero and the Patience features raw reworkings of old songs,"“Keep The Coffins Coming” is the newest release by Frank Iero and the Patience. The four-song EP follows two albums released by the band: “Stomachaches,” which was originally released under the band name frnkiero andthe cellabration, and “Parachutes.”The EP opens with “I’m a Mess” which was released previously on the band’s most recent album “Parachutes.” The song appears in an updated form on “Keep The Coffins Coming.” The most noticeable change is in the vocals. On “Parachutes,” the vocals are smooth and loud. The EP version places the vocals further back in the track and is less crisp – Iero’s voice also tends to slide more.


 


The backing vocals also take greater prominence in the new version, while they tightly follow Iero’s vocals on the “Parachutes” version, they trail behind Iero’s vocals on the EP version. About halfway through the song appears a heavy bass section.On “Parachutes,” the bass is more muted than on “Keep The Coffins Coming.” On the latter, the vibration of the strings can be heard, and the drums also take a leading role. The greater emphasis on the kick drum gives the song a heavier sound“B.F.F” jumps off the fading out distortion of “I’m a Mess” with a clear drum section. Iero’s vocals follow with a whiny quality. Following the story of a friendship that broke apart rather than a current “best friends” relationship, the vocals give the lyrics a more mournful, but also childish quality. “I wish that we never fell out. I wish that we never fight again,” Iero sings. The irony in the lyrics is that if they did fall out they won’t fight again because they’re already apart. The verb tense shift is then also interesting. The song was uploaded with an official music video on YouTube in 2014. It featured Iero’s daughters Lily and Cherry who also lent their voices to that version. The new version of the song, however, still expresses the childhood perception of friendship paired with a more adult sentiment of loss without the children’s voices prominently featured.

The third track on the EP is “No Fun Club.” This song is only minute and a half long and runs at breakneck speed. Iero’s vocals are scratchy and have a clear punk basis because they lean more towards speech and yelling than singing. At times, particularly in the chorus, the words become almost indecipherable. The shouts garble the enunciation which adds to the brutality of the song’s sound. “I don't want your fun. I'm not having fun,” Iero sings. The existence of a “No Fun Club” has been a recurring reference for Iero, and this song encapsulates what being part of that “club” means. The song is a redone version of “xmas sux” which was released in 2012. The EP version features entirely new lyrics, but the identifiable guitar riff at the opening immediately links it to the previous song.The final track on the EP is a cover of the famous song “You Are My Sunshine.” The history of the song’s origins is uncertain, but theories suggest that Paul Rice wrote the song in the late 30s and the Pine Ridge Boys had the first release in 1939; the song was later sold to Jimmie Davis who released the song in 1940. Regardless of its creation myth, the song has remained relevant throughout the decades due to the multitude of subsequent covers including a version released by Johnny Cash. Frank Iero and the Patience revitalizes the song by turning away from its original country sound to a darker rock sound. The heavy distortion on the electric guitar immediately separates the track from its early predecessors. Iero’s desperate and imploring vocal performance keeps the focus on loss rather than diverting it with a happier sound. Lines like “But now you've left me and love another. You have shattered all of my dreams,” are particularly emotive.“Keep The Coffins Coming” features the raw, gut-driven sound characteristic of Frank Iero and the Patience. The four-song EP includes reworkings of past songs and a cover. As a collection, the EP gives a look into the evolution of the band’s sound, allowing listeners to compare new and old songs and the band’s stylization of other artists’ songs.",By Anna Haas | Staff Writer,culture,https://www.redandblack.com/culture/new-ep-by-frank-iero-and-the-patience-features-raw/article_bd354324-ab61-11e7-8194-4f4b0ba4a71c.html

The police report said one could see through the blinds and curtains.That night, police were able to arrest the suspect and obtain his camera.On Oct. 6, while looking through the suspect’s camera, police also discovered images and videos taken at the Sigma Kappa sorority house.All images and videos were taken at night through windows and “cracks of blinds,” according to a second police report.Police notified members of the Sigma Kappa sorority house.Following this arrest, Mcelroy has been tied to four additional Peeping Tom cases, 16 burglary cases and five larceny-thefts, according to a press release sent out by Epifanio Rodriguez, public information officer at Athens-Clarke County Police Department.According to the press release, many of these cases date back to 2013. More recently, detectives suspect Mcelroy has been committing crimes while working as an Uber driver.Police are asking any victims of Mcelroy to contact ACCPD.

13-Oct-17,"Georgia soccer's late-game, defensive breakdowns responsible for 0-6 start in SEC play","After six games in the Southeastern Conference, the Georgia women’s soccer team is still winless in SEC play.In four of those defeats, the Bulldogs have been tied going into the 80th minute.However, as soon as the last ten minutes of the game come along, the Bulldogs find a way to lose. Some of the goals Georgia has conceded have been from set pieces or getting caught on a counter attack from the other team.


 


Head coach Billy Lesesne says fatigue has played its part in the late goals.“I think some if it has to do with physical and mental fatigue, so rotating players and getting some fresher legs is important to us,” Lesesne said. “When you get physically tired, sometimes that [inner] voice isn’t always positive.”Lesesne is also preaching the importance of taking calculated risks. Lesesne wants his team to know when to go forward and try to get the winning goal, or when to sit back and protect the draw.“I think our team kind of feels a little bit in desperation mode trying to get points,” Lesesne said. “Sometimes taking risks offensively can be counter productive, and I think that’s something we’ve recognized and pointed out to the team.”With all the late minute defeats, Lesesne has addressed that he wants all his players cheering each other on.“We talked about players that are on the bench to continue to support your teammates,” Lesesne said. “The players that are surrounding the field are making sure that we're staying focus, encouraging and pushing each other through.”Part of the reason the Bulldogs are working on keeping a positive mindset is their tendency to let in the first goal.Senior Summer Burnett, who has started every game for the Bulldogs, knows how the first goal can change the momentum of the match.


 


“You just have to be mentally turned on,” Burnett said. “You can’t rely on the first five minutes of the game to get into the game. You have to be ready from the whistle.”Lesesne knows that the first goal can dictate how the rest of the match is going to play, so being better defensively is important to him.However, with all the losses, Lesesne is optimistic that his team will bounce back from the defeats.“It is demoralizing when you lose late,” Lesesne said. “This team hasn’t given up and still will fight until the last minute.”",Yash Bhika | Contributor,sports,https://www.redandblack.com/sports/soccer/georgia-soccer-s-late-game-defensive-breakdowns-responsible-for-/article_5c735bd0-b056-11e7-bbb1-07c77e302c6a.html
15-Oct-17,UGA study says biomass energy not feasible in U.S.,"Wood pellets used for biomass energy, an alternative to fossil fuels, are produced right outside of Athens, but do not expect to see biomass energy adopted here. Those pellets are shipped straight to Europe, and new University of Georgia research shows why.“With global warming, we really want to reduce carbon emissions,” said Dr. Richard Bin Mei, co-author of a study on biomass-produced electricity. “In the United States, unfortunately, we do not have the mandate or government subsidies, so our study looked at whether it is economically feasible to co-fire wood pellets with coal to produce power, and the answer is no, unless the government does the same thing as the EU.”Bin Mei , a professor in the UGA Warnell School of Forestry and Natural Resources, and researchers from Purdue University, examined the economics of transitioning to biomass use in a recent study published in the journal Energy Economics.


 


They determined that it is economically prohibitive to convert coal firing plants to biomass in the United States without government subsidies.According to Bin Mei, Europe has widely adopted biomass energy as a replacement for coal in energy plants in order to cut harmful fossil fuel emissions. European nations receive nearly five million tons of wood pellets each year from the U.S. for their energy plants, but the U.S. itself has not adopted the cleaner method because of the cost. Under the U.S.’s Clean Power Plan, in the next 25 years, power plants are expected to lower their carbon emissions by 32 percent from 2005 levels.While burning wood for energy can have negative consequences for deforestation and air pollution, biomass is generally considered to be less harmful than burning coal or other fossil fuels. Growing trees for the pellets offsets emissions from burning wood, and if fast growing tree species are selected, deforestation can be avoided.According to Bin Mei, it would be unrealistic for U.S. companies to totally abandon their coal firing plants, so the study examined the cost for coal firing plants to switch to a co-firing setup where biomass is burned alongside the coal. However, according to Bin Mei, the costs to convert plants to a co-firing method would either require the government to subsidize the conversion or customers would have to pay a cost.Effectively, plants will remain only coal burning due to no incentive to convert. Bin Mei said the required subsidies would cost the government roughly the same amount as it currently spends on subsidies for other alternative forms of energy like solar and wind.“All else equal, the government could consider wooden biomass as an alternative fuel to feed traditional coal based power plants,” Bin Mei said. “By design, a coal power plant is designed for 30 to 50 years. It is not economically feasible just to abandon the coal plant, but if you convert it to co-firing, you just add a small percentage of pellets to the furnace. It is not that hard, you just pay a conversion cost and achieve a certain reduction in carbon emission production.”",Olivia Adams | Staff Writer,uganews,https://www.redandblack.com/uganews/uga-study-says-biomass-energy-not-feasible-in-u-s/article_f7a47744-b1ad-11e7-a22f-c3832c7998e7.html
15-Oct-17,Football game or track meet? Multiple UGA players hurdle defenders against Missouri,"In Georgia’s win over Missouri, not just one but three different players jumped over defenders as they plowed down the field, likening their moves to the ones once made by players such as Todd Gurley and Knowshon Moreno.First came Nick Chubb. Georgia’s star tailback leapt over a defender early in the second quarter en route to a 20-yard gain. About four minutes of game clock later, tight end Charlie Woerner had his turn hurdling the opponent. Woerner ran for 50 yards on that play, equaling the number of receiving yards he accumulated in all of last year.

Just before the third quarter ended, freshman running back D’Andre Swift became the third Georgia player to make the jump when he took off for a long run that was ultimately called back due to an illegal motion penalty.“You know those guys, it's instinct for them,” head coach Kirby Smart said. “I think when teams cut tackle way down at your feet, sometimes that can happen more often. But we did a good job. I'm more worried about securing the ball.”For wide receiver Mecole Hardman, he said the hurdles show how these playmakers have “good vision.” But Hardman was surprised by Chubb’s standout play thanks to Chubb’s identity as a downhill runner.“Chubb really doesn't get off the ground like that,” Hardman said. “He's looking to run you over and that type of stuff. When he jumped up there, that's something that showed he really could do something else.”These plays helped pick up a few more yards in what was a huge day for Georgia’s offense. The Bulldogs tallied 696 yards, 370 of those coming on the ground and 326 sailing through the air.But these three individual plays caused an extra dose of excitement. On the sideline, kicker Rodrigo Blankenship said “everyone's jaw just drops and their hands go up.”“It speaks to just the fact that no matter who has the ball in their hands, they want to get every little bit out of it they can,” Blankenship said.",Emily Giambalvo | Senior Staff Writer,gameday,https://www.redandblack.com/gameday/football-game-or-track-meet-multiple-uga-players-hurdle-defenders/article_bed4e044-b161-11e7-acbd-8b1dee5da23f.html
15-Oct-17,Georgia receiver Mecole Hardman has breakout night against Missouri,"This time last year, Mecole Hardman was a defensive back. He had never played as a receiver until this year. His 2017 season, up until Saturday, had been speckled with dropped balls that landed in his hands.But against Missouri, just about everything was clicking for Hardman.“It's been there,” Hardman said. “I've just got to take advantage of opportunities that I get and I did that today.”


 


The receiver accounted for one rushing touchdown and one receiving touchdown against the Tigers, and the touchdown reception came on a 59-yard pass from Jake Fromm.Hardman finished the day with just one carry and two receptions. But each time he touched the ball on offense, Hardman picked up at least a first down. His touchdown on the ground was the product of a 35-yard carry, and his only non-scoring offensive touch was a 12-yard reception.“Mecole is electrifying,” defensive back J.R. Reed said. “I'm glad he's on our side.”Before Saturday, Hardman never had a game where he tallied more than 27 receiving yards. In fact, in Georgia’s first six games, Hardman accumulated 58 yards total, meaning his touchdown catch in the fourth quarter single handedly doubled his season receiving yards.Hardman said he’s still transitioning into his new role, but he doesn’t doubt his ability when it comes to making plays on offense.“I feel like if I get in space, I don't feel like I can be caught,” Hardman said. “That's how you're supposed to think as a runner. I was confident in my speed and when I get in open field, I think I can do what most people can do in open field and not get caught.”That’s exactly what Hardman did on his 35-yard carry that resulted in a touchdown.In Saturday’s game, Hardman showed off all the ways he can make plays. He can run the ball, and he can catch the ball. Plus, he’s been a key player on kickoff returns, especially against Missouri. He averaged 22 yards in his three returns.


 


And despite being a newcomer on this side of the ball, Hardman proved on Saturday that he can contribute on offense.“You guys got to see him with some speed, some burst, some get open and really run,” head coach Kirby Smart said. “Mecole is a very attentive player that is passionate about the game. I love the way he approaches each practice and the way he works. I hope that gives him a little confidence so he continues to grow.”",Emily Giambalvo | Senior Staff Writer,gameday,https://www.redandblack.com/gameday/georgia-receiver-mecole-hardman-has-breakout-night-against-missouri/article_2cba89f6-b16c-11e7-b9da-3770603d7fee.html
18-Oct-17,Bye week offers chance for rest and improvement for Georgia defense,"Every college football team across the nation typically gets one weekend during the regular season to take a break from playing a game.A bye week can mean something different for every team, but for Georgia’s defense, it means a chance to heal and regroup after a rash of injuries and a season-worst performance.In Saturday’s 53-28 win over Missouri, the Georgia defense surrendered over 300 yards of offense and four touchdowns to the Tigers. During that game, the Bulldogs were also missing four defensive players due to injury.


 


Two of those players, defensive lineman Trenton Thompson and linebacker Reggie Carter, are once again practicing, and they will have plenty of opportunity to get reps during Georgia’s off week.The other two Bulldogs, David Marshall and Daquan Hawkins-Muckle, have not returned yet and there is no indication as to when they might be back.After his team’s victory over Missouri, head coach Kirby Smart said the bye week would offer a chance for players to both recover from the wear the first seven games of the schedule inflicted and improve their style of play.At a press conference on Tuesday, Smart provided more of a look into how that would play out.“I look at the recovery part as Sunday and Monday, which they had two days off,"" Smart said. ""I look at Friday, Saturday, Sunday as three days off. That’s five days off in an eight-day window. We’re going to go to work Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday.”On Tuesday, Smart expressed concern over Georgia’s efforts in the pass rush. Against Missouri, the Bulldog front seven recorded no sacks, no quarterback hurries and two pass deflections as Missouri quarterback Drew Lock threw for 253 yards and four touchdowns.“We’re not disrupting the quarterback enough,” Smart said. “We’re trying to really work hard at it this week to generate some, and it’s not more pressure, it’s not more blitzes, it’s just rush guys and win.”Senior linebacker Davin Bellamy echoed his coach’s statements, saying the pass rush needs to improve while pointing to speed as a factor in potential improvement.


 


If Thompson is able to emerge from the bye week healthy, something Smart said he expects, the Bulldogs will have regained a valuable force in the pass rush. The junior had five sacks last season, although Thompson had recorded none in 2017 before his injury.Whether or not Thompson’s return will facilitate an improved Georgia pass rush remains to be seen. But the Bulldog defense will look to make the most out of the off week before it departs on the second half of its schedule, starting with a matchup with Florida on Oct. 28.“We weren’t rushing like we were the first couple of games,” Bellamy said. “I don’t know why that is, but we have the bye week to figure it out.”",Alex Soderstrom | Senior Staff Writer,sports,https://www.redandblack.com/sports/bye-week-offers-chance-for-rest-and-improvement-for-georgia/article_edff7006-b408-11e7-a129-77fd35001f86.html
19-Oct-17,Shutting down the club: Davin Bellamy says goodbye to protective hand wrapping,"For the first time in weeks, when Georgia linebacker Davin Bellamy practices, his fingers are actually visible.Since Sept. 30, Bellamy has played with a club, a ball of protective wrapping with a hard exterior, on his left hand after injuring it. Bellamy broke a bone in his hand during the Tennessee game and has practiced and played with the club, which completely covers his hand, to prevent further injury.But now, the club is off for Bellamy.


 


On Tuesday, the senior was spotted wearing a much smaller wrapping that allows him to use his fingers in practice. When asked if he placed the club on his mantle at home, Bellamy was adamant he had not.“Oh no,” Bellamy said. “I want to get that as far away as possible.”While Bellamy said he never complained about wearing the club before, mainly because he said he didn’t want to “make excuses,” the outside linebacker said the protective measure did hinder his play.“It’s already hard enough playing D-Line in this league, and especially with my hand, it can get pretty tough,” Bellamy said.Specifically, Bellamy said the club interfered with his ability to gain leverage when defending the run, since he could not use his left hand to grab at blockers.Similarly, the club prevented Bellamy from using his hand effectively in the pass rush, specifically when rushing from the right side and trying to use his left hand to get outside of blockers.“I wasn’t able to stab or I wasn’t able to counter move or I couldn’t grab, so it kind of forced me to be on one side of the field on pass rushing,” Bellamy said.The club did come in handy for deflecting passes, Bellamy said, such as the pass he knocked down on Oct. 14 against Missouri.“I think I would have deflected it anyway, but with the circumference of the big ol’ club, I didn’t even feel it,” Bellamy said.Bellamy won’t have the chance to showcase his newly-freed hand on Saturday, as the Bulldogs will be off on a bye week. But once Georgia does take the field again, Bellamy will be back to his old, club-less self.“It’s back to regularly-scheduled programming,” Bellamy said.",Alex Soderstrom | Senior Staff Writer,sports,https://www.redandblack.com/sports/football/shutting-down-the-club-davin-bellamy-says-goodbye-to-protective/article_fe5a0c1e-b4cf-11e7-8cca-ab1e90172c2a.html
19-Oct-17,Running Back U: How Georgia has sustained success at one position through the years,"Nick Chubb had nowhere to go. After taking the handoff, Chubb initially tried to follow his blockers up the middle. But there was no crease, so he bounced to the outside, easily picking up the few yards he needed for a first down. And then he kept going.Ten yards downfield, Chubb encountered a Missouri defender. Channeling the spirits of Todd Gurley and Knowshon Moreno, Chubb took flight, hurdling the safety, landing in stride and prompting a roar from the Sanford Stadium crowd.Three plays later, fellow senior Sony Michel took a carry of his own. Untouched, he raced 36 yards to the end zone. Touchdown, Georgia.


 


This is what Chubb and Michel have done for the last four years. They’re both in the top 10 on Georgia’s all-time list for most rushing yards.This is what they have been doing this season. They’re climbing up the record books, chasing the celebrated backs of Georgia’s past. They’re scoring touchdowns — 14 times between the two this year. And they’re winning games.But this is also what will come to an end in three months.“It was our time while I was playing,” said Keith Marshall, who was on Georgia’s team from 2012 until 2015. “Now, it's their time. And after they leave, it'll be some other players that will come and do great things. That's just what happens. It's a revolving door, especially at that position.”By the middle of January, however Georgia’s season may end, Chubb and Michel’s identifiers as Georgia running backs will permanently be preceded by the word “former.” Their statistics will freeze, waiting to be surpassed by players in younger generations. And if they play in the NFL, their success will materialize with plaques on a glass wall inside Georgia’s athletic facility. Those are held in a room that sits adjacent to the one that contains Georgia’s two Heisman Trophies, each earned by a running back.Surely next year on Sundays, eyes in Athens will turn toward the teams for which Chubb and Michel play. But the notable question that will consume fans as they examine Georgia’s running back position through the spring and into the fall will be a simple one: Who’s next?When a generation watchesGeorgia football was not on the radar of Tim Worley when he was a kid. Growing up in Lumberton, North Carolina, Worley was a fan of UNC and Clemson. But thanks to Herschel Walker, Worley started to notice the Bulldogs, because after all, Worley said, everyone across the country had begun paying attention to Walker.“When I saw him running the ball for Georgia, I said, 'That's what I want to do right there,’” Worley said.And that’s exactly what he did from 1985 to 1988. Despite missing nearly two seasons because of a knee injury and some academic troubles, Worley finished his career with more than 2,000 rushing yards.In Houston, another child, who eventually became one of Worley’s teammates, watched Georgia for the first time when the Bulldogs won the national title in 1980. Rodney Hampton usually focused his attention on the teams from Texas and Oklahoma, but being in a family that loved sports, of course they had the TV on for the title game.

As a freshman, Herschel Walker led the Georgia team to a win over Notre Dame in the national championship game. Walker rushed for more than 1,600 yards in his first season.

A few years later, when Hampton was going through the recruiting process, Georgia sent him a few letters. Hampton said he “flashed back to 1980,” remembering how Walker ran the ball, proving that Georgia was a program where freshmen could contribute. In Hampton’s first year as a Bulldog in 1987, he rushed for 890 yards, averaging 7.1 yards per carry.In later generations, it’s the same story, just with different names — at least for the players who grew up with ties to Georgia. Marshall, who has family in Atlanta but was raised in North Carolina, watched Georgia face Hawaii in the 2008 Sugar Bowl. That was the first time Marshall saw Moreno play.“He just went crazy,” Marshall said of Moreno’s two-touchdown performance. “After that, I was a big fan.” But these are more than just feel-good tales of young boys watching impressive players. It turns into a recruiting tool, something former Bulldog running back Thomas Brown said he used to his advantage when he coached his old position at Georgia in 2015. (And he still does, just now he’s the offensive coordinator at Miami, where there’s also a tradition of strong tailbacks.) He said it helps to be able to give recruits “real-life examples” of players who had successful college careers and went on to play professionally. When Willie McClendon coached running backs at Georgia from 1989 to 1993, he told recruits if they became Bulldogs they had a high chance of accomplishing three feats: get drafted to play in the NFL, become a Heisman Trophy candidate and be in a position to earn a college degree.“[Recruits] see how Georgia is going to run the ball regardless, and running backs keep coming out of here,” said Musa Smith, who played at Georgia from 2000 until 2002. “It's very hard for a high school recruit, especially if you're playing the running back position, not to look at that and say, 'Hey, that's something I want to be part of, the great legacy.’”

The Herschel effectThe conversation usually starts with Walker.When Gurley was a junior in high school, Georgia reached out to his coach, Jeff Craddock. Gurley said he wasn’t sure why. He wasn’t going to go to Georgia, and he hadn’t ever paid attention to the Bulldogs. Gurley only somewhat followed college football. He kind of liked LSU, but he was more interested in the NFL and Duke basketball.Then, Bryan McClendon, Willie’s son who coached running backs at Georgia after his career as a receiver, came to North Carolina to visit Tarboro High School.

“So what do you know about Georgia?” Gurley remembers McClendon asking. “I know you know Herschel Walker.” ""Who?"" Gurley said. Craddock and McClendon both looked at Gurley, shocked. Even Craddock, an Ohio State fan, had grown up watching Walker. Meanwhile, McClendon was raised in a household with a former Georgia running back as his dad. ""What are you looking at me for?"" Gurley said.The two coaches in the room explained. And with that, Gurley’s education in UGA Running Backs 101 officially began.

Before playing in the NFL, Todd Gurley racked up 3,285 rushing yards, placing him third on Georgia's all-time list.

Other well-known backs came before Walker, including 1942 Heisman winner Frank Sinkwich and NFL Hall of Famer Charley Trippi, both of whom were on the 1942 national championship team. But Walker is the one who sits atop the all-time list for most rushing yards in the SEC, and he’s a player who “you can talk about for generations and generations,” Brown said.

Walker’s three-year Georgia career, which generated 5,259 yards — a total that doesn’t include bowl games — opened the floodgates for a steady stream of highly rated backs heading to Athens. “When Herschel came along, that's when everything kind of exploded, where we really perfected the tailback, the I-formation position where you've got a guy 6-2, 220, 225 pounds that's running like a track star and he's carrying the ball 45 times a game,” Worley said. “As a tailback, who wouldn't love that?”Like Prince, Madonna or Bono, Herschel needs no last name. To Georgia fans, Walker is as big of a celebrity as there is. And anytime a new running back starts to show signs of potential, Walker’s name slips into conversations because, Smith said, “everybody loves to compare you to Herschel if you're doing good.”Walker has become the crux around which Georgia’s tradition of running backs has flourished, and when there’s debate as to which schools are historically the best at this position, Walker certainly doesn’t hurt Georgia’s case.“Obviously, we've got Herschel,” Gurley said. “That helps out a lot just being able to say, 'Well, we've got one of the best college players of all time, so we're just going to stop there.'"" So the conversation ends with Walker, too.Measuring greatnessCertain plays combine to create a collection of Georgia running back lore, ranging from Walker’s touchdown against Tennessee that prompted Larry Munson’s “My God, a freshman!"" call to Gurley’s post-suspension kickoff return against Auburn when fans hardly cared the touchdown was ultimately called back.

But there are also more tangible units of measurement. Georgia has had five players in its history rush for more than 3,000 yards in their career. Just two other SEC schools — Alabama and Arkansas — have had more players accomplish that. In a few games, Michel will likely bump Georgia up to six players at that mark, leaving the Bulldogs just behind Alabama, which has seven.Georgia’s running backs have recently surged up the school’s leader board. Five of the top 10 rushers started their careers in 2004 or later. On top of that, many of Georgia’s top backs have gone on to play professionally. In the last 30 years, nine Georgia running backs have been selected in the first three rounds of the NFL draft “When you have a group of guys year after year after year at that position getting drafted in the first or second round, to me, that's Tailback U,” said Worley, the seventh overall pick in 1989.

Gurley, who plays for the Los Angeles Rams, has the fourth-most rushing yards in the NFL this season.Plenty of other schools have produced top-tier running backs. Some of Georgia’s former players mentioned Southern California, Alabama, Ohio State, Miami and LSU as programs that can tout their identity as an RBU. As for which one rises above the rest, that just depends on who you’re talking to. 

“Everybody is always going to say their school,” Gurley said. “USC is going to say their school. Wisconsin might say it's going to be them. It's all what you think. But at the end of the day, I think it's Georgia.”Next in lineSo far this year, the Bulldogs’ on-the-ground production has been more than just the Chubb and Michel show. The two seniors have led the way, but the younger backs aren’t far behind. Freshman D’Andre Swift has 358 rushing yards at the halfway point of the season, and sophomores Elijah Holyfield and Brian Herrien each have more than 25 carries. Thanks to Georgia’s undefeated start that has featured a few lopsided games, there have been plenty of chances for the young backs to offer glimpses into how this position will change, yet also remain the same.“To see those guys get the ball, you know in years from now, they'll still be here, still making big plays,” Chubb said the week of Georgia’s game against Samford, a matchup in which Swift, Herrien and Holyfield combined for 26 carries and 127 yards.

Even as he plays behind Nick Chubb and Sony Michel, freshman D'Andre Swift is in the top 20 for most rushing yards in the SEC this year.

Now 15 years since he played for Georgia, Smith was in Athens for the Samford game, where he was selected to “Call the Dawgs” prior to kickoff. Smith left Sanford Stadium with pride for how his position has sustained its dominance, and he said Georgia’s backups could be starters if they were on teams with less running back depth.So how does Georgia continue to recruit top running backs when there’s already an abundance of talent in Athens? 

Kirby Smart said he turns on the film. He asks recruits whether they want to be a running back at Georgia, where they’ll get to carry the ball plenty of times, or if they'd rather be blocking for a pass-heavy team. The recruits say they want to run the ball. And Georgia is a place where they know they’ll get to do that.“I don't know how many times we carry,” Smart said the week after the Vanderbilt game. “Thirty?”The reporters in the room said it was more like 50 carries against the Commodores.“Fifty?” Smart said. “Good gosh, that's a lot of carries.” And the Vanderbilt game wasn’t an outlier. Georgia is averaging around that many per game this season. With that type of offense and half the season still in front of the Bulldogs, Chubb is on pace to slide into the No. 2 spot for most career rushing yards in the SEC. He would stand only behind Walker.

Then Chubb will move on. So will Michel. Swift and company will take over. The records will continue to be chased, and perhaps at some point, a player will surpass Chubb’s mark. Or maybe even Walker’s. Chubb has at least proven it’s possible to get close. “That's what Georgia fans are looking forward to, is that next guy, next running back,” Gurley said. “Every year it's like, 'We need him to be the Herschel that's going to take us to the national championship.' It's definitely a lot of pressure, but that's just that standard.” Three years ago in Laurinburg, North Carolina, a town 230 miles northeast of Athens, Richard Bailey noticed a kid during Scotland High School’s summer workouts who, on top of his speed, was fairly big for his age.Bailey, the school’s head coach, let the ninth grader play on varsity, anticipating he’d be a backup. His first touch in a game was a long touchdown run, Bailey said. Since then, the high schooler has only gotten taller, bigger, faster and stronger.“He has to continue to learn the game of football and all the little nuances,” Bailey said. “But as far as his skill set, there's nothing he can't do on the football field.” His name is Zamir White. He’s the nation’s top running back in the Class of 2018.

20-Oct-17,Moving ahead: Bryan Kamau leads UGA cross country in preparation for SEC Championships,"Following Georgia cross country’s solid outing at this past weekend’s NCAA Pre-Nationals meet, the realization for seniors came that the regular season — their last regular season — was over.One may assume senior Bryan Kamau, a 2016 NCAA All-Region runner, was setting time aside to reflect on his tenure with UGA cross country. As next week’s SEC Championships approach, Kamau certainly sets time aside to remember his career with the team. However, he will do so while prioritizing his team’s preparation for the meet in Athens the only way he knows how: Leading by example.Kamau, a Snellville native, was one of six seniors to lead the men’s team to a 17th place finish at NCAA Pre-Nationals this past Friday. The meet marked the end of final regular season for Kamau, whose tenure with UGA cross country has spanned four full years.


 


“Bryan was a part of a group that got to run more meets his freshman year, which is somewhat atypical in men’s cross country. Since then, he’s gotten valuable experience his sophomore and junior years, and now I think he really is ready to be a leader for us,” head coach Patrick Cunniff said.Throughout these years with the team, Kamau has been able to develop genuine bonds with his teammates, and expressed gratitude for the fact that he can be considered a leader for his squad.“Most of what we do is together. … It has just been a great bond these past four years,” Kamau said. “I just try to be there for them, whatever they’re going through.”“Most of what we do is together. … It has just been a great bond these past four years. I just try to be there for them, whatever they’re going through.”-Bryan Kamau, senior Cross Country runner Kamau aims to stay involved with what his teammates are dealing with, both in and out of the sport. Cunniff believes this fact only does more to speak to his qualities as a leader, noting how he can use Kamau’s close relationships with teammates in order to better communicate with the team as a whole.


 


“Bryan is truly appreciative and empathetic. He is someone who looks out for others as much as himself, and in turn, I think that makes our whole team better,” Cunniff said.With UGA set to host the SEC Championships on Friday, Oct. 27th, the Bulldogs have some time to rest and prepare for the biggest meet of the season so far. In this time, Kamau stressed how each member of the team will focus on what their role is so that come next week, the execution of all of their hard work will be second-nature.“The goal remains the same as it was at the beginning of the season,” Kamau said. “That is to work as hard as we possibly can and execute on the given day to make it to Nationals as a team.”",Jack Austin | Contributor,sports,https://www.redandblack.com/sports/cross_country/moving-ahead-bryan-kamau-leads-uga-cross-country-in-preparation/article_0744d62c-b4d7-11e7-816b-6b10f80dcaf7.html

22-Oct-17,Georgia deputy AD Carla Williams hired as Virginia athletic director,"Dr. Carla Williams, Georgia’s Deputy Director of Athletics, will be leaving Athens to take over as the new athletic director at the University of Virginia, Virginia president Teresa Sullivan announced Sunday.The 49-year-old Williams will be the first female African-American athletic director at a Power Five school.  Virginia and Williams will be entering into a five-year contract, which will pay Williams a base salary of $550,000 a year, plus incentives.


 


Williams, who has been with the Georgia Athletic Association since 2004, held the second-highest post in the Athletic Association, behind only Director of Athletics Greg McGarity.In her role as Deputy Director of Athletics, Williams was considered the administrator of the football and women’s basketball programs at Georgia and was responsible for a variety of aspects of the day-to-day operations of Georgia’s athletic programs, including business operations, compliance and event management.At Virginia, Williams will be replacing Craig Littlepage, who announced in September his intention to retire as the university’s director of athletics after more than 15 years in the position.Originally from LaGrange, Georgia, Williams attended Georgia in the late ‘80s and early ‘90s, playing basketball for the Bulldogs during her undergraduate years. Williams also served as an assistant coach on the women’s basketball team during the ‘90s.Williams spent time working in the athletic departments at both Florida State and Vanderbilt before returning to Georgia.Georgia has not announced who will replace Williams as deputy director of athletics.",Alex Soderstrom | Senior Staff Writer,sports,https://www.redandblack.com/sports/georgia-deputy-ad-carla-williams-hired-as-virginia-athletic-director/article_a7f710f6-b74f-11e7-a11e-130ab81f303d.html
22-Oct-17,Georgia volleyball player Rachel Ritchie's road to Athens,"After the announcer calls the starting lineup for the Georgia women’s volleyball team, No. 24 takes her place on the court.She lowers herself into her ready position waiting for the whistle to signal the start of the game. As the whistle blows, she takes a deep breath before exploding with a powerful kill just past the opponent’s outstretched arms. This No. 24 is freshman outside hitter, Rachel Ritchie. And kills like that are quite frequent for the 5-foot-11-inch California native. So far this season, she has recorded 289 kills, averaging 3.85 kill per set, for the Georgia offense, making her the team’s second-highest leading scorer.


 


Her performance on the court speaks on her value to the Bulldog team. However, her teammates vouch for the fact that this season’s Bulldog team would not be complete without Ritchie.

Amanda Dachs, a senior leader on the team, said that Richie brings a lot more to this team than kills, and that Ritchie’s her talkative personality keeps her team energized during matches and laughing outside of the gym.“We finally cracked her open and she is a ball of spunk,” said Dachs. “She’s got a really high volleyball IQ, so she is always talking. That makes our job a lot easier because she is constantly keeping us engaged.”Choosing volleyballThough she is a star of the Bulldogs’ offense, Ritchie was an unexpected volleyball star.Ritchie first picked up a volleyball the summer before her freshman year of high school. And she did not start playing because of her noticeable pure athleticism or because of her pure love of the sport.Self-described as “not very athletic and very quiet and shy” in her middle school years, Richie owes her collegiate volleyball career to her mom, who encouraged her to join a sports team to make friends.


 


“She grabbed me one day and said ‘you’re not going to have any friends in school if you don’t play a sport. You’re quiet, so you’re getting into something,’” Richie said.“We finally cracked her open and she is a ball of spunk. She’s got a really high volleyball IQ, so she is always talking.""-Amanda Dachs, senior volleyball player Taking her mother’s advice, Ritchie went to her first club volleyball practice with a friend who was already on the team. Not knowing much of the fundamentals during tryouts, the coach allowed her a spot on the team, but warned her that she probably would not play.“The first couple of weeks, I started getting mad that I wasn’t playing. Even though I had no idea what I was doing,” Ritchie said.That’s where her competitive nature kicked in. Ritchie’s practices became longer as she stayed late to trying to learn what most of her teammates had been doing for years.  She said she came in to make up for the time that she never had and trying to get in repetition.

“I was coming in after practice every day,” Ritchie said. “Learning the moves and learning what I was supposed to do, that’s where I fell in love with the sport.”Ritchie's road to GeorgiaThe collegiate recruiting process is hard enough the first time. For Ritchie, it took two rounds to finally land on Georgia as her university of choice.Ritchie originally committed to Loyola Marymount University in Los Angeles California her sophomore year in high school. At the time, she was committing to a university in her home state and with now Georgia head coach Tom Black.

All her plans were rocked when she got the phone call two months before she graduated high school that Black was leaving LMU and heading across the country to Athens, Ga.Deciding to open up her recruiting process once again, Ritchie said she was looking at tons of different schools but wanted to make sure she checked out Georgia, too.“The second time recruiting her was harder than the first,” Black said. “And it took forever. When she finally committed to us, it was a great day. We were really fired up about it.”

“The second time recruiting her was harder than the first. And it took forever. When she finally committed to us, it was a great day. We were really fired up about it.”-Tom Black, volleyball head coachComing from California, Ritchie said the thought of moving 1,900 miles from home had never crossed her mind. However, when she arrived in Athens, she could not get it out of her mind.“I fell in love with the campus, the coaches and the facilities,” Ritchie said. “Not wanting to rush into anything, I kept my mind open those last few weeks, but then I realized I was comparing every other school to Georgia.”Looking back, Ritchie said she was thankful that Black left LMU because it opened a lot of doors for her to look at other schools. Always wanting a big football school student population, and Georgia checked everything off her wish list.“When [Black] left, it opened the door to everything I wanted,” Ritchie said. “When I was committed to LMU, I said ‘oh I’ve got to go for the coaching.’ But with Georgia, I got everything I wanted. I got the coaching and the big school environment that I always wanted.”",Brittany Stewart | Contributor,sports,https://www.redandblack.com/sports/volleyball/georgia-volleyball-player-rachel-ritchie-s-road-to-athens/article_35fe01ce-b08a-11e7-9318-d391b0352dd1.html
23-Oct-17,Injury Report: Updates on 3 Georgia defenders,"Georgia is coming off a bye week that gave it time to rest and recover from the first seven games of the season before heading to Jacksonville, Florida, to play the Florida Gators.At Georgia’s weekly press conference on Monday, head coach Kirby Smart updated the status of some of those players that needed time to rest and recover.There are only two notable injuries on the team, both on the defense. Junior defensive tackle Daquan Hawkins-Muckle and sophomore outside linebacker David Marshall have both been dealing with undisclosed injuries, according to Smart.


 


Smart said Hawkins-Muckle is “still battling back” and Marshall is “cleared and ready to go.”Trenton Thompson, who has been dealing with a right knee sprain, is making progress, according to his head coach.""Trenton was able to practice and do mostly everything,"" Smart said.

24-Oct-17,Review: Blind Pilot envelops the Georgia Theatre with cathartic set,"On Monday, Oct. 23, around 9:20 p.m. the lights dimmed in the Georgia Theatre as Blind Pilot’s opening act Charlie Cunningham took the stage. Cunningham sat on a stool center stage lit up by a single spotlight. The numerous instruments belonging to Blind Pilot hidden in the shadowy edges of the stage contrasted with the visual simplicity of the single Spanish guitar Cunningham used throughout his set.

Although the crowd was largely unfamiliar with his music, his finger-picking based guitar playing was enchanting. Cunningham’s fingers nimbly floated over the strings as he played and added a percussive flair by tapping on the guitar’s body. The crowd seemed to hold its breath during each song, releasing only to cheer between the songs and for the occasional shout during. Although his accent revealed he was from England, Cunningham’s song “Lessleg” emphasized this with the lyrics “To be polite, we should be polite,” falling into English stereotype. 


 


To the cheers of the audience, Cunningham was joined for a duet with Blind Pilot’s vocalist Israel Nebeker at the end of his set. Together the two played Cunningham’s song “Lights Off,” which Cunningham said was the first time they were doing so at a show. For Cunningham’s last song, the rest of the Blind Pilot six piece joined Nebeker on stage with Cunningham to play “You Sigh” before all leaving the stage together.Rachel Hardegree, a freshman at the University of Georgia studying environmental science, said Cunningham was “surprisingly a lot better” than she thought he would be.When Blind Pilot came back onstage for its set, the crowd was greeted with the bouncy opener “The Story I Heard.” In the full, but still quiet, Georgia Theatre an audience member could be heard saying “Oh, this is a good song to start with.”The band played a mixture of songs from all three of its albums — before “Oviedo,” off of the band’s first album “3 Rounds and a Sound,” Nebeker told the story of how he sang it through the phone to his then girlfriend when he wrote it, but she didn’t like it. The same cannot be said of the audience, which happily swayed to all of the slower songs and bounced and sang along to the livelier ones. Not an audience that came to listen to just whatever live music was available, the crowd was notably invested in hearing and absorbing Blind Pilot’s live sound in particular — rowdier crowd members receiving both laughter and shushes for their playful calls.The six-piece band filled the Georgia Theatre with its intricate sound. Songs like “Umpqua Rushing” enveloped the audience, Nebeker’s voice, as smooth live as recorded, passionately moving through the song. Soothing in its gentleness and cathartic in its energy release, Blind Pilot’s set was enrapturing.The band stripped down to the trio of Kati Claborn, Israel Nebeker, and Luke Ydstie for “Just One” and “I Buried a Bone.” To the laughter of the audience, before the second song Ydstie tilted around his upright bass in which a rolling object could be heard – Ydstie said he thinks his and Claborn’s three year old daughter (who’s on tour with the band) dropped a toy like a block or Playmobil piece into it. The crowd, diversely filled with college and middle aged listeners alike, was endeared by the anecdote.

During “I Buried a Bone,” Dave Jorgensen accented the song with trumpet. The surprised crowd, which couldn’t place the sound at first, scrambled to find he was playing from the shadows of the balcony.“Half Moon” and particularly “3 Rounds and a Sound” received the greatest enthusiasm from the audience — the voice of the crowd rising up to join Nebeker’s.“3 Rounds and a Sound” was Hardagree’s favorite to hear live. She said she’s been listening to the Blind Pilot for about two years, and this was her first time seeing the band live.“It exceeded all my expectations,” she said of the concert.The final song on the main set was “We Are the Tide” which was one of the most active songs of the night. Claborn moved to play the drums with drummer and percussionist Ryan Dobrowski, adding a crashing brightness to the room. The enthusiasm of the band fully broke free during this song with every member dancing while playing his or her instrument.This concert was also the first time Sarah Thompson, a junior majoring in international affairs at UGA, saw Blind Pilot.“They're one of my fave bands recently, it was everything I wanted in life,” Thompson said.

Blind Pilot closed with a three song encore, the first of which featured Nebeker alone on acoustic guitar playing a new song. Labeled as “Choo Choo” on the setlist, Nebeker said he hopes the song makes it onto the band’s next album, which the band is already writing. The full band then played “New York” and closed with “One Red String” for which, to the audience’s excitement, and paralleling the end of his own set, Charlie Cunningham joined Blind Pilot.",Anna Haas | Staff Writer,culture,https://www.redandblack.com/culture/review-blind-pilot-envelops-the-georgia-theatre-with-cathartic-set/article_45a2ac04-b8bb-11e7-8c22-0f71fd01ae6a.html
24-Oct-17,On the road again: Traveling to games nothing new for Georgia safety J.R. Reed,"When the Bulldogs travel to Jacksonville, Florida, this week for their annual matchup with the Gators, it will be the second-longest trip Georgia football will take this season, after the rare trek the team made to South Bend in September.But the trip will be nothing compared to the journeys safety J.R. Reed made before transferring to Georgia, when he was still playing for Tulsa.Compare the 340-mile trip from Athens to Jacksonville to the away schedule Reed faced at Tulsa, and it doesn’t come close to qualifying for second place. Or third. Or even fourth.


 


With Tulsa’s away schedule from 2015 — the only year Reed played at the school — a 340-trip would be fifth, behind brutal expeditions from Tulsa, Oklahoma, to New Mexico, North Carolina, Ohio, and Louisiana.In his time at Tulsa, the redshirt sophomore traveled a combined 3,659 miles for away games. For comparison, the distance across the continental United States is less than 3,500 miles.By the season’s end, Georgia will have only traveled 1,867 miles for away games.But long trips don’t seem to faze Reed, especially when he gets to utilize his favorite mode of transportation: flying.“I love flying,” Reed said.At Tulsa, the team often was able to use airplanes to combat the grueling outings to other campuses. When the team heads down to Jacksonville, it will also be via plane, which is the perfect time for Reed to implement his in-flight ritual.“I pick out a real good movie I never seen before, and I just sit there and watch that,” Reed said. “I love flying.”As for any differences between flying at Tulsa as opposed to Georgia, besides the lengths of the trips, the main adjustment is the formal attire the Bulldogs have to wear when traveling.“We didn’t wear our suits [at Tulsa],” Reed said. “We just had our sweats on.”",Alex Soderstrom | Senior Staff Writer,sports,https://www.redandblack.com/sports/football/on-the-road-again-traveling-to-games-nothing-new-for/article_ea25ab26-b91c-11e7-bc52-5f4fccdac59a.html
25-Oct-17,Sony Michel to return to Jacksonville for final game against Florida,"Homecomings have not been kind to Sony Michel in his college career.The South Florida native and former American Heritage High School star has played three regular season games in his home state, all in Jacksonville against the Florida Gators. Michel’s numbers in those games are uncharacteristic to say the least.After missing the game against the Gators his freshman year with an injury, Michel ran for 45 yards on 13 carries in 2015. Last season, Michel picked up a measly two yards on three carries.


 


Now Michel is gearing up for his final shot at the Gators on Saturday in Jacksonville. But even though it’s his last chance to beat one of his home-state schools, Michel is trying not to place any extra emphasis on beating Florida.“Everybody, we love winning, I like winning,” Michel said. “It’s a goal of mine to just keep winning.”Michel won’t be the only American Heritage alumnus to take the field on Saturday, as three Florida players also played their high school football there. Michel said he probably knows freshman defensive lineman Tedarrell Slaton the best of the American Heritage players on the other side of the ball.But with that being said, Michel said there have been no conversations between him and any of the American Heritage Gators leading up to Saturday’s contest.Even though Jacksonville is over 300 miles from Plantation, Florida, where Michel attended high school, it’s just about as close as he plays to his family and friends with the exception of potential bowl games.“It’s awesome for them to be able to have a game not too far they can come to and watch,” Michel said.In the times his family has made the trek to Jacksonville, they have yet to see Michel walk off the field with a win. This year, he’s hoping that will change.“I would say it’s special, just the fact that it’s our last go-round, my last go-round,” Michel said. “I try to call this the victory lap, try to make this the best one.""",Jed May | Senior Staff Writer,sports,https://www.redandblack.com/sports/football/sony-michel-to-return-to-jacksonville-for-final-game-against/article_5e6cfdb4-b9df-11e7-bb26-9f5ac5b5f6df.html
27-Oct-17,The 10 best recruits in Georgia football history,"There are varying opinions among college football fans on the ever-changing world of recruiting, some good and some not so much, but there is no denying the importance it has on the success of a program.Georgia has long been viewed as a powerhouse in the realm of recruiting — albeit with some down years along the way. Overall though, from year to year and coach to coach, the Bulldogs have never seemed to have much difficulty reeling in some of top high school players in the country.But who are the best recruits Georgia has landed, or in this case the highest rated?

27-Oct-17,Ninth annual Wild Rumpus Parade & Spectacle expected to be biggest yet,"When it comes to Halloween in Athens, “wild rumpus,” is not just a phrase kept within the pages of the iconic children’s story “Where the Wild Things Are” by Maurice Sendak.For nearly a decade, over Halloween weekend, the celebratory concept behind the phrase has become reality in the Wild Rumpus Parade & Spectacle thanks to Timi Conley, the parade’s founder and Master of Ceremonies.Conley, a purveyor for all things social and fun combined, moved to Athens from Massachusetts, where he attended college and became skilled in the art of throwing parties. For the Wild Rumpus, the original premise is still the driving force behind the event’s longevity. Over Halloween weekend, throw a party which welcomes anyone and everyone who not only want to celebrate under the moon with thousands of friends, but celebrate the notion that for a night, a person can dress up and be whatever is they my want to be.

“The first event, which was nine years ago, it rained, and it was cold, but I turned the corner and there were 250 people there,” Conley said when asked about the event’s heyday.Since that time, the event has grown exponentially.“Last year we had upwards of 7,000 people, if not more who were part of the event and in attendance for it,” Conley said. This year’s event will be the biggest it’s ever seen.Festivities for the ninth annual Wild Rumpus Parade & Spectacle will start at noon on Friday, Oct. 27, beginning with a series of family-oriented events at The Foundry. However, once the sun goes down, The Foundry will also play host for the official kickoff party ushered in by rockabilly artist Unknown Hinson.This is The Foundry’s first time sponsoring the Wild Rumpus. Meredith Pittman, marketing coordinator for Graduate Athens, said that The Foundry reached out in the interest of further ingraining itself in Athens through the iconic Halloween event.“We’re really trying to get involved a little bit more in the community [and] they were one of our first choices for that,” Pittman said.

While The Foundry has hosted kid-friendly Rumpus events in the past, this is the first year that it will host the kickoff concert.“Friday’s going to be a really fun day with the kids and then the concert that night too,” Pittman said. “So far, [the Wild Rumpus] has been a really good partner for us.”Saturday will kick off with a “ghoul’ing” 5K MonsterDASH at 9 a.m. For parents searching for an outlet to rid their child of the Halloween sugar rush, the Fun Run is set to start at 8:45 a.m. Both events have a registration time of 7 a.m. outside of Creature Comforts Brewery.Live Wire Athens will host the Rumpus Rally, the pre-parade party which won’t stop until The Wild Rumpus Parade begins. The parade will start at the intersection of Hull and W. Hancock Street, ending on College Ave. directly in front of City Hall. At this point, anyone in attendance, along with 7,000-plus friends, will celebrate the parade’s culmination on one giant open-air dance floor in front of City Hall.

“The Wild Rumpus has a life of its own,” Conley said in reference to his response to those wondering what to expect or expressing slight uncertainty.However, a couple of things are fairly certain. This event is the perfect excuse to dance in the streets, dressed in costume, surrounded by old friends, simultaneously making new, all while howling in the moonlight. That alone should provide an overall feel-good vibe. If not, hopefully knowing that the proceeds from the Wild Rumpus event benefit the Non-Profit Partner, Athens Nurses Clinic, should.For more information regarding the Wild Rumpus Parade & Spectacle, please visit www.wildrumpus.org

28-Oct-17,UGA women's golf leads after the first day of the Ladies Fall Intercollegiate Invitational,"Georgia women’s golf team finished in first place after the opening round of the Ladies Fall Intercollegiate Invitational on Friday, Oct. 27.The team tallied a team score of 299 at 11 over par at the Atlanta Athletic Club in Johns Creek, GA. Georgia holds a three shot advantage over second place Louisville heading into the second round.Leading the team was junior Rinko Mitsunaga. She fired a par score of 72 to keep her level at the top of the leaderboard with Coastal Carolina’s Malene Krolboll Hansen.

Head coach Josh Brewer spoke very highly of Mitsunaga’s veteran performance on the day.“Rinko had a very Rinko-like day,” Brewer said. “She was just very consistent and hit a lot of fairways and a lot of greens. It was a really solid round of golf and her U.S. Open experience probably helped her today on a demanding, professional championship golf course.”Mitsunaga notched 14 pars while mixing two bogeys and two birdies through 18 holes.Along with Mitsunaga, sophomore Gabriella Coello shot one over par at 73 to finish tied for third overall and second on the team.Junior Jillian Hollis is tied for eighth overall in the tournament after scoring 75. She ended with the third best score on Georgia’s team.Freshman Paula Neira Garcia is currently tied for 27th in the tournament after shooting 78.Meanwhile senior, Isabella Skinner is tied for 33rd in the tournament with a first round score of 80.


 


Rounding up the team freshmen Stephanie Carras and Elisa Yang tied for 45th overall in the tournament with both sharing the same score of 82.Carras and Yang are competing as individuals for the tournament.

Overall, Brewer continued to praise his team after one of its best rounds of the season so far.“It was a very good start for both the team and Rinko and Gaby, individually,” Brewer said. “It’s the first time we’ve had a lead this year, so it will be nice to sleep on that and hopefully we’ll repeat that the next two days.”",Quentin VanHoozer | Contributor,sports,https://www.redandblack.com/sports/golf/uga-women-s-golf-leads-after-the-first-day-of/article_208a4d60-bbe4-11e7-a068-ef7567d7c01c.html
29-Oct-17,Georgia falls to Michigan State in exhibition for hurricane relief,"The Georgia men's basketball team traveled to Grand Rapids, Michigan, on Sunday afternoon for a matchup with one of the nation's best teams.The Bulldogs took on the Michigan State Spartans, ranked No. 2 in the USA Today Coaches Poll, in a charity exhibition game and fell by a score of 80-68.The two schools split the proceeds 50/50, with Georgia donating its half to the American Red Cross of Georgia and Michigan State giving its portion to the Red Cross - International Services.


 


“When you do something for a cause greater than yourself, you need help to really make an impact, and this couldn’t have happened without Michigan State University and the great support that their fan base and the city of Grand Rapids provided,” Georgia head coach Mark Fox said.On the court, Georgia fell short, though, in a performance that saw few players, other than senior forward Yante Maten, make a substantial impact.Maten scored 33 of the Bulldogs' 68 points while shooting 9-for-19 from the field and grabbed four rebounds. His Spartan counterpart, sophomore forward Miles Bridges, put up 21 points and grabbed 10 rebounds to lead the Spartans to a win.The Bulldogs hung with the Spartans in the first half, despite going down 9-2 early on, but Michigan State pulled ahead by a 40-31 margin heading into halftime. Georgia was able to cut the deficit to 42-37 early in the second half before the Spartans pulled away to secure a comfortable win.Georgia struggled to help Maten in this game, as no other player scored in double figures.True freshman forward Nicolas Claxton was the second-leading scorer for the Bulldogs, as he scored nine points in just 14 minutes of play while also grabbing four rebounds and blocking a shot.It was the perimeter players that were battling for the playing time in this game, as there is an open competition for starting spots from point guard to small forward, and no man really stood out.The Bulldogs went with a starting five of Maten, Derek Ogbeide, E'Torrion Wilridge, Rayshaun Hammonds and William Jackson II in a lineup with a lot of size.


 


But Jackson had a miserable offensive day, going 0-for-7 from the floor in a scoreless outing. The junior did notch four assists. Hammonds, a highly touted freshman from Norcross, made his only shot and finished with two points.Bench guards Tyree Crump and Teshaun Hightower, both of whom are competing for the starting point guard spot with Jackson, were both quiet. Crump scored seven points on eight shot attempts and Hightower, a freshman, had just two points in 14 minutes.Senior guard Juwan Parker came off of the bench in this game and scored six points and had two assists in 16 minutes.Ogbeide is a mainstay in the starting lineup and did his job while notching six points and seven rebounds in just 15 minutes of play and made all three of his field goal attempts.Overall, Georgia shot just 40.4 percent from the field to Michigan State's 50 percent and the Bulldogs struggled mightily from the perimeter as they shot 22.2 percent from three-point range.“I think this game will be terrific for us,” Fox continued. “We scrimmaged somebody Friday night, so we had a quick turn around and obviously a big test against a very complete and terrific basketball team...So I think, if we can utilize it the right way, I think this will have been a terrific experience for our team.""",Collin Huguley | Staff Writer,sports,https://www.redandblack.com/sports/mens_basketball/georgia-falls-to-michigan-state-in-exhibition-for-hurricane-relief/article_ece3c4a0-bd0a-11e7-952c-8fd7c6ca3445.html
30-Oct-17,Georgia's defense has been a consistent staple to its 8-0 start to season,"Georgia’s defense was supposed to be strong this season. But it’s been more than that. It’s been dominant.Georgia is only giving up an average of 12 points per game. That’s good enough to rank third nationally. It is also giving up just 4.2 yards per play and just over 250 yards per game.“As a defense you don’t want people to score on you,” senior outside linebacker Davin Bellamy said. “So when you get to the fourth quarter, and they’ve got zero, that’s kind of what you’re pushing for.”


 


Georgia shut out Tennessee earlier this season and nearly shut out Mississippi State and Florida. Late touchdowns, or a field goal in Mississippi State’s case, kept the Bulldogs from doing that.Still, eyes go straight to two defenders when looking for who’s responsible for the defense's consistency -- junior inside linebacker Roquan Smith and senior outside linebacker Lorenzo Carter.Smith leads the team with 61 tackles, 34 of which are solo tackles. He’s also accounted for one sack. Carter may not have as many tackles, but he’s contributed in other ways. He has four sacks this season, two forced fumbles and three fumble recoveries.Helping Georgia to an 8-0 record with smothering defense has landed them both on the list of finalists for the Butkus Award, given to the best linebacker in the nation.“They both work hard,” head coach Kirby Smart said. “I think some of the team offense, defense and special teams success can lead to some recognition, but to win it you have to play well. You have to certainly be a very productive player, and both of those young men have been that.”The thing that gets Smith, Carter and the rest of the defense to be so productive is how prepared it is. Between watching film on the opposing offense, looking at every defensive touchdown in college football from the previous week and going through plays with the scout team, Georgia's coaching staff ensures the defense gets as thorough preparation as possible.“It’s like a two-hour walk through and we simulate everything that goes into the game.” Bellamy said. “Coach Smart does an unbelievable job in just simulating and I guess I could attest to that because we rehearse all week.And despite the results and accolades the Georgia defense has piled up through the first eight weeks of the season, its greatest pride may be what happened on Saturday against Florida.Halfway through the third quarter, Tyrique McGhee came up with a sack on Florida quarterback Feleipe Franks. Franks fumbled the ball, and Reed picked it up and walked it into the endzone to take a 35-0 lead.So today, Georgia’s defense will be on that film of defensive touchdowns from every college game for the first time this season.“We’re definitely going to watch it today in film as a team,” Carter said. “It’s going to be amazing because we always see the other teams scoring, but we’re finally going to be on the reel, and that’s amazing. It’s going to be hype.”",Layne Saliba | Senior Staff Writer,sports,https://www.redandblack.com/sports/football/georgia-s-defense-has-been-a-consistent-staple-to-its/article_c6cffc5c-bda5-11e7-b885-f71e4a7b0403.html
30-Oct-17,"Georgia offensive line looks to its mistakes, not successes, for improvement","Eight games into the 2017 season, Georgia’s offensive line is making a strong case as the most improved unit for the No. 2 Bulldogs.Georgia is currently 10th in the nation in rushing offense, running for an average of 284 yards per game, according to the NCAA. Last season, the Bulldogs finished the season ranked 50th in the country, averaging below 200 rushing yards per game.A major reason for that drastic improvement is the strides made by the offensive line, a unit that struggled often in 2016. Despite the advancements along the offensive line, offensive guard Solomon Kindley said the unit rarely celebrates the successes it has each game, such as the 292 yards and four touchdowns the Bulldogs picked up on the ground against Florida on Saturday.


 


“We always capitalize on our mistakes,” Kindley said. “Every game, we can pretty much say we had something to do, something to work on.”After every game, Kindley said, the coaches point out each missed step and blocking assignment the offensive line left on the field. According to Kindley, a redshirt freshman, it’s a mentality promoted at all levels of the unit, from position coach Sam Pittman to veteran players, such as seniors Isaiah Wynn and Dyshon Sims and junior Lamont Gaillard.When looking back at film, the veteran linemen aren’t afraid to call out their teammates if they missed a play, Kindley said.“That’s the type of room that you need to have to have a good team,” Kindley said.At a press conference on Monday, head coach Kirby Smart said there have been no significant schematic changes for the offensive line as opposed to last season. Instead, it seems players have simply stepped up their level of play.Against South Carolina on Saturday, the offensive line will face a Gamecock defense allowing only 137 rushing yards per game. But as the unit prepares this week, it will look back on each shortcoming from the Florida matchup, learning how to improve for the next game.“If your offensive line is doing good, that makes your team good,” Kindley said. “That’s just our biggest thing. If we’re doing good, the team’s doing good.”",Alex Soderstrom | Senior Staff Writer,sports,https://www.redandblack.com/sports/football/georgia-offensive-line-looks-to-its-mistakes-not-successes-for/article_5ba83734-bdb2-11e7-839b-2b809e20504d.html
30-Oct-17,Practice Report: Defensive lineman returns to practice,"The Georgia football team held a practice on Monday. Here are some observations as made by The Red & Black during the media viewing time.Main takeaways:Junior defensive tackle Daquan Hawkins-Muckle was back on the practice field today during the media viewing portion of practice. Hawkins-Muckle suffered an undisclosed injury the week before Georgia played Missouri.


 


And with that, Georgia is just about at full capacity health-wise.After a few weeks with injuries scattered throughout the offense and defense, the Bulldogs now have all of their starters back. The only exception is inside linebacker Natrez Patrick, who is serving a suspension for a misdemeanor marijuana arrest. Other Notes:The wide receivers were practicing catching the ball while scout team defenders were in their faces. The coaches lobbed the ball and the receiver had to leap above the defender and snatch the ball out of the air.",Layne Saliba and Alex Soderstrom,sports,https://www.redandblack.com/sports/football/practice-report-defensive-lineman-returns-to-practice/article_bc325e0e-bdb7-11e7-804f-e78f6f16f426.html
30-Oct-17,"Against Florida, Reggie Carter returns from injury with a bang","With 9:12 left in the first quarter of Georgia’s 42-7 win over Florida on Saturday, Georgia linebacker Reggie Carter made sure the Gator offense felt his presence.Florida quarterback Feleipe Franks took the snap at the 25-yard line and dropped back, dumping a short pass off to wide receiver Brandon Powell. As soon as Powell caught the pass at the 24-yard line, however, he was met by Carter, who wrapped Powell up and knocked him back five yards.After the hit, Carter stood up and hopped around the field.


 


“When I got up I was just like, ‘Yeah, it feels good to be back,’” Carter said.After seeing the force of the hit Carter applied on that play, one of four tackles he was credited with in Saturday’s game, it’s hard to imagine that only a few weeks before, the senior was sitting it a pitch-black room, with a sheet covering his windows, trying to overcome a concussion.On Sept. 30, Carter went down after a collision in Georiga’s game against Tennessee. After getting up, Carter said he tried to walk to the sideline but started veering off to the right as he walked across the grass at Neyland Stadium.“I saw Coach Smart, like, having his hand out, like ‘Get down,’” Carter said. “That’s the only thing I could see.”After that game, Carter was absent from practice for two weeks, working with the coaches and medical staff to pull off what Carter called a “rough” recovery process.“They assured me when I feel good, that’s when I can come back and play,” Carter said.Carter returned to practice during Georgia’s bye week. At that point, the road to recovery ended and the road to working back into the rotation began.After each practice during the bye week and the week leading up to the Florida game, Carter said he stayed after practice for extra runs in order to condition himself and return to his pre-injury form.But the toughest part of the process, Carter said, was watching his team from the sideline.“It hurts watching your team play,” Carter said.Carter’s absence largely coincided with the suspension of fellow inside linebacker Natrez Patrick, who has missed every game since the matchup with Vanderbilt, making Carter missed even more by the Bulldog defense.As much as it pained Carter to not be able to play during his injury, he said he was impressed with how freshman Monty Rice and junior Juwan Taylor performed filling in at the MIKE linebacker spot.“All the young guys, they played phenomenal,” Carter said. “Even when I got back, they built up on what they did did the previous weeks, and they just kept getting better.”When he returned against Florida, Carter had one of his best games of the season. But fellow linebacker Davin Bellamy said he wasn’t surprised Carter was motivated to play well against the Gators.“He’s another one of those guys that hadn’t beat Florida,” Bellamy said. “So he just brought that senior leadership.”Against South Carolina on Saturday, Carter will likely make another start, as Patrick will still be serving his suspension. For the senior, the opportunity to start in Sanford Stadium has a special importance attached to it.“I only got two home games left, and this is one of them,” Carter said. “I look forward to the atmosphere and the fans.”Injuries are nothing new to Carter. He also sustained a concussion last season, as well as a season-ending knee injury in 2015 and a knee injury in high school.The injuries, and Carter’s ability to bounce back from them, have made an impact on head coach Kirby Smart.“He’s an incredible kid when you think about it,” Smart said. “With his knees and shoulders… [he’s] always been a really good player.”When asked if injuries have ever pushed him towards giving up on football altogether, Carter’s answer was an unequivocal “never.”“Those guys, the coaches and my teammates, they’re my family,” Carter said. “I don’t want to quit on my family.”",Alex Soderstrom | Senior Staff Writer,sports,https://www.redandblack.com/sports/football/against-florida-reggie-carter-returns-from-injury-with-a-bang/article_780f9252-bda6-11e7-81ca-3f27099d6972.html

1-Nov-17,"Concert Review: New York band, TAUK, opens for Athens band Perpetual Groove on Halloween","The Athens band Perpetual Groove returned to the Georgia Theatre to play a special Halloween set with New York band TAUK.At the Georgia Theatre’s Halloween show last night, the New York band TAUK opened up the night with an intense, almost-two hour long set.What was immediately noticeable about TAUK was the stage lighting: colorful rays and bands of light would move in time to the band’s special brand of jam rock. The band itself got into the Halloween spirit, themselves wearing masks from Jason from “Friday the 13th” to a classic Guy Fawkes mask.


 


The first song the band played had people moving to the music, which was a funny sight being that most people in the standing room area of the theatre were wearing Halloween costumes, a real monster mash. As the song progressed, the intensity was amped up, and Latin rhythm and some synthesizer wizardry found its way into the song.Most of the the set had songs like this, incorporating psychedelic sounds and Latin rhythm, even sometimes hip-hop drum intros. The crowd was really into it, egging on the band to turn up the intensity even more as a song would go on. The band itself didn’t really move around the stage much; they seemed to prefer for the music to do the talking.At close to two hours long, TAUK’s set, while musically sound, sometimes lost the crowd’s interest. Not everyone was into long, progressive jams so several people headed for the door after some time. For the most part though, the band had everyone’s attention, especially when some members from the headliners Perpetual Groove joined them on stage for the final song.The long time Athens staple, Perpetual Groove,opened with a slower song with Cher’s “Bang Bang (My Baby Shot Me Down),” easing into its set. The band’s songs were covers of songs featured in Quentin Tarantino movies, so the band dubbed its performance Scarantino in honor of Halloween and the director.The band promptly followed it up with Dick Dale’s energetic classic “Miserlou,” a roaring surf rock jam that had to crowd in fits. The band even had a horn section on stage, really doing the song justice. The band’s outfit was just as sharp as its music, with every member wearing full suits on stage.A set mainly of covers, Perpetual Groove put its own spin on bluesy, pub rock on all the songs. “Stuck In The Middle With You” was a real throwdown, and the band’s cover of Chuck Berry’s “You Never Can Tell” only escalated the crowd’s excited.Perpetual Groove put on an enjoyable set of familiar songs for the Georgia Theatre, and Halloween at the Georgia Theatre seemed to be an overall spooky success.",Hamilton Armit | Contributor,culture,https://www.redandblack.com/culture/concert-review-new-york-band-tauk-opens-for-athens-band/article_217e3b52-bf11-11e7-8078-f71ad8492c7a.html

South Carolina at No. 1 Georgia


 


Georgia has torn through every Southeastern Conference opponent it’s gone up against like tissue paper so far this season, and that doesn’t figure to change against a Deebo Samuel-less Gamecock team which has to travel to Athens on Saturday. South Carolina simply doesn't have the talent in the trenches to win the line of scrimmage consistently on either side of the ball, and the Gamecocks certainly don't have the depth defensively to keep up with Georgia's exceptional stable of running backs. The only real loser from this game is the environment, as the carbon pollution the South Carolina buses will produce on the round trip from Columbia, South Carolina, to Athens is completely unnecessary. — Nathan Berg picks Georgia to beat South Carolina 63-3No. 21 Stanford at No. 25 Washington StateThis game depends solely on Bryce Love. He’s one of the best backs in the country (competing with Saquon Barkley for the Heisman), and can take over games in an instant. He didn’t play last week because of an ankle injury, but if he’s cleared to play against Washington State, the Cardinal will win a close one. — Layne Saliba picks Stanford to beat Washington State 34-28No. 4 Clemson at No. 20 NC StateNorth Carolina State is currently a game ahead of Clemson in the ACC Atlantic standings, but the battle-tested Tigers, who have two wins over teams currently in the College Football Playoff rankings, will vault over the Wolfpack on Saturday. Clemson boasts a top-10 defense, and the last time NC State faced a good defense, this past Saturday against Notre Dame, the Wolfpack offense was stifled in a 35-14 loss. — Alex Soderstrom picks Clemson to beat NC State 24-20Clemson quarterback Kelly Bryant has tallied an impressive amount of passing yards this season, but the Tigers’ offense hasn’t been able to blow out many unranked foes. Clemson, the team that went on to win the national title, needed overtime to defeat NC State last year in Death Valley. This year, NC State comes in as the No. 20 team in the nation, and the Wolfpack has an elite defensive line that could disrupt the first-year starting quarterback’s game. Playing this game at home, I think NC State will get some revenge and have a close win over the Tigers.— Emily Giambalvo picks NC State to beat Clemson 28-21No. 5 Oklahoma at No. 11 Oklahoma StateAfter allowing 16 points to Ohio State in a 31-16 win, Oklahoma’s defense has given up 33 points per game in its last five contests with Power 5 opponents. Now the Sooners have to face Oklahoma State’s high-powered attack, and in Stillwater no less. Chalk this one up as a shootout win for the Cowboys. — Jed May picks Oklahoma State to beat Oklahoma 48-38

2-Nov-17,Caliya Robinson named to Preseason All-SEC second team,"Georgia women’s basketball junior Caliya Robinson was named to the 2017 Preseason All-Southeastern Conference Second Team on Nov. 1.Robinson ranks in the top-10 of returning scorers and rebounders in the SEC. She finished the 2016-17 season ranked third in the conference with 69 total blocks. As a sophomore, she finished second on the team in points per game with 13.7 and first on the team in field goal percentage and defensive rebounds.In her sophomore season last year, Robinson finished strong, averaging close to 16 points and over eight rebounds per game over the last 10 games. She was named the ESPNW National Player of the Week in February, having scored 20 points in a game at Arkansas and 28 points in a double-overtime win over Tennessee.


 


“Caliya’s numbers speak for themselves,” head coach Joni Taylor said. “To rank in the top-10 in scoring and rebounding in this league is a huge accomplishment. What we have talked to Caliya about this season is being consistent. She has worked extremely hard since the end of last year to do that, and you can see the growth and maturity she is now displaying.”",Janey Murray | Staff Writer,sports,https://www.redandblack.com/sports/womens_basketball/caliya-robinson-named-to-preseason-all-sec-second-team/article_5a754ad0-bffd-11e7-b5e4-77628b44850a.html

6-Nov-17,Jake Fromm will have experience on his side in road test against Auburn,"Just over two months ago this wasn’t even Jake Fromm’s team. He was the backup quarterback who would presumably be standing on the sidelines most of the time while the year-two version of Jacob Eason led Georgia’s offense.Then, Eason injured his knee, Fromm took over and the freshman-led offense won the game. The next week, Fromm won again and then seven more times after that, too.“He has to be a leader,” running back Sony Michel said. “He's the quarterback of this team, and I think he's done a great job of playing that role.”


 


Fromm’s first test came early in the form of a night game on the road against Notre Dame, a team that’s now ranked No. 3 in the College Football Playoff standings. But at the time, the week-two matchup was between No. 15 Georgia and No. 24 Notre Dame. So if these current rankings at least somewhat hold, that early game didn’t get quite the fanfare it warranted.Based on week-of-the-game rankings, Georgia’s game on Saturday will be its toughest matchup yet, as the AP poll has this as a game between the No. 2 Bulldogs and No. 10 Auburn. The College Football Playoff rankings, which come out on Tuesday, will likely have this game pegged as a similar battle. Last week, Georgia topped those standings, while Auburn stood at No. 14.Similar to how he did in South Bend, Indiana, Fromm will manage this game on the road at Jordan-Hare Stadium, a place Smart’s Alabama team frequently played.“I think playing in that Notre Dame environment was really good for him because that was one of the tougher environments,” Smart said. “Early in the Tennessee game was that way. He continues to improve each day, and this will be another tough environment.”But Smart said the young quarterback hasn’t been “intimidated by the moment.”Only once has a true freshman quarterback led his team to a national title, as Oklahoma’s Jamelle Holieway did so in 1985. If Georgia continues winning and finds its way into the College Football Playoff, Fromm would have a chance to be the second. Alabama’s Jalen Hurts nearly accomplished that feat last year when the Crimson Tide lost to Clemson in the national championship game.Fromm has been in a favorable position to lead the offense as a true freshman thanks to how high school programs have continued to develop, Smart said. Because of that, Fromm came into Georgia already comfortable throwing the ball and reading defenses, which he’s had to do for Georgia this year through run-pass option plays.“He has to make good decisions,” Smart said. “He has to execute the plan. He has to be able to give the playmakers the ball. As long as he does those things and makes good decisions, we are a pretty good football team.”This weekend, linebacker Reggie Carter expects Fromm will benefit from the experience he gained in his first start against Notre Dame. This will again be a road game against ranked opponents.Depending on the game, Fromm has had to throw the ball anywhere from seven to 29 times. At times, the run game has carried the offense, and on other days Georgia has had a more balanced attack. But heading into the Auburn matchup, every game with Fromm behind center has ended in the same way — a Georgia win.“He's been the guy we need for our team,” Carter said.",Emily Giambalvo | Senior Staff Writer,sports,https://www.redandblack.com/sports/football/jake-fromm-will-have-experience-on-his-side-in-road/article_fe9a5e90-c334-11e7-ab8d-2f0bfd289510.html
7-Nov-17,Practice Report: Observations from the second UGA practice before Auburn game,"The Georgia football team held a practice on Tuesday. Here are some observations as made by The Red & Black during the media viewing time.It was another quiet day of practice for a No. 1 Georgia team which is about as healthy as it could be going into a road matchup against No. 10 Auburn.The theme of the day seemed to be impressive catches from sophomore players, at least during the periods of practice open to the media. First, during the initial open period, second-year receiver Riley Ridley pulled off a reaching one-handed grab down the sideline without ever touching the ball with any other part of his body. It was one of many big plays Ridley has made of late in practice, although his week-day success has yet to translate to bigger stat lines on Saturdays.


 


Later on in practice, sophomore defensive back Tyrique McGhee pulled a deep ball down with one hand while the DBs were practicing tracking balls on defense.Meanwhile, the quarterbacks spent the early part of the open period continuing to work on RPO plays. On a few snaps, quarterback Jake Fromm practiced handing the ball off to running back Elijah Holyfield while faking a QB keeper towards the other side of the field.Additional notes:- The tight ends were working on blocking technique and aim. On certain reps, they were instructed to strike a tackle bag at chest level, while at other times they dove lower at the bag.- Meanwhile, the defensive backs focused on staying alert while maintaining coverage. They practiced keeping each other covered, until a ball was rolled towards them on a rep. At that point, they were to bail out of coverage and recover the hypothetical fumble.",Nathan Berg,sports,https://www.redandblack.com/sports/football/practice-report-observations-from-the-second-uga-practice-before-auburn/article_55cc6a2c-c403-11e7-9f45-8b065f7b150a.html

8-Nov-17,Beating Jake Fromm: A look back at the last time the freshman quarterback lost a game,"With a win over South Carolina on Nov. 4, Georgia quarterback Jake Fromm stretched his winning streak in football games to a full calendar year. His last loss came on Nov. 4 of 2016 against Valdosta High School in the final game of his high school career.Since then, Fromm has put together eight straight wins as a starter. He also played most of a ninth, as he came into the season’s opening game against Appalachian State in the first quarter due to an injury to incumbent starter Jacob Eason.Since arriving in Athens, Fromm has yet to experience loss.


 


So what does it take to beat Jake Fromm?“I don’t think you can beat him, I’ll be honest with you,” said Von Lassiter, Fromm’s coach at Houston County High School.“I don’t think you can beat him, I’ll be honest with you.""-Von Lassiter, Houston County High School football coach And while it may be a difficult task, it’s not an impossible one. Fromm was not undefeated in his high school years, experiencing 12 losses over his four year career with Houston County.Lassiter said the only way teams found success against his team when Fromm was at the helm was by keeping him off the field. Since Houston County’s defense was the weaker side of its team, long, deflating drives by its opponents were the keys to opposing schools knocking off the Bears.“You’d better try to focus on the other side of the ball,” Lassiter said. “You’d better slow him down enough. You’d better keep him off the field.”Fromm’s 12th and final loss of his high school career came at the hands of the Valdosta High School Wildcats. The game was the final one of the 2016 season, with Houston County needing a win to clinch a playoff spot.Fromm also had a chance to make a little history of his own.“He had a chance, I think, to break Deshaun Watson’s record that night,” said Alan Rodemaker, head coach for Valdosta. “We also had some extra motivation because he could have broke the passing [yardage] record that night for the state of Georgia.”Fromm hadn’t played Valdosta before, so Rodemaker went to other coaches for advice. What he heard wasn’t encouraging.“Most coaches that went against him his last couple years felt like he was the best they’d ever played against,” Rodemaker said.The week before playing Valdosta, Fromm had suffered a separated shoulder. So Rodemaker said his gameplan going in was to blitz Fromm and put pressure on him.However, that didn’t work out very well. In Rodemaker’s words, Fromm “scorched” the Wildcats in the first half en route to a 21-7 halftime lead.In the second half, Rodemaker changed his strategy. He instead opted to only rush four and drop the rest of his defenders in coverage.“I think just being able to drop seven and eight guys just really helped us, helped cloud his vision a little bit,” Rodemaker said.With the Houston County offense neutralized, Valdosta was able to come back and thwart the Bears’ playoff hopes with a 28-24 victory.Fromm completed 18 of his 28 passes for 174 yards. His career ended with 12,821 yards, just short of Watson’s 13,077.Rodemaker may have coached the team that ended Fromm’s prep career. But at an Atlanta Touchdown Club banquet later in the school year, the Valdosta coach foreshadowed events to come for the Warner Robins native.“I just told him I was pulling for him, I told him to go win the job,” Rodemaker said. “From everything I heard about the guy, I just felt like he could win it... he’s just a master competitor.”",Jed May and Nathan Berg,sports,https://www.redandblack.com/sports/football/beating-jake-fromm-a-look-back-at-the-last-time/article_847726d6-c454-11e7-ad90-7f8a4f27b503.html

9-Nov-17,Caliya Robinson named to 2018 Katrina McClain Award watch list,"Georgia women’s basketball junior forward Caliya Robinson has been named to the inaugural Katrina McClain Award preseason watch list.The award, which recognizes the top power forward in NCAA Division I women’s college basketball, is named for former Georgia basketball player Katrina McClain, a two-time All-American, the Women’s Basketball Coaches Association National Player of the Year in 1987 and a three-time Olympian.The award is in its first year of existence. Robinson is one of 20 players named to the preseason watch list. In March, the selection committee, which is composed of media members, head coaches, sports information directors and Hall of Famers, will narrow the list down to five finalists. The winner will be announced during the 2018 NCAA Women’s Final Four.


 


On Nov. 1, Robinson was named to the Preseason All-Southeastern Conference Second Team.Robinson ranks in the top-10 of returning scorers and rebounders in the SEC and had a strong finish to her sophomore season, averaging close to 16 points and over eight rebounds per game over the last 10 games.

10-Nov-17,Georgia women's basketball to look to its seniors for leadership this season,"As one of the first of many lasts this year, seniors Haley Clark, Simone Costa and Mackenzie Engram will suit up for their final season opener as members of the women’s basketball team Nov. 12.But there is still an entire season ahead of them — time to make their final mark on the team before the season ends. Heading into the first game against Wofford College, their focus is not on a season of lasts, but about finishing their careers at Georgia strong.“I’m just trying to bring my best game for my teammates and be there for them on the court and off the court,” senior guard Simone Costa said.


 


The three work to set a high example for the underclassmen and new freshmen coming into the program. Head coach Joni Taylor said they lead by their example, some using their voice when needed.Both Engram and Clark have been a part of the women’s basketball program for four years. Taylor said from the first day both came into the program wanting to be an integral part on the athletic side, but also on the academic and service-oriented side. Both work in leadership organizations on campus, leaving a legacy on campus on and off the court, Taylor said.Costa, originally from Lisbon, Portugal, transferred from junior college and began at Georgia as a junior. Her presence on the team as a leader began from the start, in the 2016-2017 season, and it has continued into this year.“I can call on any of them to get things done, to do things for me, to be the role model that I need them to be on the floor,” Taylor said. “Just really expect big things from them this year, and I’m just cheering them on because they have done everything right, so they deserve to go out the right way.”The senior’s ability to step up for Taylor has also translated into the team and their relationships with the underclassmen. Sophomore forward Stephanie Paul said the trio’s ability to communicate well with their teammates in practice or getting extra workouts in and inviting the underclassmen sets an example for the other team members.When they are struggling in practice or a coach is yelling at a player, freshman Gabby Connally said the seniors know how to help them through that difficult moment in practice and to keep pushing until the end.Their care for the freshmen also has been realized by the newcomers to the team.“I know from my personal experience I spend a lot of time with some of the seniors, especially Haley Clark,” Connally said. “She played the position last year, the point guard position. So she has been teaching me a lot, encouraging me along the way, getting better. And things I have questions with, she’s always there to help.”


 


Off the court, the members of the basketball team spend time together building relationships and bonds that translate onto the court. Members of the team have gone on outings outside of practice like to the movies, to roller-skate, to get their nails done or to get a bite to eat.Sometimes, they even get a little creative. A group of five of the teammates—including both Connally, Paul and a few upperclassmen—turned a regular movie night into something special.“I know one thing I really wanted to do was to have a movie night and build a fort, and we like made that happen which was really cool,” Connally said.These off-the-court moments help to create strong bonds that will then translate to the team’s presence on the court. With the seniors leading the charge, Taylor said her expectation for the trio as the season continues is to lead the team through their examples.“I expect them to hold the rope when things get tough,” Taylor said. “Because that is going to happen pretty quickly for us our non-conference schedule is very challenging. And so when things get shaky, when they get tough, when times get hard, whatever that is, I expect them to be the ones to pull us out with their positive example.”",Kelsey Russo | Assistant Sports Editor,sports,https://www.redandblack.com/sports/womens_basketball/georgia-women-s-basketball-to-look-to-its-seniors-for/article_0c11feb6-c62d-11e7-8d2b-133a0998ba08.html

To help cut down on the cost of buying new winter clothes, why not create your own?The Athens-Clarke County Library will partnered with Revival Yarns is hosting an “Outlander Knit-Along” on Nov. 4, 11 and 18 which lets people come and learn how to knit while discussing the popular series “Outlander.”“Anyone can come and hang out and just talk about the book and the series while we’re all working on the same project,” said Lindsay Woodson, co-owner of Revival Yarns.


 


At the event, people will learn how to knit Claire’s cowl. Claire is the main character of the show ""Outlander,"" and in the show she wears a rustic cowl. A cowl is like an infinity scarf, said Rhiannon Eades, public information officer for the Athens-Clarke County Library.This event gives fans the opportunity to create this article of clothing for themselves while discussing the series.“It’s a great opportunity to come and socialize while you’re working on a project,” Eades said.The event is open to people of all ages and any level of knitting experience. If a person has never knitted before, there are 10 spots available for reservation and someone from Revival Yarns will help teach that person to knit Claire’s cowl.“It’s a great opportunity to learn,” Eades said. “Someone from Revival Yarns will be there to help you learn how to knit.”The pattern is great for beginners because it is just one simple stitch, Eades said. People will need to bring their own supplies which is size 35 knitting needles and super bulky yarn.Each class lasts one hour, 4-5 p.m., and they are held at the library. Because the stitch is so simple, many of the experienced knitters had to stop or else they would finish too quickly, Woodson said.


 


The event is free, and the library will provide coffee and cookies, so it’s a real cozy atmosphere, Woodson said.This event is one of several the library is hosting leading up to its big event on December 2, “Outlandish in Athens,” which will be a day long celebration of the ""Outlander"" series.The idea for the event came from the fact that tons of people around Athens are fans of both the book and television series, Eades said.“Outlandish in Athens” will have attractions such as Scottish country dancing, bagpipes and lectures, and all of these events will be free, Eades said.Everyone is invited to come out and learn to knit for free while also creating a fashionable accessory.",Casey McDonald | Staff Writer,culture,https://www.redandblack.com/culture/athens-clarke-county-library-offers-outlander-themed-knitting-class/article_e582b782-c6e9-11e7-bfbb-4779fde34a16.html
11-Nov-17,Georgia’s offense and defense both affected by three-and outs,"AUBURN, Ala. - Coming into Saturday’s matchup with Auburn, third downs had been a strong point for the Georgia offense. The Bulldogs entered the game converting 51.2 percent of their third downs.But against the Tigers, that all changed.Georgia converted on just three of its 14 third downs. But the real problems arose in the lack of first downs on some drives. Five times in the game, the Bulldogs went three-and-out.


 


“They’ve got an unbelievable defense, and they were flying to the ball,” senior receiver Javon Wims said. “But it’s a lot of things we were doing wrong that we normally don’t do.”The biggest stretch of drives with no first downs came in the first half. The Bulldogs started a drive on their own 47-yard line with a 7-6 lead.The offense then went three-and-out on its next three possessions, picking up a grand total of four yards in the process. By the time the Bulldogs picked up their next first down with under four minutes remaining in the first half, Auburn had gone from trailing 7-6 to leading 16-7.In the second half, two more three-and-outs resulted in two subsequent Tiger drives that tallied 10 points.“It puts too much pressure on the defense,” Wims said. ""We’ve got to do a better job of not putting ourself in that situation.”However, junior linebacker Roquan Smith was quick to deflect the blame from his offensive counterparts.“Well you can’t blame them or anything like that,” Smith said. “It all boils back down to the defense and when we’re out there on the field and how we’re going to stop them. They scored the points on us, they didn’t score on the offense, so it is what it is from that aspect.”But the scoreboard doesn’t lie: on the Auburn drives immediately following a three-and-out, the Tigers scored 20 points.


 


One of the biggest problems Georgia faced was constantly being faced with second-and-long. On the five drives with no first downs, on average, the Bulldogs were faced with second-and-7. Auburn limited Georgia’s run game, which in turn results in long distances on second down.“It was a struggle because that’s what we mainly do,” redshirt freshman offensive lineman Solomon Kindley said.The Bulldogs haven’t been in these situations a ton this season. After all, they were undefeated before traveling to the Plains.But Auburn completely suffocated Georgia’s offensive attack, and it showed in the brief amounts of time the Bulldogs were on the field.“We’re 9-0 and what we’ve been doing has been working for nine games straight,” Kindley said. “Eventually, it stops this game, it’s like mind-blowing and shocking because we’ve been doing something consistent for nine games straight, and now we’ve got to do something else.”",Jed May | Senior Staff Writer,gameday,https://www.redandblack.com/gameday/georgia-s-offense-and-defense-both-affected-by-three-and/article_a66652e0-c74b-11e7-84e5-5fb9c1dec7e9.html
11-Nov-17,Georgia's run game stifled in loss to Auburn,"AUBURN, Ala. — Forty-six yards.That’s the total yards Georgia had on the ground in its 40-17 loss to Auburn on Saturday. But it wasn’t for lack of trying. Between running backs Nick Chubb, Sony Michel and D’Andre Swift, Georgia had 24 carries.A lot of it came down to the offensive line, which coming into the game against Auburn, seemed to have answered all the questions people had about it before the season started. But on Saturday, those questions crept back up.


 


“They just had a very good scheme,” redshirt freshman right guard Solomon Kindley said. “And I guess they just loaded the box on us.”In a loud environment, when the Bulldogs were trailing against what Kindley said was probably the best defense Georgia has gone up against this season, the offensive line struggled to create any room for Chubb, Michel and Swift to run.“If you lose the line of scrimmage on both sides of the ball, you don't have a great chance of a good outcome,” head coach Kirby Smart said.On top of the difficulties Georgia had running the ball, it didn’t give freshman quarterback Jake Fromm any time to throw the ball downfield either. At some points, he had to drop back about 15 yards just to give himself time to throw downfield.Still, that didn’t help too much as he was only able to connect on 13 of his 29 attempts for the night. He was only 7-for-17 through the third quarter, though.“They were more physical than us up front this game,” Smart said. “It is what it is.”Fromm simply didn’t have time to make any decisions when he was in the pocket. He was forced out, had to scramble once and took a few sacks. That, coupled with the backs not having anywhere to run gave Auburn plenty of opportunity to take advantage of the Bulldogs’ young offensive line.“I guess every team has that game one time,” Kindley said. “And I guess it was our game.”

12-Nov-17,Freshmen players contribute heavily to Georgia women’s basketball’s win over Wofford,"In her first game as a Bulldog, Georgia women’s basketball freshman Que Morrison made history.Morrison led the team with 19 points in Georgia’s 95-56 win over Wofford on Sunday. Her 19 points were the most scored by a Georgia freshman in a season opener since Tasha Humphrey scored 25 in Georgia’s opening game in 2005.“As a point guard, my job is to get [Morrison] the ball when she’s on, so I was just focusing on driving and kicking,” redshirt sophomore Taja Cole said. “She has confidence in her shot, and I’m going to keep passing it if she’s going to keep knocking it down.”


 


Morrison was one of three Georgia freshmen who played in the Bulldogs’ season opener against Wofford.Along with Morrison, Gabby Connally and Maya Caldwell also saw significant playing time in the win.Connally finished with six points, two rebounds and four assists, while Caldwell tallied five points, three rebounds and two assists.Head coach Joni Taylor credited the success of the freshmen to the intensity of the training they participated in throughout the summer.“We have a really tough schedule all around, so we knew they needed to be seasoned,” Taylor said. “They’ve been pleasers since the day they stepped foot on campus. They want to please, they want to do whatever it is they can do to make the team better.”Morrison, who started the game for the Bulldogs, was among the team’s statistical leaders in the win. In addition to her 19 points, she also contributed six rebounds, two assists and two steals in the winning effort.Morrison said that the fast pace of the game surprised her at first, but that her ability to adjust quickly led to her success in the game.“Coach Joni was like, ‘You’ve got to sprint down on offense, you’ve got to sprint down on defense,’” Morrison said. “It’s just sprint, sprint, sprint. It took some time to get used to, but once I got the flow of everything, it was good.”


 


Although she adjusted quickly, Morrison said she remained nervous throughout her first game, even as she continued to add on points for the team.“I was very nervous. My hands were sweating a lot, and I kept wiping them on my teammates,” Morrison said. “I’m still a little nervous, only because I feel like we played very good, and I’m just so happy.”",Janey Murray | Staff Writer,sports,https://www.redandblack.com/sports/womens_basketball/freshmen-players-contribute-heavily-to-georgia-women-s-basketball-s/article_c67bbfd4-c7fa-11e7-847a-0bba8abd251e.html
13-Nov-17,OPINION: Token characters on TV shows perpetuate harmful stereotypes,"Editor's NoteThe Red & Black publishes opinions from a number of contributors and staff columnists. Their opinions do not reflect the opinions of the editorial staff. The editorial staff is in no way involved with the opinion pieces published with the exception of editorials. Editorials are written by the editorial board consisting of the opinion editor, managing editor and editor-in-chief. Editorials are clearly marked EDITORIAL at the beginning. This article is from contributor Anika Chaturvedi, a sophomore journalism major minoring in political science.Stereotypes are how people easily characterize one another, but the presence of strong stereotypes in television can perpetuate harmful ideas about people different than us.Television tropes can be persistent and tend to appear in comedies. Although they can range from distinctive personality traits to physical characteristics, a popular trope is the token minority character.


 


Token minority characters are an attempt to integrate some sort of minority into a more uniform main cast, and they are present even in the most progressive shows to appeal to a greater variety of viewers. However, a lot of these token characters regress into obvious stereotypes.“The Simpsons” is the longest-running primetime comedy and animated series in history, yet its portrayal of certain characters is less than ideal. Apu, convenience store owner and Ph.D. holder, speaks with a goofy, thick accent which makes for comedy gold, but can perpetuate false notions about an entire ethnicity.Another Indian character portrayed in a similar manner is Raj from “The Big Bang Theory,” who again speaks with a thick accent and holds a Ph.D. Raj is the only minority in the main cast of the show.While both Apu and Raj are loveable, they also are the butt of jokes based solely upon their race. Their impressive qualifications are overshadowed by these tropes.Typical token characters are also seen when one black person integrates into a cast of white characters, like Winston in “New Girl” or Angela in “Boy Meets World.” But sometimes this trope is flipped with one white person integrated into a cast of black characters, like Greg from “Everybody Hates Chris.”Great strides have been made in the last decade through programs on both legacy media and streaming platforms, like “How to Get Away with Murder,” “Fresh Off the Boat,” “Blackish,” and more. Many of these shows are written by minorities who are portrayed in the show, and these programs can act as a way to reclaim the portrayal of certain ethnicities.Ultimately, the focus should be on developing well-rounded and engaging characters instead of throwing in random minority characters to pander to audiences. Making these well-developed characters who happen to be minorities instead of creating underdeveloped characters just to fit a quota makes for a more entertaining experience overall.",Anika Chaturvedi | Contributor,opinion,https://www.redandblack.com/opinion/opinion-token-characters-on-tv-shows-perpetuate-harmful-stereotypes/article_2d2e361e-c7f4-11e7-9a96-5ff7b8bf9194.html
13-Nov-17,Javon Wims has emerged as a force in Georgia's receiving game,"Without senior wide receiver Javon Wims, some of Georgia’s wins would have been a lot closer, and its only loss might have been a lot worse.“He’s a problem for us when we’re guarding him during practice,” senior defensive back Aaron Davis said. “Javon has come a long way as far as improving all aspects of his game and you’re starting to see it on the field.”Wims came from Hinds Community College in Mississippi, and started in just three games at Georgia last season. He didn’t make much noise until the AutoZone Liberty Bowl, though, where he had his first receiving touchdown as a Bulldog.


 


Since then, Wims has become one of Georgia’s leading receivers with 27 receptions, the longest of which was at Auburn on Saturday, for 471 receiving yards and four touchdowns. But it’s not the number of yards he has or the amount of touchdowns he’s accounted for that has been most impressive this season.“He’s become a hands receiver, which is what you want,” head coach Kirby Smart said. “He does a good job in what we call 50/50 balls.”Wims averages 17.4 yards per reception and a lot of that has to do with freshman quarterback Jake Fromm’s trust in him. Each and every game, it seems like Fromm trusts him to make a contested catch.And Wims recognizes that.“It feels good for him to trust me like that and just throw the ball up there and just believe I’m going to make the play, even when I'm not looking sometimes,” Wims said.There are a few things Wims thinks has helped him become the receiver he is today.First, it’s his basketball skills. He’s been playing basketball since he was seven years old, so he says he treats those 50/50 balls like they’re rebounds or alley-oops.Then there’s the practice he gets with wide receiver coach James Coley. Coley makes sure the receivers get as much live-action practice with defensive backs covering them as possible. That helps the receivers get their timing down perfectly and become more in sync with the quarterbacks.Lastly, it’s the relationship Wims and Fromm have off the field. Put simply, they’re good friends. They do all the things typical college students do, except after classes and on the weekends, they’re playing football for Georgia.Every chance he gets, Wims makes sure to show his quarterback he’s appreciative of the trust he shows towards him on the field. Whenever they get together, Wims tries to cook something special for Fromm. Last time, it was seafood gumbo.But once they leave the kitchen and make their way back to the field, they’re both tuned into the game. And when asked what catch has been his favorite this season, Wims had an easy answer.“Whichever is the last one,” he said.",Layne Saliba | Senior Staff Writer,sports,https://www.redandblack.com/sports/football/javon-wims-has-emerged-as-a-force-in-georgia-s/article_0ec71bd6-c8a9-11e7-ab73-ab962ff55e9c.html
16-Nov-17,Fighting for a fair share: Newly formed union says UGA could do better by workers,"The University of Georgia is the largest employer in Athens-Clarke County where 38.1 percent of the its residents earn an income below the poverty rate, yet only 4.2 percent of the county’s residents are unemployed, according to a Sept. 2017 Bureau of Labor Statistics survey.For University of Georgia mathematics professor Joseph Fu, the numbers just don’t add up.“This university is participating in the commiseration of a huge swath of our neighbors,” Fu said. “If the university is participating in this labor exploitation, then it is the worst kind of lesson.”


 


This semester, Fu and several university employees, ranging from tenured professors to custodians, created United Campus Workers of Georgia (UCW-GA) to advocate for fair pay and better working conditions on campus.Currently, UCW-GA has nearly 60 members since the organization went public less than a month ago and is in the process of collecting their first set of monthly dues, Fu said.“This is not a university-sanctioned organization,” said Gregory Trevor, the executive director of UGA media and communications, when asked about the organization. “You would have to speak with the organizers.”Fu said the organization’s main purpose is to protect their members’ rights as university employees.“Ideally, the concept of this union is to help protect the rights of these employees that will form the backbone of this union and will lead on various issues,” he said.One of the main issues that convinced them of the need for the union was last year’s changes to the Fair Labor Standards Act(FLSA.) The policy changed how many staff at the university were paid.Over 3,000 university staff, from office workers to dining hall custodians, were transitioned over to bi-weekly pay, leading to many employees going a week during the holiday season without their much-needed paychecks.


 


“Why do people inflict injuries on others? Because they can. The injured parties lack power. Simple,” Fu said. “FLSA is an emblem of the kinds of injuries that I know are perpetrated everyday against vulnerable employees.”Paul Pollack, a union leader and a mathematics professor at UGA, said he wants more transparency and accountability from UGA.“[I want] more transparency, more listening to the workers, and not just the people with the ‘cushy’ jobs, but giving a voice to those who have traditionally not had a voice.""-Paul Pollack, professor at UGA“[I want] more transparency, more listening to the workers, and not just the people with the ‘cushy’ jobs, but giving a voice to those who have traditionally not had a voice,” Pollack said.Fu said his hope is to recruit more professors to represent and strengthen the union.

Caitlin Hose, a guard from Hazel Green, Al, signed with the basketball program, joining Donnetta Johnson and Kaila Hubbard.“Caitlin is a very bright young woman who has tremendous ability on the court,” Taylor said. “Our staff enjoyed getting to know her and her family throughout the recruiting process, and I am glad she chose to be a Lady Bulldog.”Hose is entering her senior season at Hazel Green High School and will be an eligible freshman for 2018-19 basketball season. She averaged 16.2 points, 6.5 rebounds and 5.6 assists to lead her team to the Class 6A state championship game in 2016.


 


“Caitlin knows what it takes to win,” Taylor said. “Her high school team has played for the state title as she became one of the top players in Alabama.

17-Nov-17,Georgia cross country's Sam Drop is honored following performance at NCAA South Regionals,"Georgia cross country’s Sam Drop has been named as the U.S. Track & Field and Cross Country Coaches Association South Regional Women’s Athlete of the Year.Drop was voted in following her dominant performance at the NCAA South Regionals this past week in Tuscaloosa where she won the women’s 6k event, finishing with a new personal best time of 19:40.9.The Durham, Connecticut, product is the first winner of the award for the Georgia women’s program since 2010 when Kristie Krueger received the distinction, also finishing first overall in her regional race.


 


This distinction is yet another milestone in a surely gratifying season for Drop. Drop's recognition by the USTFCCCA as the South Regional Women’s Athlete of the Year will now compliment her All-SEC First Team selection following a top-five finish at the SEC Championships, where the Lady Bulldogs took second place overall.Drop comes off a season in which she led her squad in meets twice. She has also been the Lady Bulldogs’ second-best finisher in the season’s other meets that Georgia sent their regular scorers to compete in.As mentioned, Drop led her team at the NCAA South Regional this past Friday, as well as the NCAA Pre-Nationals in Louisville back in October.Through strong performances from Drop as well as their other runners, the Bulldogs on the women's side advanced to the NCAA Championships for the first time since the 2012 season.

17-Nov-17,Georgia women's cross country prepares for NCAA championship meet,"Georgia women’s cross country is all set to lace-up and compete at the NCAA National Championship meet. The Lady Bulldogs will compete in the 6k event at 10:45 a.m. on Saturday, Nov. 18 at the University of Louisville’s E.P. Tom Sawyer State Park.Georgia is one of 31 teams who qualified during last week’s Regional round, where the Bulldogs took second place overall in the women’s event.This meet marks Georgia’s first appearance at the competition since 2013 when the Bulldog men qualified after finishing first in their region.


 


Now, the women’s team will return to a familiar race course. The Bulldogs ran at Louisville’s E.P. Tom Sawyer State Park back in October for the NCAA Pre-Nationals meet, where the women placed sixth overall.However, NCAA Nationals feature the best of the best. The race brings together the top programs from around the country and lines all of them up in one race against each other. Facing such a deep and tough field of competition can sometimes throw teams off of their race-plan, but Georgia head coach Patrick Cunniff knows what his team will need to do in order to compete at the level it is aspiring to on Saturday.""Our number one focus all year, regardless of the circumstance, regardless of the field, regardless of the course, has been to focus both as a team and individually on running our own best race and executing our race the way we want to,” Cunniff said. ""I think that pays off more at the NCAA National Championship meet than anywhere else. If we can stay with that, we’re going to have a great performance.”Sophomore runner Samantha Drop concurred, adding, ""I feel like all of us need to have a good day. One of us can’t slack off, we all need to have our best race in order to be competitive with everyone else.”Saturday’s meet is just another chapter in an exciting and perhaps surprising season for the Lady Bulldogs. While the women’s goal all along was to make it to Nationals, they perhaps all would not have confirmed that was a definite possibility going into the season.""The goal back in August was that we wanted to make Nationals,” Drop said. ""We kind of thought we could do it, but we were not sure.”Now, however, Georgia knows it belongs among the nation’s top programs, and is ready to go out and prove it.""Now we are stoked that we’re actually able to [compete at Nationals]. I’m just excited to be able to compete at a high level with the best runners in the nation,” Drop said.


 


Georgia’s return to NCAA Nationals also marks a gratifying achievement for Cunniff, an alumnus of the Bulldogs’ cross country program. While he does express pride that he can lead his alma mater back to the competition, Cunniff is quick to throw all of the accolades and appreciation to the individuals he feels deserve it most.""100 percent, this qualification and season is on this group of young ladies,” Cunniff said. ""It’s just a joy to see their hard work be rewarded. It’s awesome to see them continuously step up in every circumstance, and now they get to reward themselves by running in the best race in the land.”",Jack Austin | Contributor,sports,https://www.redandblack.com/sports/cross_country/georgia-women-s-cross-country-prepares-for-ncaa-championship-meet/article_01305d7e-cbe3-11e7-9864-43d07a239f6e.html
18-Nov-17,Delta Sigma Phi crowns Miss Sorority Row 2017,"Though kick-off isn’t until 3:30 p.m. today, some sorority women got into their gameday gear a little early during the Miss Sorority Row philanthropy event hosted by Delta Sigma Phi fraternity on Friday night.Fourteen women participated, each from different sororities, and were judged by a panel of five judges on their gameday wear, formal wear, talent and responses to a question and answer section.“I was very nervous when they asked me to do the event,” emcee Matt Chrzanowski said. “It combines two of my biggest fears — public speaking and girls.”


 


The emcees, Chrzanowski and 2016 Miss Sorority Row Megan Moroney, took the stage around 7:20 p.m., and each contestant introduced themselves wearing their formal wear.At 9:30 p.m., Chrzanowski announced the runner ups, and Moroney crowned Delta Delta Delta’s Karson Pennington, a sophomore political science and journalism major from Augusta. Introducing Karson Pennington, our contestant from Delta Delta Delta!A post shared by Miss Sorority Row (@misssororityrow) on Nov 12, 2017 at 8:40am PST“Because this is ESP, it’s just really special, so having won something like this that goes toward something that benefits so many people, it just means the world to me to give back in this way,” Pennington said. “Even if I hadn’t won, I would still be this happy right now.Talents included everything from a spoof of the Napoleon Dynamite dance scene, hula-hooping, a song represented in sign language and an “Ode to Frat Boys” rap.President of Delta Sigma Phi Austin Hibbard said Miss Sorority Row is a national philanthropy event for the fraternity and has been going on for more than 10 years at the University of Georgia.


 


“The fraternity version of Mr. Milledge is our event,” Hibbard said. “It really depends on the sorority if they go all into it or not. I wouldn’t say we’re as big as Mr. Milledge, but we’re definitely comparable.”The women could also earn points based on the amount of sorority members who come to cheer on their sisters.Before counting the ticket sales at the door, Hibbard said the fraternity already raised $23,000 for Extra Special People, an organization that “provides opportunities for individuals with disabilities and their families to engage, connect and thrive,” according to their website.Courtney Lee, a junior pre-occupational therapy major from Buford, said she came to the pageant as a member of ESP.“I’m most looking forward to seeing my buddy Rod being up on stage and escorting because he’s very outgoing and loves this stuff,” Lee said.Two members of ESP are included in the judging panel and others are cheering on the women from the audience or escorting them on stage.Between gameday wear and talent, the emcees invited ESP members to show off their own talents, which included beatboxing and singing.Lee said this is a NKA event -- or No Kids Allowed -- and is geared toward the older members of the organization.

The event took place in Tate Grand Hall, and while the fraternity wanted to fill up the room, around half the seats were taken. Last year, Hibbard said, around 750 people turned out, and the event raised around $13,000, which was a drop from their usual amount raised.Along with selling $15 tickets, the fraternity hosted percentage nights, accepted sponsorship and donations and encouraged individual fundraising with the fraternity brothers.“Every single dollar donated is going to ESP, and our fraternity chapter is covering the fees for the event space and everything else,” said Kyle Shumeyko, Delta Sigma Phi’s philanthropy chair.It’s the fraternity’s biggest fundraising event, and Shumeyko said communication was key for everything to run smoothly.Hibbard said former philanthropy chairs have passed down how to organize the event efficiently, and this year the only change was the venue from the Classic Center and into Tate Grand Hall.“Communication is the biggest thing, linking between Tate and the sororities and ESP,” said Shumeyko.Lee, who is a member of Alpha Gamma Delta, said women can either get nominated or nominate themselves to represent the sorority.Pennington said she participated because of her sorority’s nomination.

“I decided to do it because I got nominated, and I just didn’t want to let them down,” Pennington said. “It is for such a good cause -- I would do anything for ESP.”",Erin Schilling | City News Editor,uganews,https://www.redandblack.com/uganews/delta-sigma-phi-crowns-miss-sorority-row/article_71f386c0-cc25-11e7-91b5-6b70db7e138e.html

25-Nov-17,Special performance: Georgia’s special teams serve as an advantage in win over Georgia Tech,"When Georgia head coach Kirby Smart was asked in his post-game press conference what he thought the most improved aspects of his team are this season, he immediately answered ‘special teams.’On Saturday, the unit certainly lived up to that appraisal as it served a pivotal role in Georgia beating Georgia Tech 38-7.Georgia Tech’s offense, which came into the matchup the No. 4 rushing offense in the country, only started beyond its own 25-yard line once, and that was only because a personal foul on Georgia pushed the ball 15 yards forward to the Georgia Tech 27.


 


On the other side, Georgia started four of its nine drives, including three of its four first half drives, from the 30-yard line or beyond. Each of those drives resulted in a score for Georgia.A season ago, special teams were a bane for the Bulldogs, but the team has improved this season in kickoff returns, kickoff return defense and punt return defense. Georgia wide receiver Mecole Hardman entered Saturday’s game the No. 1 kick returner in the SEC.“I think [the special teams are] playing at a higher rate,” Smart said.All of this is a result of the emphasis the coaching staff has placed on special teams, linebacker Natrez Patrick said.“Coach [Smart] always preaches that we need to have an edge on special teams, and we push that really hard in practice,” Patrick said.The special teams advantage proved to be especially advantageous for Georgia in the first half, when the Yellow Jackets racked up 123 rushing yards and converted 70 percent of third downs. As a result of poor field position, Georgia Tech had at least 75 yards to go to reach the end zone on each of its first half drives.This gave the Georgia defense more opportunities to stop the Yellow Jackets, who only had seven points to show for their first half efforts.“We emphasize on special teams because it can give you the edge,” Patrick said.

26-Nov-17,Win over BYU keeps Georgia women's basketball undefeated,"At the 7:14 mark in the fourth quarter, Georgia forward Caliya Robinson hit a three pointer to give the Bulldogs a 12-point lead. The three pointer came at a crucial moment for the Bulldogs as BYU was mounting a comeback.The Georgia (5-0) women’s basketball team defeated BYU (3-2) 79-63 on Saturday night. Mackenzie Engram, Taja Cole, Que Morrison and Robinson all scored in double digit figures. The Bulldogs defense was key as they were able to force BYU into taking bad shots and attempting bad passes.“Mackenzie and Caliya provided a huge lift for us with several big 3-pointers that got the rest of our team going,” head coach Joni Taylor said. “We knew we were going to get BYU’s best shot and credit them for coming back in the second half. BYU is a good team and we are proud to head back to Georgia with a win.”


 


The first three minutes of the game, saw both teams struggle to make anything. BYU was able to score the first basket. As soon as the deadlock was broken, Georgia went on a 9-0 run. At that point, Georgia’s defense was imposing its will on BYU. However, the Cougars ended the quarter on a 10-2 run, but Georgia took a 13-12 lead to the second quarter.The second quarter, saw Georgia execute its offense and defense to perfection. The Bulldogs went on a 21-2 run during the 9:33 to 2:11 mark. During that run, Georgia forced four steals, and two of them led to transition threes for the Bulldogs. Robinson caught fire in the second quarter scoring 11 of her 21 points in the second quarter. Georgia took a 36-22 lead into the half.At one point, the Bulldogs held a 22-point lead, but at the 2:52 mark BYU started to mount a comeback. The Cougars began to high press Georgia, and began to feed the ball to forward Sara Hamson.

27-Nov-17,"Revenge, redo, rematch: Georgia gets another shot at Auburn in the SEC championship","Take your pick from a handful of words starting with the prefix ""re"" and that’s what it seems like Bulldogs are doing this weekend.As the SEC championship game between Georgia and Auburn approaches, those words continue to slip into conversations and questions. There’s a chance for revenge after Georgia lost to this team a few weeks ago, but the players aren’t calling it that. And the matchup could even serve as a redo of sorts after mistakes and penalties plagued the Bulldogs in the initial matchup, but that’s not something the team was necessarily seeking. To them, the game is simply a rematch.With Georgia’s only blemish on its season record coming at the hands of Auburn, the game between these two teams will be replayed, this time inside Atlanta’s new Mercedes-Benz Stadium for a conference title.


 


When Georgia and Auburn played on Nov. 11, the Tigers trounced the Bulldogs, winning 40-17. Georgia accumulated multiple costly penalties and had a few key mistakes. The run game couldn’t push past Auburn’s defensive front, while Georgia’s defense couldn’t stop Auburn’s backs.From the final statistics to the end result, Georgia’s play against Auburn was unlike the other 11 games so far this season.And even though he wasn’t explicitly hoping for a redo after the regular-season matchup, now, running back Sony Michel said, the team has “another shot.”“The last game that we played against them, that wasn't us,” wide receiver Terry Godwin said. “We knew we made a lot of mistakes and didn't perform the way we wanted to perform. I feel like we've got a chance to redeem ourselves. That's what we're going to go out there and do.”In a way, Godwin said, the loss turned into a “chip on our shoulder” and was almost like a wake-up call.Prior to the defeat at Jordan-Hare Stadium, Georgia was the No. 1 team in the country and there had been murmurs of the Bulldogs reaching the College Football Playoff regardless of whether or not they won the conference title game.Now, multiple teams, such as Georgia, Auburn, Miami, Clemson and Wisconsin, have found themselves at the end of the regular season with a shot to make the playoff, given one simple-sounding condition: win this Saturday.“I just know for sure that [Georgia is] going to bring it,” Auburn linebacker Tre’ Williams said. “No matter what, they're going to bring their A game, so we're going to have to prepare like we've never played them because Georgia is a really good team.”Even after the mistake-riddled loss at Auburn earlier in the month, Godwin doesn’t see the SEC championship as a chance for revenge, and neither does Lorenzo Carter. Looking at the game that way would just consume “emotional energy,” Carter said.Plus, head coach Kirby Smart, who has experience with this type rematch since Alabama beat LSU for the national title in 2011, said simply having a revenge-oriented mindset can’t single-handedly win a game.“When the toe meets leather, it’s about striking people, it’s about speed, it’s about blocking, tackling, it’s about having composure, it’s about having discipline,” head coach Kirby Smart said. “It really doesn’t revert back to who won the previous game. It matters a lot more about what you do in that game because the other game is past history.”And on Saturday, what Georgia does in that game on that day will have playoff-sized implications. Everything else will simply be part of the past.",Emily Giambalvo | Senior Staff Writer,sports,https://www.redandblack.com/sports/football/revenge-redo-rematch-georgia-gets-another-shot-at-auburn-in/article_e3d46b46-d3b5-11e7-b8c5-3f6ae5f4b8e0.html
27-Nov-17,Georgia women's basketball finds offensive spark from bench players,"At the 5:38 mark in the first quarter, the Georgia women’s basketball team was trailing Tennessee Tech 9-2, and redshirt sophomore Taja Cole had committed three turnovers. Head coach Joni Taylor decided to take out Cole and put in Gabby Connally. She instantly provided some life to the Georgia offense.Throughout the game, Taylor continued to look toward her bench for answers.Georgia’s (5-0) bench outscored the Golden Eagles (1-4) bench 29-10, the


 


substitutes were the reason the Bulldogs were able to secure a 56-48 win.Stephanie Paul, Maya Caldwell and Connally combined to score 27 points. All three hit crucial baskets late in the game to extend Georgia’s lead.Caldwell, who scored a career-high 12 points, said her performance came down to knowing her role on the team.Taylor said Caldwell’s showing tonight was a result of her focusing and executing the offense and defense.The players off the bench helped bail out the starters who were struggling to create and score points.Mackenzie Engram, who scored five points, was upset about her performance, but she was quick to praise the bench players.“Being able to have a deep bench that allows them to come in and perform they way they did I think it's really good for us,” Engram said. “As starters, we definitely have to be more in tuned with our shot because once we get down the [schedule] everyone is going to have to contribute.”Taylor was frustrated that the team didn’t come out focused. She felt it caused a lot of the problems they had on offense. However, she was glad that her bench stepped up and provided quality minutes.


 


“I thought our bench played well,” Taylor said. “Stephanie came in and gave us some good minutes and when Bianca was in she did as well. They carried us until some of our starters could come in and pick it up in the third and fourth quarter.”",Yash Bhika | Staff Writer,sports,https://www.redandblack.com/sports/womens_basketball/georgia-women-s-basketball-finds-offensive-spark-from-bench-players/article_56bf6e02-d3e9-11e7-82cf-67692b3e8465.html

28-Nov-17,Let's get physical: Kirby Smart emphasizing physicality in practice before rematch against Auburn,"When Georgia head coach Kirby Smart was asked on Nov. 28 what the biggest key to producing a different result against Auburn in the second matchup between the teams than the first — a 40-17 loss on the road for the Bulldogs— his answer was short and to the point.“Physicality,” Smart said.Playing physical on both sides of the ball will be a major key for the Bulldogs when they take on the Tigers this Saturday for the second time this year.


 


Defensive lineman David Marshall said it’s important to avoid shying away from contact when going up against a talented running back like Kerryon Johnson, who is a physical player himself. Much like Smart, Marshall did not need many words to get his point across.“They’re a run offense, so we’ve got to stop them,” he said.Fellow defensive player Reggie Carter was in agreement, adding that the team needs “to have a more physical week of practice” if it wants to be fully prepared to take on the Auburn offense that put up nearly 500 yards on the Bulldogs just a few weeks ago.And while most may picture a battle between goliath-like defensive players such as the 274-pound Marshall and equally big or larger offensive linemen when it comes to physical battles in football games, there’s a third facet of the sport in which seeking out contact is just as important.Punter Cameron Nizialek said it’s just as key in the punt game, although maybe not in his specific case.“Not necessarily me being more physical, but I think the guys on the front line that are going down and covering striking and blocks and getting down the field and making plays, I think that’s something that we always emphasize, and this week especially, playing Auburn,” Nizialek said. “They’re a really physical team, and that’s something that we’re going to keep doing this week.”Nizialek did say he would offer his skills as a tackler up if he needs to — he believes he’s made about two tackles in his entire football career — but he’s hoping it doesn’t come to that.And whether it’s a run, a pass or even a punt, Smart said the Georgia players need to bring the same level of physicality to the field on every snap. Because if the Bulldogs play with the level of intensity Smart saw from them in the first contest between his squad and Auburn, he doesn’t expect the result to be any different the second time around.“Physicality is an attitude … it’s an attitude with which you approach the game and how you approach contact,” Smart said. “And we didn’t do as good a job as they did at that.”",Nathan Berg | Assistant Sports Editor,sports,https://www.redandblack.com/sports/football/let-s-get-physical-kirby-smart-emphasizing-physicality-in-practice/article_78f2d712-d4a1-11e7-8803-172a45644a94.html
29-Nov-17,Tiger’s den to Mercedes-Benz: Georgia offense looking forward to less hostile environment in Atlanta,"Jeb Blazevich said he is not sure exactly how many Auburn fans were present at Jordan-Hare Stadium when Georgia played there on Nov. 11. What the Georgia tight end does remember is the sight he took in when he was on the stadium’s field on earlier in November.“It was an awesome environment,” Blazevich said. “I mean, going in there, you see the student section rocking.”The capacity of Jordan-Hare Stadium, for the record, is 85,451. While not all of those present on Nov. 11, when the Tigers thrashed Georgia 40-17, were Auburn fans, the home team enjoyed a home field advantage, creating what tight end Isaac Nauta said was the “craziest” environment he has ever played in.


 


When Georgia and Auburn rematch on Saturday in the SEC Championship, it will be outside of Auburn’s own backyard and inside Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta, giving Georgia’s offense one less issue to contend with.The Bulldogs played in several away venues this season, including Notre Dame, Tennessee and Georgia Tech. While traveling Georgia fans diluted the Irish crowd at Notre Dame Stadium, Nauta said the team’s other away environments were not as electric as Auburn’s for another reason.“Everybody else, we jumped on pretty early, so we were able to take the crowd out of it,” Nauta said.While Georgia did take an early 7-0 lead on Auburn the first time the two teams played, the early success didn’t last and the tide quickly turned against the Bulldogs, who were outscored 16-0 after that first touchdown.When Georgia and Auburn face off in the SEC Championship on Saturday, however, an entirely different type of crowd will be in the stands. The game is a neutral site, and huge numbers of fans from each team are expected to be in attendance.The lack of an overwhelming home field advantage for the Tigers will make life easier for the Bulldogs this time around, Nauta said.“Once a team gets rolling at home, the crowd gets into it,” Nauta said. “That’s always hard to battle against.”Not only will there be less noise when the offense is on the field, making it more difficult for players to hear play calls and snap counts, but the opposing defense will not be able to feed off the energy a home crowd provides, offensive lineman Isaiah Wynn said.All of those issues will likely be diminished for Georgia’s offense on Saturday, with neither team able to claim a true home advantage.“We’re playing in a dome, and it’s going to be half-and-half, so it’s going to be a great atmosphere for both of us,” Nauta said.",Alex Soderstrom | Senior Staff Writer,sports,https://www.redandblack.com/sports/football/tiger-s-den-to-mercedes-benz-georgia-offense-looking-forward/article_3565c516-d56b-11e7-a9e6-eb02bb007db0.html

30-Nov-17,Georgia volleyball moves past UCF in straight sets at NIVC tournament,"The Georgia volleyball team will be moving on to the next round of the National Invitational Volleyball Championship (NIVC) tournament after beating UCF in straight sets on Wednesday (25-17, 25-21, 25-17).It was a symmetrical match for Georgia (22-18, 10-8 SEC) as far as the score is concerned, with two comfortable eight-point wins surrounding the dramatic second set. While the Bulldogs only trailed twice in the entire match, their lead was repeatedly put to the test by a UCF team that refused to quit.Every time the Knights (20-14, 12-8 American Athletic Conference) threatened, the Bulldogs responded.


 


“It’s good to see us getting better,” said head coach Tom Black. “I thought our blocking got better and we had some really nice serving runs down the stretch.”After handling the Knights in the opening set, Georgia struggled to gain separation in the second. After UCF scored two straight points to tie the game at 9-9, the Bulldogs went on an 11-4 run to claim a 19-13 lead.After a few challenges from UCF, a timeout from UCF, and a stoppage of play as the head referee determined the outcome of a play, Georgia eventually found itself right back in a closely-contested match. The Knights scored five unanswered points following their timeout to bring the score to 19-18.According to senior Kendall Kazor, these delays were no disruption for the experienced Bulldog team.“I think in the beginning of the season, yeah it would be distracting. But by now I think we’ve become accustomed to it,” she said. “We move through it pretty fast and start talking about the other team and the gameplay.”Following a Bulldog timeout, a kill from Kazor ignited the Bulldogs on a 6-3 run to close out the set.In the final set, Georgia never trailed. The Knights scored four unanswered points to bring the score to 18-12, however Georgia was not fazed and ended the match with two emphatic kills.“In that third set, our defenders were really aggressive and our blockers were getting over fast, and that’s our game. What we’re focused on now is can we do that point one, set one?” Kazor said.


 


Freshman T’ara Ceasar led all Bulldogs with 16 kills, and fellow freshman Kendall Glover recorded a team-best 19 digs. Ceasar also had a career-best hitting percentage of .520 in what was Georgia’s 17th straight-set victory of the season.",Tommy Boyd | Staff Writer,sports,https://www.redandblack.com/sports/volleyball/georgia-volleyball-moves-past-ucf-in-straight-sets-at-nivc/article_e106e1ee-d5d8-11e7-9194-9bfd36e2fb5a.html
30-Nov-17,Growing up tough: Terry Godwin was faced with difficult life choices before coming to Georgia,"There’s a house on Valley Street in LaGrange, Georgia. It’s where Terry Godwin spent his early years. And just near that short, dead-end street is a field where Godwin used to go to play all sorts of games, but mostly football, with the older kids in his neighborhood. It’s sort of where it all started for him.It didn’t have to be that way, though. It could have happened on an actual field with kids his age, but Godwin never really liked the altered rules of little league sports. He could hit a baseball to the outfield when he was young. He was just five years old, and his parents, Olivia and Terry Sr., signed him up to play T-ball since he’d grown up around the sport. His uncles, Aundra Trammell and Jerry Godwin, played baseball, so Godwin naturally wanted to get in on the action to follow in their footsteps.


 


“He went to run the bases and they told him he only could go to one base,” Godwin’s mom said. “He said ‘I don't want to play this anymore' because he thought it was going to actually be like real baseball.”

The same thing happened with football. Godwin only wanted to tackle. So when he was told he had to pull a flag from his opponent's waist, he didn’t want to play that either. He simply had to wait until the rules caught up.Growing up on Valley Street, Godwin was always the tough kid. He had to be.He didn’t have any brothers. It was just him and his two older sisters, Keyatta and Terryuana, until his younger sister, Tyterria, came along.“I mean, he wanted motorcycles and we had given him all that,” Godwin's mother said. “And he was just rough with it.”Since then, Godwin’s life has been all about proving he’s tough and making tough decisions.Lil’ T goes to CallawayGrowing up in LaGrange was fun for Godwin and his family. His mom and dad went to and graduated from LaGrange High School. That’s where his older sisters went too.He played for the Monarchs, a travel baseball team in LaGrange.

The team was specifically started for him and his friends by Broderick Stargell, who was like Godwin’s second father. He saw something special in Godwin and his group of friends.“I just wanted to be a part of what they had going,” said Stargell, who still stays in touch with Godwin to this day. “So in order for me to keep my hands on them, I had to kind of dangle baseball out in front of them to kind of grab their attention.”Travel baseball isn’t cheap, though. But Stargell was so serious about keeping this group on the right track and making sure it had a bright future that he started a trucking company just to fund the baseball team.That trucking company, Allstar Transport, was around for about five years, which was just enough time to get that group of kids through travel baseball.“He would come by in his little Honda, away from his family, and pick Terry up every day while I was working or his father was working and take him to baseball practice,” Godwin’s mom said. “And Terry loved it.”All of that was good, but eventually, the Godwins needed a bigger home, something nicer to live in because their home in LaGrange just wasn’t working anymore. So, they found a house in Hogansville, Georgia, just a little over 10 miles from LaGrange.Also, just out of the LaGrange High School district.“I really didn't want to leave my friends or anything like that and transfer schools and try to get to know people,” Godwin said. “Because, I mean, as a young kid, that's kind of hard.”Hogansville is a much smaller town than LaGrange, and the transition was difficult for Godwin. He couldn’t just walk to his friends’ houses anymore or walk out his own front door and meet up with other kids to play football across the street. But the change was necessary.Their house in LaGrange was built in the 1920s. It was old and needed work. So after looking around for homes, the Godwins found one the right size in Hogansville for a good price.Even though Godwin struggled at first, he grew to like Hogansville and eventually Callaway High School, so much so that when his mother offered to move him back to LaGrange, he said no.“I made a brotherhood with some of the guys that were in middle school,” Godwin said “We went in high school together and, I mean, just being able to connect with people like that, it will take you a long way.”

And it did take him a long way. The relationships carried him through three sports at Callaway. He played football, baseball and basketball, all of which he excelled at. But the two that were at the forefront were football and baseball.“He always brought a positive attitude on the field,” said Pete Wiggins, Godwin’s high school football coach. “At practice he was a leader, in good times and bad. He is a positive guy that works his butt off and that's why he is where he is.”Godwin was being recruited by top football programs like Alabama and Auburn, on top of Georgia, while being recruited by Major League Baseball teams as well. He actually took part in some workouts with the Atlanta Braves and Texas Rangers.As he made his way through high school, especially throughout his senior year, there was a lot of pressure on the thought of what his future would look like.And the truth is, he didn’t know what it would look like. That was one of the tough decisions he had to make. And it was only made tougher around the time he was set to commit to play football at Georgia.Father and sonGodwin and his father had a unique relationship from the very beginning.Godwin’s father did not have the closest relationship with his own father, so he decided he wasn’t going to be that way when he had kids.“I just had my mother,” Godwin’s father said. “And I always had in my head that I wasn't going to leave my kids. I was going to make them have everything they wanted.”So that’s what he did. The only downside to that was it took him away from his children quite a bit, especially after Godwin’s mother became a stay-at-home mom when she injured her back at work and couldn’t work anymore. Godwin’s father had to work even more hours, and eventually ended up working two jobs.Godwin quickly became a momma’s boy since he spent so much time with her and his sisters, but that didn’t mean he and his father weren’t still connected.

“Him and his dad have a bond that's really, really close,” Godwin’s mother said. “Because when he's there, it's about them two only, because he's trying to catch up and build that father and son relationship.”Godwin’s father only wanted to see his son succeed. So when his son was doing so well in baseball and football, Godwin’s father couldn’t have been more thrilled.But on Jan. 5, 2014, the thrill was suddenly subdued when Godwin’s father got a strange feeling while at work. He wasn’t feeling well, so he went to the hospital. After running some tests, doctors found that he had colon cancer.This was just weeks before Godwin was set to make his college commitment to Georgia, and it caused a lot of confusion in the family’s life.“Football and all that was really out of the picture in my mind,” Godwin said. “I was so focused on him, making sure he was good. And he told me to keep doing what I was doing, making him proud and I told him as long as I was making him proud I was going to do what he wanted me to do.”The main thing Godwin’s father wanted his son to do was to not choose something simply based off the fact that he was sick. And that was hard for Godwin.During the early part of his father’s colon cancer, Godwin was faced with two options.

He could stay committed to Georgia and play football or he could sign with a MLB team, which would come with an immediate signing bonus. It’s something he seriously considered and struggled with while he was going through the recruiting process.In reality, Georgia almost missed out on one of its best wide receiver recruits because Godwin wanted to provide for his family while prioritizing his father’s health.He eventually decided to stay with Georgia, though, and enroll in summer classes once he graduated from Callaway.But that didn’t stop the Atlanta Braves from calling.“I came up to Georgia on June 1 and I was in my dorm and my mom called me and said they drafted me,” Godwin said. “And to this day, I still never gave the Braves an answer. I didn't call them back or give them a yes or no or anything.”It wasn’t a decision Godwin took lightly. He said he sat in his room and had to think about it and pray about it a lot. In the end, he had to be reminded that even though the money from a MLB team could have helped the family financially with the things his father needed, he had to make the decision that was best for him.“I just had to let him know that we were going to be OK,” Godwin’s mother said.Godwin’s wideout coach and mentor at Callaway, Kareem Douhne, understood what his player was going through. His wife, Amanda, was the oncology pharmacist at WellStar of LaGrange, formerly West Georgia Healthcare, where Godwin’s father was treated.“I’m sure he broke down a couple of times, but I didn’t really see that,” he said. “I could see it in his eyes that he was hurting a little bit and worried about his dad, but it was almost like playing a sport. He wasn't going to let that defeat him and he was going to push and push and be positive for his family and his dad. And I think his dad fed off that.”“That’s just him being him”Godwin is a junior at Georgia now and has become a big part of the Bulldogs’ receiving game.He’s second on the team with 24 receptions for 492 yards and five touchdowns, just one touchdown behind the team leader, Javon Wims.And he’s stood out quite a few times this season, too. Against Mississippi State, Godwin caught a flea-flicker pass from Jake Fromm for a touchdown. Against Notre Dame, Godwin caught a pass, one-handed, near the sideline of the end zone that was SportCenter’s top play for the night.But for the people that know him best, those types of plays aren't out of the ordinary for Godwin.

“I don’t even get excited anymore because that’s just him being him,” said Tez Parks, Godwin’s former teammate at Callaway and current running back at Southern Miss. “I’ve been watching him do stuff like this for years and years.”While Godwin’s freshman season went by without any problems, he struggled during his sophomore year.“That second year, I think it kind of hit,” Godwin’s mother said. “We had to really pray a lot because I think it took a toll on him.”She didn’t know what it was that bothered him. It might have been the coaching change, it might have been the stress of playing a bigger role in games or even just the adjustment of college.He made it through that, though, just like he made it through transferring schools at a young age, dealing with his father’s cancer diagnosis and the choice of whether or not to pursue professional baseball or not.Godwin has made it through all of those tough situations and he has his family, especially his father, to thank.“Even though I didn’t get to see him a lot as a little kid, I still knew that he was there,” Godwin said of his father. “I knew that he cared and stuff like that. He made me the man I am today and I’m trying to follow in his footsteps.”

30-Nov-17,Tyree Crump finally finds his range in strong performance against Saint Mary’s,"In the first five games of his sophomore campaign, Georgia guard Tyree Crump had struggled to hit his stride.Not once did he score in double figures and had shot just 5-for-23 from 3-point range in the Bulldogs’ first five contests, a lowly statistic for a talented shooter such as Crump.But on Sunday, in Georgia’s 83-81 overtime win over the No. 21-ranked Saint Mary’s Gaels, Crump finally found his touch.


 


He went scoreless in the first half of the game but came through for his team down the stretch, as all 17 of his points came in the second half and overtime. Crump knocked down four of his seven 3-point attempts en route to setting a new career high in scoring in just 21 minutes played.“I always tell myself that if I see one go in, I can make a couple more,” Crump said. “That’s what happened in the Saint Mary’s game. I saw one go in…The basket just got big to me and I was just able to find it.”Crump’s performance played a large role in, perhaps, the best offensive showing of the year for the Bulldogs.The team shot 50.8 percent from the field and 41.2 percent from beyond the arc while turning it over just nine times against the first ranked opponent of the year for the Bulldogs.And Crump’s ability to knock down shots from the outside proved crucial in a big game for a team that has posted dismal marks of 5-for-22 (against USC Upstate) and 5-for-21 (against Texas A&M-Corpus Christi) from 3-point range already this year.“[Better outside shooting] helped a lot because I wound up getting to play one-on-one a lot in the post for some of the game,” senior forward Yante Maten said. “And that doesn’t really happen too much [and it was] because they were being really effective on the perimeter.”Crump is still fairly young in the college game, having just over a season of experience at this level. Now, his coach feels that he is beginning to settle into his role with the team and can continue to be a reliable marksman from the Bulldogs from the outside.“We want him to shoot the ball, he is a very good shooter,” Fox said. “He started slowly. He hadn’t put very many in the basket in the first couple of games. He had the same problem a year ago. But finally, he got a couple to go down. He was able to relax. I don’t know if his confidence has ever been shaken…I just think now that he is relaxed and he believes in his stroke.”


 


For Crump, himself, his performance against Saint Mary’s was one that just helped take some weight off of his shoulders that had built up after some lackluster performances to start the year.But now, he feels that he is ready to hit the ground running and find some consistency in his perimeter game.“I’ve just been struggling but I believe that [improvement] is coming,” Crump said. “I had to have a game like Saint Mary’s.”",Collin Huguley | Staff Writer,sports,https://www.redandblack.com/sports/mens_basketball/tyree-crump-finally-finds-his-range-in-strong-performance-against/article_d27c4edc-d611-11e7-a86d-6ff95f0053f3.html
30-Nov-17,"Q&A;: Ray Wylie Hubbard talks musical influences, new record ahead of show in Athens","Legendary Americana singer-songwriter Ray Wylie Hubbard is no stranger to the Athens music scene. The Texas-based musician said he plays in Athens at least once a year. On Friday, Dec. 1, Hubbard will headline the Georgia Theatre, playing songs from his newest record, “Tell the Devil I’m Getting There as Fast as I Can.” Hubbard talked with The Red & Black about his musical influences, growing his fan base and his new record.The Red & Black: How did you get into playing music?Ray Wylie Hubbard: It was in high school, back in the folk music craze. There was a fella in high school by the name of Michael Murphy who played at an assembly. He came out and said, “Here’s a song I wrote.” It was one of those moments. I got a guitar and learned some folk songs. After high school I went up to New Mexico and just traveled around with a guitar and a sleeping bag, doing the troubadour thing, and then stuck with it.


 


R&B: Who are your biggest musical influences?RWH: I started off in folk music, where the lyrics were really important. I had a good fortune to see such songwriters as Townes Van Zandt and Guy Clark. I was also able to see guys like Lightnin’ Hopkins and Mance Lipscomb and John Lee Hooker, the blues guys. In my 40s, it was a marriage of the lyrics, which have more depth and weight and humor to them, laid on a deep groove. That’s where I am today as an old cat, putting lyrics that come from that foundation and the lyrics of folk music. It’s working for me.R&B: Do you feel your genre is still folk music, or is it something else?RWH: The term they use now is ‘Americana’, which is a very broad palette that includes blues, folk, alt-country, bluegrass. That’s the term I feel comfortable with.R&B: What was one of the biggest challenges you faced throughout your career?RWH: I think, for me, I feel very fortunate that I have the freedom to write whatever I want to write about. I’m not writing songs for a publishing company, where I have to give some publishing company in Nashville 12 songs a year, to try and get someone to record them. My songwriting is not so much livelihood as it is lifestyle. Having the freedom of not being in a box, I can write some really cool songs.R&B: How did you develop and grow your fan base over the years?RWH: I suppose I keep at it. It’s kind of one of those things, I guess because of satellite radio, and local stations like NPR and public radio stations, and college radio stations. And of course the web, with Facebook and Twitter and social media, all that. People are finding me because I’m not on mainstream radio. I think people are searching out for something that’s not so homogenized. Maybe the audience is looking for something with a little more grit and groove, that’s got a depth and weight to it.


 


R&B: What are the biggest inspirations behind your new LP “Tell the Devil I’m Getting There as Fast as I Can?”RWH: It’s a metaphor for I’m getting old and time’s running out, it’s a prophecy. It’s kind of a rock and roll fable, the whole idea of the musician with an amp, guitar and a van, going to play in a funky club and falling in love with a woman who can cuss great and got some cool ink on her from Tulsa. That was kind of the center point of the album, that idea. Of course, having Eric Church and Lucinda Williams sing on it was quite a thrill. It solidifies it in that rock and roll fable that it is.R&B: Why did you decide to collaborate with artists like Eric Church, Lucinda Williams and The Bright Light Social Hour?RWH: Bright Light Social Hour is so cool, they’re a psychedelic rock band here in Austin. Their song, “The Rebellious Sons,” was a Hendrix, Black Angels-type vibe. I just ran into those guys. I called them up and said “Would y’all come in on this song?” They took me to a place I’ve never been before, with synthesizers and that whole psychedelic-rock-band thing. I feel very fortunate to have people that I really respect and admire on my record.R&B: How long have you been touring this album and where have you been performing with it?RWH: It’s been out about three months and we’ve been all over. From the West Coast, California, to Florida, to New York, to the Midwest. We’re still, they say, “working the record.” Coming to Athens, we haven’t been there since the record came out. This is a good opportunity to come there and perform new songs, plus the old songs that the audience demands I play.R&B: What do you like to do when you’re not touring?


TNCMS.AdManager.render({region: 'fixed-big-ad-bottom-asset', slot: 1, fold: ""below""});


RWH: My wife and I have an old log cabin here, south of Austin. When we got it, it was abandoned, and for the last 20 years we’ve been rebuilding it. That’s what I do in my down time. I’m fixing up this place. We’ve got it pretty well together, but there’s still always something to do.R&B: How many times have you played in Athens before?RWH: In the last seven, eight years, at least once a year. It has such a great foundation in music. It has the same status as Austin or New York as far as having that quality of music coming out of that town.R&B: Can you describe what your live show will be like?RWH: Well, I would hope they’d be entertained to an inch of their life. I think they’ll enjoy it and hopefully sing along. In Athens, because it has such a musical history, it’s like the audience becomes another member of the band. We’re all working for the same goal. There are moments in time that we’re together that we really enjoy it. Performing is still a joy for me. I’ll be coming with my son on guitar, he’s a hot young guitar player. Hopefully, they’ll get their money’s worth.Ray Wylie Hubbard will perform at the Georgia Theatre on Friday, Dec. 1 with opener Kevn Kinney.

1-Dec-17,Georgia men’s basketball battles through stomach sickness at Wooden Legacy,"The Georgia men’s basketball team competed in its first tournament of the year this past weekend at the Wooden Legacy in Fullerton, California, and had some real adversity to overcome from a health perspective in the midst of the event.The Bulldogs played three games from Thursday through Sunday and during that time, many members of the team fell ill.What struck the Bulldogs was a “stomach virus of some sort,” as described by Georgia head coach Mark Fox and sophomore guard Tyree Crump estimated that as many as 11 players on the team were sick.


 


“I think we got through it probably as well as we probably could have,” Fox said. “But that comes with the territory of traveling with a bunch of young guys on the road for a week and it just hit us at a tough time.”Despite so many players having stomach issues, the Bulldogs still faired rather well.The team finished third in the event and capped it off with a win against then-No. 21 ranked Saint Mary’s for Georgia’s first ranked win since defeating No. 25 South Carolina in February 2016.But the grind was far from easy.“I was trying to be mentally tough,” senior forward Yante Maten said. “I didn’t really have too much energy because I couldn’t eat. Good athletes and good competitors find a way to push through whatever adversity they are going through at the time. So I just tried my hardest to just get through it.”The sickness was getting so bad that Georgia was having players exit the game so that they could throw up in multiple games in the tournament.“We had guys that were getting sick during the game,” Fox said. “We had someone leave the game in the middle of the San Diego State game and a couple of guys in the Saint Mary’s game so it obviously was something that impacted us.”At the end of the day, though, Georgia had no choice but to play on.


 


And that is a mentality that the Bulldogs adopted to overcome their stomach issues and pick up their best win of the young season thus far.“If you’re gonna compete, it shouldn’t matter,” Crump said.",Collin Huguley | Staff Writer,sports,https://www.redandblack.com/sports/mens_basketball/georgia-men-s-basketball-battles-through-stomach-sickness-at-wooden/article_08ab94fe-d6c6-11e7-8947-73af0d22dc67.html

3-Dec-17,UGA professor talks about  new book 'The Far Right in America' and the rise of far right movements in the U.S.,"The author and political scientist talks about his new book and the background behind far right movements.

The Red & Black: Your book is aimed towards non-academic readers, so what specifically is the far right, and what are some broad characteristics that define it?


 


Cas Mudde: The far right is kind of a container concept to describe both extreme-right groups, which are against democracy persey. The idea that the people elect their leaders --- they’re against that. A classic [example] would be neo-Nazis, for example, just believe there should be one leader who does everything.And then the radical right which accepts that the people elect their own leaders but they have problems with certain aspects of liberal democracy like minority rights and classic white supremacists often have that where they’re, by and large, fine with the broader system of the United States, they just think it should work for the whites rather than others.So those are kind of key features. In the U.S., the far right is very diverse. You have very small groups of higher-educated young people like the so-called alt-right, and then you have the classic Ku Klux Klan which is moster lower-educated people in rural areas.You have neo-Nazis, you have skinheads, but you also have strong forces within or around the Republican Party, which are people who are like, in suit, well-educated to play regular politics. It is a broad concept.R&B: You’ve researched politics for many years: Was there in anything in particular about the American far right that you found especially fascinating during your research for this book or in general?CM: I moved to the U.S. almost 10 years ago, and I had been studying the far-right in Europe for about a decade. One of the things I noticed when I came here was that there was very little attention to the far right, and many of my students had no idea what that referred to.I started to write blog posts and op-eds about certain developments that I found remarkable and were underplayed like the militia movement and later the Tea Party and then the recent transformation within the GOP.It was mostly because so few authors were writing about it, and so I just thought that given my knowledge of the same phenomenon in Europe, that could help even though I don’t argue that the American far right is just a product of European far right or even of the same process of globalization.


 


There’s something fundamentally American about the American far right. I think it is important to take it more seriously both for academics but also for regular population.R&B: What is the appeal for people in the U.S. or even in Europe to join for what seems to be fairly radical political groups?CM: The groups are very different, and so particularly for the smaller, more extreme groups it’s almost always just wanting to belong. That is what attracts people to neo-Nazi groups and skinhead groups.It’s often people who have reasonably marginalized lives who feel more powerful because they’re in this group that is feared. The Tea Party is a much broader phenomenon in which there are far right aspects, but not all.Sometimes that is very attractive for people who people who hold far right ideas but live in a public social context where that is kind of not accepted. It is better to be part of a group that overall isn’t associated with the far right, but where it is tolerated.The Tea Party wasn’t a far right movement as such, but it had various far right people in it and subgroups. My argument is that the Republican Party is not a far right party, but there are quite a lot of radical right politicians in it, and at the moment it is predominantly campaigning on radical right agenda.It is much easier to make anti-immigrant statements within this structure of a Republican Party than in an isolated radical right group because you can say, “Well this is just mainstream politics.” You can’t really say there is this one thing that attracts it because the groups are so different.R&B: What is the internet’s role in spreading far right ideology?


TNCMS.AdManager.render({region: 'fixed-big-ad-bottom-asset', slot: 1, fold: ""below""});


CM: Social media plays a role for everything. One of my arguments is that social media is important for the radical right and the far right, but it’s important for everyone.So you if you talk about specifically the group that’s called the alt-right, that is largely an internet phenomenon, it’s largely a social media phenomenon. But if you talk about the Klan, for example, it predates it, and even today most Klans don’t have even have a website. That’s much more just interpersonal relationships.What you see is that we live more and more in echo chambers in which echo chambers are not just groups where people have the same idea, but where people get radicalized. Certain topics become more and more important and their support for their position becomes more intense.And you see that is important for the radical right as well as the radical left --- it radicalizes people. I think the U.S. has that even stronger, and one of the things you see here is that almost a whole conservative echo chamber has moved radically to the right since the rise of Trump, and particularly since Trump became the candidate.Before he became the nominee for the Republican Party, within the conservative field there were a lot of people against Trump and were in favor of Cruz or others. Now you see it also on Fox News which again initially was anti-Trump and very critical. Now it’s almost like state propaganda and everything that comes out of the White House uncritically amplified.It has helped the far right kind of almost capture mainstream right which is important but at the same time, it is important that even today, Fox News is way more important than any Twitter account. Social media plays a role, but mainstream media is still more important.R&B: Where do you think the disdain for more centrist political supporters comes from, and why do you maybe see people moving towards different political poles?CM: Actually for a long, long time, the far right in Europe, for example, during the Cold War part of it fought that liberalism was more dangerous than communism. Communism was still collective and so closer to nationalism, whereas liberalism was in their opinion, had no values and atomized the individual.

Today what you see, and I think that’s very interesting, there is next to by and large a kind of an establishment radical right that works within the Republican Party and believes that the Republican Party is as such, the right vehicle for it.There is this movement that wants to blow up the Republican Party, and Steve Bannon of Breitbart News is the most important example. He literally wants to replace the Republican Party elite. His first and foremost battle is with the conservative establishment rather than with liberalism.That is something really new, and it’s difficult to say what it is because Bannon is a very specific person, he has a vehicle for it that he didn’t found but actually just got from someone else like Breitbart who started it and then got massive money to develop it.He’s not necessarily the outcome of a social movement, and so there is obviously widespread frustration with the establishment of both parties. In part that has to do I think with the fact that politics has become more and more consensual, parties work closer and closer together. They don’t really differ much majorly on the major issues.Both on the left and the right, people who are more ideological got frustrated. With people like Bannon and what he stands for, there seems to be almost a personal or classist kind of argument even though Bannon himself is of course partly a similar type of establishment. The argument is that these type of people are bad, they’re corrupt, they’re not pure, they’re not real Americans.It’s a sign of the times, you see that also in Europe, you see that around the world, this populism coming up, and Bannon is really good at using this, but it is important that this was the core of the Tea Party. What I develop in my book, in various essays is that to a large extent, Trump is kind of the outcome of the Tea Party. The people who are mobilized by the Tea Party are similar type of people who were mobilized by Trump and Trump’s agenda which was to a large extent the grassroots of the Tea Party. We’re talking about a phenomenon that has deeper roots than just Trump and Bannon.",Hamilton Armit | Contributor,culture,https://www.redandblack.com/culture/uga-professor-talks-about-new-book-the-far-right-in/article_2c621b0a-d844-11e7-a07f-0b7abb3844c6.html
4-Dec-17,OPINION: Betsy Devos' visit to Atlanta is not enough,"The Red & Black publishes opinions from a number of contributors and staff columnists. Their opinions do not reflect the opinions of the editorial staff. The editorial staff is in no way involved with the opinion pieces published with the exception of editorials. Editorials are written by the editorial board consisting of the opinion editor, managing editor and editor-in-chief. Editorials are clearly marked EDITORIAL at the beginning. This article is from opinion editor Jaime Conlan, a sophomore entertainment and media studies major. Although this article is from the opinion editor, it does not reflect the opinions of The Red & Black as a whole.The state of education appears to be under siege in the last month, with new reports on unhealthy school lunch plans, education challenges for Native Americans and the unpopular “grad tax” bill. There is much work to be done across the board, and who better to help with these issues than the United States Secretary of Education, Betsy DeVos?


 


With Betsy DeVos only completing 68 percent of her required work days during her first six months, it may be best to look elsewhere. The fact is that Betsy DeVos is not focused on her job, nor is she tuned in to the most important educational matters. DeVos’ trip to Atlanta may appear like a good thing, but it is nowhere near enough.DeVos visited Georgia State University’s Atlanta campus to discuss the potential to streamline the financial aid application process. DeVos’ big idea was to create an app for students to apply for aid while protecting personal data on financial aid forms and making the process of filling out the forms easier, according to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution.While this certainly could be a good idea that would solve some problems, it is unclear how many problems the app will actually be capable of addressing or if DeVos’ plans for the application will come to fruition. With an already confusing website or paper forms, it’s possible that an app would just be another platform for obstacles.So many other problems also currently face students, including some that DeVos herself has created. DeVos rolled back the Obama-era policy on sexual assault on college campuses, which many have disagreed with. The president of the National Women's Law Center, Fatima Goss Graves, was one such critic. “It will discourage students from reporting assaults, create uncertainty for schools on how to follow the law and make campuses less safe,” Graves said in a statement.There are so many problems facing educational institutions today. Other than the meeting in Atlanta about the app, DeVos has been focused still on her school-choice plans which many say would privatize public schools and run them as a business.To provide context for what DeVos’s responsibilities are, the U.S. Department of Education’s website states that “the Secretary is responsible for the overall direction, supervision and coordination of all activities of the Department and is the principal adviser to the President on Federal policies, programs and activities related to education in the United States.”DeVos has not spoken up about the federal grad tax issue yet. Her voice could make a difference and inspire support or change, but her lack of comment speaks more to the kind of disconnect between DeVos and the wants of students who must actually deal with the education system for which she works.

11-Dec-17,Are text messages among government officials public records? Missouri's top lawyer says yes,"JEFFERSON CITY • Attorney General Josh Hawley says text messages are public records under Missouri’s open records law, raising fresh concern about fellow Republican Gov. Eric Greitens’ use of a secretive app that deletes text messages after they’ve been read.Hawley said his office policy – and legal view — was that text messages sent or received by state employees about state business should be subject to the same rules as emails when it comes to public records under the state’s Sunshine Law.“Our view is that text messages are like emails,” Hawley told reporters Monday during the presentation of a new program for veterans in his office.


 


That doesn’t necessarily mean all text messages would be made available upon request, just as all emails are not.“There is a process for determining what is a record. What’s a closed record? What’s an open record? Our view is that text messages are emails in that respect and should be subject to the same analysis,” Hawley said.His comments came as Greitens called reports about the use of the app Confide within his office “fake news.”“This is another nothing story that’s come from a liberal media outlet that is just desperate for salacious headlines,” Greitens said during a separate briefing in Bellefontaine Neighbors.The Kansas City Star reported Thursday that Greitens and members of his senior staff had the app Confide downloaded to their personal cellphones. The app deletes messages and prevents recipients from saving, forwarding, printing or taking screenshots of messages.It is the latest in a series of incidents that point to a governor who prizes secrecy, ranging from not revealing how much donors gave to his inaugural celebration to installing a lock on the door to his press office.The Confide revelation triggered a call from Sen. Scott Sifton, a Democrat from the Affton area, for Hawley to investigate the governor and his staff for potential open records law violations.Hawley confirmed he is reviewing case law to determine whether to appoint a special investigator. He said he cannot directly investigate Greitens because his office is already defending the governor in other legal cases.


 


“It’s a very complicated issue,” Hawley said. “The legal complexities are significant. We’ll have more for you soon.”The Sunshine Law statute also gives jurisdiction on the issue to the Cole County prosecutor. He could not immediately be reached for comment Monday.It remains unclear whether the governor and his staff are using the app for state business, campaign work or other government communication, or for personal matters.Parker Briden, the governor’s spokesman, told the Star he was unaware of anyone in the governor’s office downloading the app to a state-issued device.But Hawley said he believes the law also would cover text messages about state business being sent on private cell phones.“I don’t think it settles the matter just because it is a private device or a personal device. That alone, I believe, would not qualify that as a non-record,” Hawley said. “This is one of the difficulties we face with a Sunshine Law that was written decades and decades ago and has not been updated to take into account modern technology.”Meanwhile, Hawley, who is running for the GOP nomination for U.S. Senate, unveiled a plan to create a program to provide free legal help to military service members.The new Military Legal Assistance Team will work with attorneys from military bases in Missouri to find private attorneys who will provide free services to service members with certain legal needs.

A new advisory board will determine which legal needs would qualify for the program and create a strategy for recruiting attorneys to provide the help.“I can’t think of a better way for the law profession to give back to our troops,” said advisory board member John Comerford, a former Navy officer who is a partner at the Dowd Bennett law firm in St. Louis.","By Kurt Erickson

15-Dec-17,"Police Blotter: UGA stolen art equipment, headphones and found bicycle","University equipment stolen from classroomThe University of Georgia Police Department was dispatched to the Lamar Dodd School of Art on Dec. 5 for a report of a theft of nearly $1,600 worth of equipment.When police met the reporting party on scene, the student informed police he had left his Sony Handycam, a 64 gigabyte SD card and a P300 Pico projector unattended in a classroom for approximately two hours. When he returned to pick up the items, they were missing.


 


Since the student had checked out the items from the Lupin Foundation Technology and Research Kiosk, all three of the items are owned by the university.Stolen bicycle found at Main LibraryA bicycle that was reported stolen in October was seen at the UGA Main Library on Dec. 6.The owner of the bicycle informed police about the bicycle before proving it was his by unlocking it twice with his key. While one officer stood by the bike, the other went inside the library to find the person who had placed the bike there.The suspect was located and transported to the police station before he was later transported to Clarke County Jail.The individual was arrested for one count of misdemeanor theft by receiving of stolen property.Beats headphones lost and foundA pair of Beats by Dre Solo headphones were reported missing on Dec. 4.

15-Dec-17,Studying the Sooners: A deeper dive into Oklahoma’s offensive line,"Before Georgia plays Oklahoma in the Rose Bowl on Jan. 1, The Red & Black football beat writers analyzed each position group for the Sooners. In this preview, Layne Saliba took a closer look at the Oklahoma offensive line.StrengthsWhen the season began, not a lot of attention was given to Oklahoma’s offensive line. Baker Mayfield stole the spotlight and has been doing it ever since.


 


But it’s hard not to say the offensive line with the Heisman winner at quarterback behind it isn’t one of the best in the country. And when you’re talking about Oklahoma, that’s definitely the case. The Sooners’ offensive line has protected Mayfield throughout the entire season, allowing him to pass for over 4,000 yards and 41 touchdowns.Although the Oklahoma offensive line wasn’t named a finalist for the Joe Moore Award, given to the country’s best offensive line, it is still an impressive unit to watch.Not only has it helped Baker Mayfield gain national attention, it’s helped the Sooners’ running backs average 216 yards per game on the ground.The place where it holds its advantage is in its size. It’s a big group on the field at an average of 315 pounds, so the match up with the Georgia’s quick defense should be a good one.WeaknessesThere are two things the Sooners’ should be concerned with when it comes to its offensive line. First, it’s the overarching fact that it hasn't seen a defense like Georgia's this season.Georgia is ranked No. 4 in total defense. The best defense Oklahoma has seen this season was Ohio State, which finished at No. 8 in total defense and TCU which finished at No. 19.The Sooners just don’t have the experience on the offensive line they probably want heading into a semifinal match up.Second, it’s the fact that at times, the offensive line is pretty porous. Against Oklahoma State, it gave up five sacks.Now, that was a rivalry games and weird things happen in big games, but the Rose Bowl is a big game. So if Oklahoma lets Georgia’s defense through to Mayfield, it will make things a lot easier on the Bulldogs.",Layne Saliba | Senior Staff Writer,sports,https://www.redandblack.com/sports/football/studying-the-sooners-a-deeper-dive-into-oklahoma-s-offensive/article_56b65696-e1a9-11e7-a22d-2bac988b23ff.html
17-Dec-17,Georgia women's basketball defeats Georgia Tech at home,"The Georgia women’s basketball team defeated Georgia Tech 60-53 on Sunday at home after a road game on Dec. 14. Georgia (9-1) holds a 35-5 series lead against Georgia Tech, and has a 16-0 home record against the Yellow Jackets (9-2).The Bulldogs got a strong second-half performance from Mackenzie Engram and Caliya Robinson, who finished with 14 and 12 points, respectively. The duo help sparked a dominant defensive display for the Bulldogs by holding Georgia Tech to shooting 29.7 percent from the field.“That was fun,” Georgia head coach Joni Taylor said. “I thought it was great momentum. We were able to get some stops, get a shot clock violation and bear down defensively. We executed off the press, and were able to get some easy baskets which fueled our confidence.”


 


Both teams put up a scrappy performance in the opening minutes of the first quarter. Georgia Tech started to find its way by getting the ball inside.Georgia closed out the quarter on a 8-2 run. The run was sparked by the Bulldogs ability to pass their way out of the Yellow Jackets’ full-court press. The Bulldogs took a 18-15 lead into the second quarter.The sloppy play of Georgia continued in the second quarter, as it gave up the ball five times. Red shirt sophomore point guard Taja Cole was struggling as she was over dribbling and not picking the right passes on certain occasions. The Yellow Jackets held Georgia to eight points. Head coach Joni Taylor also had to pull Robinson early in the quarter because she had two fouls.In the third quarter, Georgia began to attack the basket, and started to find Engram and Robinson. The Bulldogs defense stopped letting Georgia Tech enter the paint by taking away the entry pass. From the 5:13 mark to the end of the third quarter Georgia went on a 12-0 run. The Bulldogs took a 46-36 lead into the fourth.Georgia continued its dominate display on defense in the fourth quarter. Georgia Tech brought the lead down to four points, but baskets from Robinson, Engram and Gabby Connally allowed Georgia to pull away.",Yash Bhika | Staff Writer,sports,https://www.redandblack.com/sports/womens_basketball/georgia-women-s-basketball-defeats-georgia-tech-at-home/article_de86ae52-e372-11e7-8a4e-0b55f535fbb9.html
20-Dec-17,Georgia receives commitment from five-star defensive end Brenton Cox,"One-time Ohio State commit Brenton Cox signed with the Bulldogs on Wednesday, giving Kirby Smart and company the No. 5 recruit in the state of Georgia, according to 247Sports’ Composite Rankings.Cox signed his letter of intent at his own Stockbridge High School Wednesday afternoon, in a ceremony broadcasted live by ESPN. Cox, ranked the No. 22 recruit in the nation, was choosing between Georgia and Alabama, evidenced by a tweet Cox posted on Dec. 17.After verbally committing to the Buckeyes in April, Cox de-committed from the school shortly after an official visit to Alabama on Dec. 1. Then, on Dec. 15, Cox visited Athens, a 90-minute drive from Stockbridge.


 


After arriving at Stockbridge High School as a junior, Cox made an immediate impact on the defensive side of the ball, racking up 117 tackles and 23 sacks in his two years with the Tigers.Sports247 ranks Cox the second-best recruit in the nation at the strong-side defensive end position. At 6-foot-4 and 247-pounds, Cox is a talented edge rusher and would likely be in line to take on the roles left vacant by senior outside linebackers Davin Bellamy and Lorenzo Carter.The Bulldogs also received a National Letter of Intent from four-star weak-side defensive end Azeez Ojulari Wednesday morning.",Alex Soderstrom | Senior Staff Writer,sports,https://www.redandblack.com/sports/recruiting/georgia-receives-commitment-from-five-star-defensive-end-brenton-cox/article_5cfd5f32-e5c2-11e7-bf83-cfd802a5fa1f.html
20-Dec-17,Head coach Kirby Smart announces Devonte Wyatt as signee to Georgia,"When Kirby Smart entered the room where he normally speaks to reporters on Wednesday night, he brought a guest with him.Smart started to enter the room, then paused and motioned for a player to come over. A 6-foot-3, 300 pound defensive lineman stuck his head in the door, waved hello and then walked away.That lineman was Devonte Wyatt, one of 17 signees inked by Georgia on the first day of the early signing period. However, Wyatt’s case is different from his fellow newcomers.


 


Wyatt was set to be a part of Georgia’s 2017 recruiting class. However, he didn’t academically qualify for admission to Georgia and played the 2017 season at Hutchinson Community College in Kansas.The Decatur native played in 11 games for Hutchinson, registering 30 total tackles and three sacks. Now, he is enrolled at Georgia and beginning to practice with the team, although he won’t be eligible to play until next season.Despite the change in his initial plan, Smart said the year at Hutchinson was beneficial in Wyatt’s development on the field because he didn’t have to wait behind more experienced players.“Here you are coming in with a couple of senior defensive linemen, so he gets to go and play,” Smart said. ""He got to play, he got to watch tape and see him play.”The year of junior college didn’t just help Wyatt on the field. He reaped the benefits off the field as well.“They did a really great job out there of preparing him, taking some college classes,” Smart said. “It’s almost like a mini-13th grade. I thought it was really good for him. He was a lot more mature having been out on his own. I think it gives him a better chance at success here.”Next year’s defensive line also looks to be an experienced one. The only contributing senior this season is John Atkins, although juniors Trenton Thompson and Jonathan Ledbetter could still potentially declare for the NFL draft.But next season is still nine months away. For now, Smart is just happy he will have another piece for next year’s defensive unit.“I’m excited about him and glad he can come practice,” Smart said.",Jed May | Senior Staff Writer,sports,https://www.redandblack.com/sports/football/head-coach-kirby-smart-announces-devonte-wyatt-as-signee-to/article_c9396678-e5d1-11e7-8af3-275c5cde61f0.html
20-Dec-17,Jamaree Salyer reveals why he committed to Georgia,"ATLANTA — Jamaree Salyer and his Pace Academy teammate Realus George took to the stage around 10:00 am on Wednesday for the first-ever Early Signing Day. While George had been committed to play for Mark Richt at Miami since Nov. 12, the fullback still needed to put the pen to paper and sign his National Letter of Intent.As for Salyer, his college decision had yet to be revealed. The five-star offensive guard sat down next to George and their high school coach Chris Slade, as family, friends and college football fans crowded the room at Sports & Social at The Battery Atlanta.Following a few questions for George and Slade, Salyer took over the microphone for the big reveal.


 


The 6-foot-4, 342-pound senior in high school reached under the table and pulled out a grey Georgia hat.“I will be continuing my next four years of college at the University of Georgia,” Salyer said.The decision came down to Clemson and Georgia, and Salyer ultimately zeroed in on Athens as his home for the next three or four years. His choice came on the heels of an official visit to Georgia’s campus last weekend.“I just needed to make sure I was at home and my family was at peace with my decision,” Salyer said. “After that, we were good.”Salyer is considered the No. 1 player at his position and No. 10 player overall in the country for the Class of 2018. He will join the No. 2 offensive guard Trey Hill at Georgia, as Hill committed to the Bulldogs on Dec. 11 and made it official on Wednesday.Despite his elite blocking ability, the attribute that stands out the most for Salyer — at least according to his high school coach — is his character off the field.“He’s not just a five-star football player,” Slade said. “He’s a five-star person ... He epitomizes exactly what a student athlete should look like.”Then again, it certainly did not hurt his case that Salyer was ranked the top offensive guard in the country, according to the 247Sports Composite. At Georgia, Salyer will play alongside Hill and possibly the No. 2-ranked offensive tackle Cade Mays. And that’s leaving out the bevy of elite offensive linemen that signed with Georgia a year ago in the Class of 2017.This surely played into the decision process for Salyer, who couldn’t help but smile as he considered the ceiling for Georgia’s offensive line.“I think the sky’s the limit, honestly,” Salyer said. “I think we got a lot of potential first-rounders that come out when this class is all said and done.”",Zach Shugan | Staff Writer,sports,https://www.redandblack.com/sports/football/jamaree-salyer-reveals-why-he-committed-to-georgia/article_50882470-e5af-11e7-91bf-3b8fab63c2b8.html

Along with four-star cornerback commit Chris Smith, Wilson will compete with returning corners Tyrique McGhee, fellow Miami product DeAndre Baker, Ameer Speed and Eric Stokes, among others.Wilson was also pursued by other SEC schools such as South Carolina, Florida and Alabama.

21-Dec-17,"Head coach Kirby Smart explains expectations of early enrollees, updates status of Zamir White","Jacob Eason, Issac Nauta, Jake Fromm.For the past two years players who have enrolled early have found success at Georgia — some becoming starters, like those three, and others, solid contributors to Georgia’s success on the field.Georgia head football coach Kirby Smart sees this year as no different. With the success on the recruiting trail, the competition will likely be on an even bigger scale.


 


While he did not name any names, Smart expects 8-10 early enrollees for the upcoming spring semester.“The expectation for them is to come out and compete,” Smart said. “Each one of those guys that comes in mid-year will be at an advantage a little bit cause they will be able to practice and get used to our system to help us next year.""Three of that group, according to Smart, will be of the newly signed offensive line. One of the early enrollees will be Zamir White, a five-star running back from Laurinburg, North Carolina, who made his commitment official with Georgia on Wednesday.Despite coming off an ACL surgery, White is expected to still go ahead with his plans to enroll early, but he will be limited.White will be rehabbing his knee but is expected to be with the team throughout the entire process. Smart does not plan to have him available for the spring game, and his status for next fall is still unknown.In losing seniors like Nick Chubb, Sony Michel, Lorenzo Carter and Davin Bellamy, many roster spots will be up for grabs. Smart is in full position to treat the early enrollees just as he would any other player on the roster.“Those mid-year guys come in full-throttle with the expectation of coming and competing,” Smart said. “There will be some guys that started this year that are going to have some really talented people coming in behind them and compete with them.""",Michael Hebert | Staff Writer,sports,https://www.redandblack.com/sports/football/head-coach-kirby-smart-explains-expectations-of-early-enrollees-updates/article_75c51d5e-e656-11e7-910d-0f7dc045500b.html
22-Dec-17,Georgia crushes Temple to improve to 9-2 heading into conference play,"The Georgia men’s basketball team made, perhaps, its most emphatic statement of the season on Friday afternoon at Stegeman Coliseum.The Bulldogs welcomed the Temple Owls, ranked No. 12 in the nation in RPI according to NCAA.com, to town and crushed them for a dominant 84–66 win to improve 9-2 on the year in Georgia’s last game before conference play begins on Dec. 31 against Kentucky.Georgia dominated the game in multiple facets, notably on the glass with a 48–30 rebounding advantage, and the Bulldogs (9-2) took good care of the ball in turning it over only nine times. Aside from a second-half stretch where the Bulldogs went over six minutes without a field goal, Georgia played a nearly flawless game.

        Senior forward Yante Maten led the Bulldogs with a monster day, as he registered a season high of 30 points along with 12 rebounds. And Georgia’s stifling defense thwarted an Owl offense that shot just 40 percent from the field, including 31 percent in the first half.“I was really proud of our team’s defensive effort,” Georgia head coach Mark Fox said. “We changed our lineup for that reason, just to have the best defensive start we could have. And every guy on our team bought into what we did today. Because we felt like getting off to a great defensive start would be a way to win the game.”The Bulldogs got off to a little bit of a slow start in the opening minutes of the game, going down 7-2. But they responded with a 17-2 run to take a 19-9 lead and took off running from that point on.Maten had 15 first-half points to along with seven rebounds and the Bulldogs were sharp in every aspect of the game.“I was just trying to find my sweet spots,” Maten said. “I started off kind of slow but then I ended up finding my rhythm very quickly and just tried to make the most out of every opportunity and if not, try to get my teammates a better shot.”Georgia shot 52 percent from the floor and out-rebounded the Owls 25-11 in the first 20 minutes of play. The Bulldogs also turned the ball over just four times.And at the halftime buzzer, freshman forward Nicolas Claxton tipped in a missed shot just fractions of a second before the clock hit zero to send the crowd into a frenzy and give Georgia a resounding 42-23 lead heading into the locker rooms.


 


“I think [the tip-in] kept us focused going into halftime and knowing that we had to come out and keep our foot on the gas,” Claxton said.The second half proved to be, mostly, more of the same.Georgia continued to do its thing and aside from hot shooting from Temple’s Obi Enechionyia who had 27 points, 7-for-9 from 3-point range, the Bulldogs stayed comfortably ahead.Outside of Maten, Georgia had a fairly even distribution of positive contributions.Claxton (14 points, nine rebounds), Jordan Harris (eight points, three steals) William “Turtle” Jackson II (10 points, four assists) and Derek Ogbeide (eight points, eight rebounds) all had effective games in a well-rounded performance for the Bulldogs, who’s 9-2 start is the best of the Fox era.And the team now appears to be clicking on all cylinders after a blowout win over a good Temple (7-4) team.“Nic [Claxton] had an opportunity today to make a lot of plays and he completed them,” Fox said. “So it was good to see that. It was good to see Jordan [Harris] put together a complete game. A lot of guys contributed today to the victory.”",Collin Huguley | Staff Writer,sports,https://www.redandblack.com/sports/mens_basketball/georgia-crushes-temple-to-improve-to---heading-into/article_c0ac022a-e759-11e7-8ff8-4b8e36eec03b.html
28-Dec-17,Georgia women’s basketball beats North Florida in final non-conference game,"In the final game before Southeastern Conference play begins on Sunday, the Georgia women’s basketball team beat North Florida by a score of 75-37 on Thursday afternoon in Athens. With the win, the Lady Bulldogs improved to a record of 12-1 on the season going into conference play. The 12-1 record matches Georgia’s best start under head coach Joni Taylor, who came in her first season as head coach in 2015-16.The Georgia defense held North Florida to 37 points, the lowest point total of a Georgia opponent this season. 


 


Freshman Maya Caldwell led the team with 15 points, going 4-for-5 from 3-point range. Junior Caliya Robinson also scored in double digits with 13 points, and senior Mackenzie Engram tallied nine points. “I’m proud of the way the team came out,” Taylor said. “We had two good practices off of the Christmas break which isn’t common coming off Christmas. They practiced well the two days leading in to today. They had their focus, and I was really happy that we were able to give a lot of our players extended minutes.”Robinson scored nine points in the first quarter alone, fueling a 19-2 first-quarter run for Georgia that put the Lady Bulldogs up 21-6 heading into the second quarter, topped off by a layup from sophomore Stephanie Paul at the buzzer. Georgia’s scoring run continued in the second quarter when freshman Gabby Connally and Engram hit consecutive 3-pointers. The Lady Bulldogs went on an 8-0 run at the end of the half to hold North Florida scoreless for the final 5:07 of the first half. North Florida scored only 10 points in the first half, the lowest point total of a Georgia opponent in a half this season.The Georgia offense kept rolling in the second half with three baskets from Engram to open the third quarter.

He’s buried on the inside linebacker depth chart behind junior Roquan Smith, senior Reggie Carter, junior Natrez Patrick and even freshman Monty Rice.But Crowder didn’t need to play linebacker to leave his mark on the Rose Bowl. Instead, he made one of the more unusual plays of Georgia’s season on special teams.


 


After Oklahoma went up 31-14 with six seconds left in the first half, the Sooners attempted a squib kick. Sooner head coach Lincoln Riley said at halftime that the goal was to “just try not to kick it and hit somebody.”However, Crowder had other ideas. He quickly grabbed the bounding ball and fell down, setting Georgia up at the Oklahoma 47-yard line with six seconds left in the half.“I looked, and once I saw it in the air I just went on and attacked it with my hands,” Crowder said. “It came pretty fast, but I mean I saw it.”The Bulldogs cashed in on the play, as redshirt sophomore Rodrigo Blankenship nailed a career-long 55-yard field goal to trim the deficit to 31-17 at halftime.The play that set up the field goal was vital to Georgia’s eventual comeback in the second half. Instead of being down three scores at the intermission, the Bulldogs were instead within just two possessions.But while it looked like a purely instinctive play, Crowder said practice has helped him prepare for situations such as the one he found himself in on Monday.“When we get on our drops in our linebacker drills, coach always makes us break fast and react fast with our hands,” Crowder said. “I would say that helped me out a lot.”It’s been a long journey for Crowder to get on the field at the Rose Bowl on Monday. He came to Georgia as a middle-of-the-pack prospect, a two-star wide receiver recruit according to 247Sports. He redshirted the 2015 season before having a big G-Day game in 2016.


 


But during the 2016 season, Crowder was moved to linebacker. He rarely gets on the field defensively, although he is a fixture on special teams.But when he was needed most, he came through for his team.“When he has to contribute, he’s there,” junior defensive lineman Jonathan Ledbetter said. ""You call on him, he’s there. It’s good to have a player who you can call on at any random moment, who sacrifices whatever he’s got to sacrifice for this team. He’s one of those players.""",Jed May | Senior Staff Writer,gameday,https://www.redandblack.com/gameday/tae-crowder-s-play-on-special-teams-led-to-pivotal/article_a17fcfbc-ef88-11e7-92fd-c383ce358ea1.html
2-Jan-18,Change is good: Adjustments put Georgia one step away from national title,"PASADENA, Calif. - Change is nothing new for Georgia senior outside linebacker Davin Bellamy.Throughout his five-year stint in Athens, Bellamy has had three defensive coordinators and two head coaches. He’s also had to adjust to sometimes being asked to play more defensive end, and sometimes having to play outside linebacker.Nobody is going to be confusing the 6-foot-5, 245 pound Bellamy for a chameleon any time soon. However, just like a chameleon, Bellamy said the key to adaptation is the ability to feel comfortable in any given situation.


 


“You’ve got to be transparent, man,” Bellamy said after Georgia’s 54-48 Rose Bowl victory over Oklahoma on Jan. 1. “You’ve got to be able to blend in to every situation.”Also a redshirt senior is defensive back Aaron Davis. He’s seen all the changes in Athens over his time there, but he said he prefers to keep such things out of his mind as much as possible.“I try to focus on today, we’ll see what happens tomorrow when tomorrow happens,” Davis said. “I deal with the things that have happened, and a lot of them are out of my control, things that I don’t have anything to deal with. I just accept it, get my reaction off it and move forward.”Being able to adapt has been key in the successful careers of Bellamy and Davis, as well as the other upperclassmen on the teamNow, in Georgia’s most successful season since 1982, the willingness to embrace adjustments has Georgia one win away from a national championship.On several occasions this season, the Bulldog defense has started off slow. Notre Dame was able to hit a couple big plays early, Missouri put up 21 points in the first half and Auburn started fast in the SEC championship game.In all three of those games, the Georgia defense adjusted its attack and stymied the opposition for most of the remainder of the game. Those three opponents combined to score 13 points in the second half of those games.“It just speaks to the resilience, man,” Davis said. “Guys are hungry, guys don’t want to lose. We crawl, we scratch, we do anything we can to come out with a victory.”


 


On Jan. 1, the ability to adjust in-game propelled Georgia to a victory in its biggest game of the season.Facing off against Oklahoma in the Rose Bowl with a spot in the College Football Playoff national championship game up for grabs, the Bulldog defense was shredded early. The Sooners scored touchdowns on their first three possessions and racked up 31 points and 360 total yards in the first half of play.At halftime, the Bulldogs had to tell themselves they were better than the performance they put on in the first half.“That’s something that’s not acceptable,” Davis said. “We let them run the ball, we let them get some passes off and that just really wasn’t us. We had to go in, lock in and know that we’re still Georgia football and this game isn’t over with.”Indeed, the second half was a totally different affair. The defense gave up just 10 points to the Sooners after halftime, allowing the Georgia offense to bring the team back into the game en route to a 54-48 overtime win.“We know they had like 20 to 25 scripted plays they’ll come out with early,” Bellamy said. “Once we stopped that, we knew they’d go back to their tendencies, and that’s exactly what they did.”All the changes the older defenders have gone through has aided them in their ability to switch things up during the course of a game. As junior defensive back Deandre Baker said, it’s a mentality that the defense has to not give in no matter what the situation.“I feel like we’ve just got more will to win,” Baker said. “We never give up. No matter if we give up a 90-yard play, we get them down to the 10, we still got a expectation of getting a turnover or holding them to three points.”

Bellamy credited this defensive trait to wanting to play for the other members of the defense. He said that no matter who the defensive coordinator has been, he and fellow senior outside linebacker Lorenzo Carter have made a point of playing for the players next to them.Whatever the reason, it’s became clear that you can’t judge this Georgia defense by how it starts a game. On several occasions this season, the starts have been downright ugly.But when they need to, the Bulldogs bow up.“This is the definition of grit,” junior defensive lineman Jonathan Ledbetter said. ""We’ve got determination and it just comes from within, man…Like you see, the second half, we came out and we did what we had to do. We turned that thing on and that’s what Georgia does. We answer the call every time.”",Jed May | Senior Staff Writer,gameday,https://www.redandblack.com/gameday/change-is-good-adjustments-put-georgia-one-step-away-from/article_9a73c462-efd8-11e7-9a97-9fb5f076a622.html
2-Jan-18,Red zone experience helped Georgia's defense in overtime against Oklahoma,"PASADENA, Calif. – The last time Georgia played in overtime, Kirby Smart was on his way to coach in the College Football Playoff not with Georgia, but Alabama.Before the 54-48 double overtime win Georgia pulled out over Oklahoma in the Rose Bowl on Monday, November of 2015 was the Bulldogs’ most recent overtime contest, a 23-17 win over Georgia Southern.At that time, current Miami head coach Mark Richt was still roaming the sideline in Athens, many of Georgia’s current players were not in college yet and Smart was the defensive coordinator at Alabama.


 


Still, the Georgia defense was more than ready when the game headed into overtime on Monday evening, thanks to the similarity between overtime situations and an aspect of football the team is forced to practice constantly.“We do have overtime scenarios during practice,” defensive back Aaron Davis said. “It’s really like playing in the red area, which is something we practice every single day.”College football calls for an overtime where each offense gets a chance to score from the 25-yard line. For a defense, this is nearly identical to stopping an offense in the part of the field known as the red zone or red area, the space inside the 20-yard line.When it comes to defending the red zone, the philosophy of Georgia’s defense is as straightforward as it gets.“You get down to the red area, you can’t let them in, no matter what happens, you just don’t let them in,” linebacker Lorenzo Carter said.The Bulldogs were true to that line of thinking in the Rose Bowl win, denying the Sooners the end zone in both overtime periods. The Oklahoma offense, which scored six touchdowns in regulation, was held to a field goal in extra periods.The second field goal attempt was blocked by Carter, which gave Georgia the ball back and set up a game-winning score by running back Sony Michel.Red zone defense has been one of the greatest areas of improvement for the Bulldogs this season. A year ago, Georgia was ranked 113th in the nation, giving up points on more than 90 percent of opponent’s trips inside the 20-yard line.


 


Coming into the matchup with Oklahoma, the Bulldogs were ranked 27th in the country in the statistic.While the Georgia defense was burned multiple times in Monday’s game, it was the mentality of the defense in overtime which slowed the Sooners when it mattered most and gave the offense an opportunity to win the game and send the Bulldogs to the national championship.“Trust our training, trust our preparation, and buckle down and stop them when we need it,” Davis said.",Alex Soderstrom | Senior Staff Writer,gameday,https://www.redandblack.com/gameday/red-zone-experience-helped-georgia-s-defense-in-overtime-against/article_85bfd76a-ef86-11e7-9443-5f4939e829e8.html
3-Jan-18,Juwan Parker notches first career double-double in Georgia win over Ole Miss,"Georgia’s shooting guards lived up to the name of their position on Thursday night against Ole Miss.Sophomore Jordan Harris and senior Juwan Parker were on fire shooting the ball en route to the Bulldogs’ 71-60 victory over the Rebels. The guards combined for 30 points off the bench, with Harris contributing 12 of those and Parker adding the other 18.While the 12-point, two-assist night for Harris played a large part in the win for Georgia, it was Parker who perhaps took the crown for the most memorable performance of the game.


 


Against Ole Miss, Parker played one of, if not his best game ever in a Georgia uniform, at least on the offensive end of the court.After entering Thursday night with only three 3-pointers made on the season, Parker added four more to that total off of four attempts. The remainder of his points scored came via free throws, as he hit six of seven from the line.“I just got hot,” Parker said. “Guys like Yante [Maten] and Turtle [Jackson] and everybody else was looking to find me, and I just kept shooting.”The hot hand from Parker could not have come at a better time for Georgia, as the usual go-to scorers did not play their best games. Maten finished the night with 15 points and Jackson finished with just three points.“William Jackson struggled a little bit from three, and that’s normally what he does well,” Ole Miss head coach Andy Kennedy said. “But to their credit, Juwan Parker picked up the slack and that’s what you want to see from a veteran guard.”Parker’s success with the jump shot was not the only part of his game that stood out, however. The fifth-year senior from Tulsa, Oklahoma, reeled in 11 rebounds to go with his 18 points, giving him his first career double-double and new career-highs in both points and rebounds.Following the game, Parker was asked if he was aware that he had just earned his first double-double in a Georgia uniform.“I am,” Parker said with a sly grin on his face. “It’s exciting.”


 


That was all he had to offer on the subject, just a few words on what was one of the best games he has played as a Bulldog. But for those who witnessed Parker pull up and hit three after three on Thursday, the pure joy and excitement he expressed was nearly impossible to miss.After hitting his final 3-pointer in the closing minutes of the game, Parker turned around, pointed three fingers on each hand at the ground and ran back down the court as fans inside Stegeman Coliseum erupted in celebration.“It makes the game so much more enjoyable [when your shots are falling],” Parker said. “It’s already a fun game, but when you can make shots, especially shots people don’t expect you to make, it’s a great feeling.”",Zach Shugan | Staff Writer,sports,https://www.redandblack.com/sports/mens_basketball/juwan-parker-notches-first-career-double-double-in-georgia-win/article_d5928abc-f0f8-11e7-8df5-938db8300a6c.html

3-Jan-18,Georgia hires Memphis assistant as outside linebackers coach,"Georgia’s outgoing outside linebackers coach Kevin Sherrer will be replaced by current Memphis assistant coach Dan Lanning, according to Anthony Dasher of UGASports.com. Sherrer will be leaving at the conclusion of Georgia’s season to become the co-defensive coordinator and outside linebackers coach at Tennessee, but Sherrer will still coach the outside linebackers when the Bulldogs face Alabama in the national title game on Jan. 8.Lanning has served as the inside linebackers coach at Memphis since 2016 and was a graduate assistant at Alabama in 2015, where he helped coach the team’s outside linebackers.


 


Georgia head coach Kirby Smart coached alongside Lanning that year, as Smart was serving in what would be his final season as the defensive coordinator with the Crimson Tide before leaving for Athens. Alabama’s defense finished the 2015 season ranked the third best in the nation and the Tide captured a national title. In 2016 and 2017, Memphis’ defense ranked 106th and 116th in the nation, respectively. The departure of Sherrer means the last holdover of the Mark Richt era is gone from Georgia’s sideline. Sherrer was hired by Richt before the start of the 2014 season, two seasons before Smart was hired to replace Richt as Georgia’s head coach.",Alex Soderstrom | Assistant Sports Editor,sports,https://www.redandblack.com/sports/football/georgia-hires-memphis-assistant-as-outside-linebackers-coach/article_e6701a80-f0d4-11e7-af7a-175c4f602f4f.html
7-Jan-18,Georgia women’s basketball beats Kentucky 56-42 in low-scoring affair,"The Georgia women’s basketball team notched its second Southeastern Conference win on Sunday afternoon with a win over Kentucky (8-9) in Lexington, Kentucky.The win is Georgia’s first over Kentucky since 2014 and its first win in Lexington since 2013. With the win, the Lady Bulldogs remain undefeated on the road and moved to a record of 2-1 in SEC play and 14-2 overall.“This is a good win for our team today,” head coach Joni Taylor said. “We felt like the non-conference schedule really prepared us well to go on the road in league play, and it is no easy task to win back-to-back conference games on the road. Give Kentucky credit — they were really prepared, they got after us and I am pleased to get out of here with a win.” 


 


The Georgia defense kept Kentucky’s offense in check throughout the game, holding the Wildcats to just 42 points, the second-fewest of any Georgia opponent this season. However, the Georgia offense also struggled to produce. The Lady Bulldogs scored just 56 points, the fewest they have scored in a win this season.Both teams struggled to shoot well, which resulted in a low-scoring game on both sides. Georgia finished with a field goal percentage of 27.8, its lowest of the season, while Kentucky shot 20.4 percent. Despite the low scoring total, three Georgia players scored in double digits. Freshman Que Morrison scored 14 points, while senior Mackenzie Engram and junior Caliya Robinson both recorded double-doubles with 12 points and 11 assists each, and freshman Gabby Connally scored 10 points.Although the Lady Bulldogs surrendered five turnovers in the first eight minutes of the game, Georgia took a 15-10 lead into the second quarter thanks to its defense and Morrison’s five points in the first ten minutes of the game.Kentucky closed in on Georgia in the second quarter. Both teams struggled on offense and the Lady Bulldogs took a tight 26-24 into halftime.Neither team was able to score in the first three minutes of the third quarter, and Kentucky finished with just five points in the entire quarter. Georgia took a six-point lead into the fourth quarter. The Lady Bulldogs maintained their lead for the remainder of the game, closing out the 56-42 road win.",Janey Murray | Staff Writer,sports,https://www.redandblack.com/sports/womens_basketball/georgia-women-s-basketball-beats-kentucky---in-low/article_affc713e-f3f8-11e7-b95d-dfb0a3aec01c.html
8-Jan-18,"Drivers warned of heavy Atlanta traffic, weather conditions today","The University of Georgia Bulldogs will bring more to Atlanta than a potential college football title today.Traffic is expected to be one of Atlanta’s biggest traffic problems of 2018, according to WSB traffic radio manager Doug Turnbull.Here’s how this doesn’t happen: telecommute, or do a half-day, or take MARTA. I’m all for being wrong! #ATLtraffic https://t.co/sOCkQR3BtP— Fireball Turnbull (@DougTurnbull) January 7, 2018


 


The College Football National Championship occurs in different cities every year, and this year it’s in the highly-populated downtown area of Atlanta, the same year that UGA is playing in the championship for the first time since 1981.“As a result, traffic will likely be heavier than normal in metro Atlanta for the next three days,” said a Georgia Department of Transportation a press release.Adding to traffic congestion, President Donald Trump will be in attendance.There are also predictions of winter precipitation overnight, according to the Georgia DOT press release, which will potentially create dangerous driving conditions on top of the heavy traffic.“Because the majority of fans of both teams playing in the national championship are within driving distance of Atlanta, we expect a large influx of vehicles on the roads as fans will likely be driving here to attend events or the game,” said the press release.Bridie Stein, junior biology major from Woodstock, is used to this non-stop traffic. However, in recent years from an influx of people and additions to sports teams, her commute is now longer.“I live less than two hours with no traffic from Athens, [but] it’s standard now to take me almost four hours to get home, regardless of time of day,” Stein said.


 


Considering the circumstances on Jan. 8, this commute would likely be longer than four hours. To avoid this, Stein travelled back home on Friday to attend the game.The Georgia DOT suggests avoiding driving in Atlanta altogether but told drivers to expect delays and prepare ahead of time if they had to go into the city.Governor Nathan Deal closed all non-essential state offices in the area in anticipation of the weather and traffic.“Out of an abundance of caution, we are closing non-essential agencies to ensure our employees’ safety as well as ensure the Georgia Department of Transportation’s ability to maintain and treat our roads,” said Deal in the press release. “This closure will run from Columbus across to Augusta and northward. The Capitol will remain open, however, so that the Legislature may gavel into the 2018 session as constitutionally required.”The Georgia Institute of Technology followed the governor’s lead and cancelled classes today as well.“Due to a forecast for inclement wintry weather tomorrow morning and the expected traffic issues around the college football championship tomorrow evening, Georgia Tech will close campus and cancel classes,” read an email sent to Tech students.Both Tech and DOT warned drivers to use caution if they have to go out and be aware of the congestion.",Ashley Soriano | Contributor,athensnews,https://www.redandblack.com/athensnews/drivers-warned-of-heavy-atlanta-traffic-weather-conditions-today/article_41c03eee-f439-11e7-9acb-ff6d808ea8a4.html
9-Jan-18,Georgia's late-game offensive stagnation opens the door for Alabama come back,"ATLANTA — When Mecole Hardman scored an 80-yard touchdown, the longest play on the season for Georgia, with 6:52 left in the third quarter of the national championship game against Alabama to give Georgia a 13-point lead, it appeared the Bulldogs were on the cusp of ending a championship drought of more than 35 years.After being shut out in the first quarter, Georgia had started to score at a steady pace, and the Crimson Tide defense did not appear to have enough to outlast the Bulldog offense.Then, something changed. Georgia failed to score again for the final 23:08 of regulation, and the offensive players were forced to watch from the sidelines as the lead they had built slowly slipped away.


 


So what happened?“I really don’t know,” redshirt freshman offensive lineman Ben Cleveland said. “They stepped their game up, and then we couldn’t do anything to counteract. So they started scoring points, and we couldn’t stop them.”Junior receiver Terry Godwin, who did not catch a pass in Georgia’s scoreless fourth quarter was less complimentary of his championship opponents.“Alabama didn’t shut us out,” he said. “We hurt ourselves. We made self-inflicted penalties, cost ourselves yardage. A couple of mistakes here and there, and they ended up catching up to us at the end.”Godwin said the team’s failure to execute when it mattered most was the biggest contributing factor in the Bulldogs failure to close out the win.Sophomore tight end Isaac Nauta had much the same to say, lamenting the fact that his team’s failures in the most crucial moments of the contest erased the dominant first three quarters Georgia played against the Crimson Tide.“The thing about football that sucks is the best team doesn’t always win,” Nauta said. “It’s just the team that plays the best in certain moments.”And in the most crucial moment, the Bulldogs’ first and only overtime possession, Georgia was clearly not the better team.


 


With the game on the line, the team ended up losing nine yards in three plays and settling for a 51-yard Rodrigo Blankenship field goal attempt. Blankenship made the kick, but failing to get into the end zone gave Alabama the opportunity to win the game with a touchdown, an opportunity the Crimson Tide did not squander.Hardman, who scored both of Georgia’s touchdowns, said the stagnation of the offense in overtime had more to do with what Georgia did than any adjustments the opposing team made.Alabama didn't win the game, according to Hardman. Georgia simply lost it.“It ain’t nothing Bama did to us,” he said. “We let them do it.”",Nathan Berg | Senior Staff Writer,cfp,https://www.redandblack.com/cfp/georgia-s-late-game-offensive-stagnation-opens-the-door-for/article_924e07fa-f50c-11e7-a3d5-df94b71d6687.html
9-Jan-18,Report: Jacob Eason expected to transfer to Washington,"According to a report from The Seattle Times, Georgia quarterback Jacob Eason is expected to transfer to Washington now that Georgia’s 2017 season has concluded.Eason, who started 12 games for the Bulldogs in 2016 and entered the 2017 season as the starter, is a former five-star recruit from the town of Lake Stevens, Washington.  Based on NCAA rules, Eason would have to sit out one year at Washington, giving him two years of college eligibility left in the 2019 and 2020 seasons.


 


After an injury in the first game of the 2017 season sidelined Eason, freshman Jake Fromm relieved the sophomore and never relinquished the starting role.

10-Jan-18,Georgia men's basketball falls to Missouri 68-56 on the road,"Georgia basketball head coach Mark Fox has been quoted time and time again as an advocate for his team to play a “complete 40-minute game.”Wednesday against Missouri, Georgia played well enough in the first half to hold on to a three-point lead into halftime.But after the half, Georgia (11-4, 2-2) struggled, turning the ball over and allowing Missouri (12-4, 2-1) to get into transition to earn fastbreak points. That in turn created a run that Georgia was unable to recover from, losing to the Tigers, 68-56.


 


Georgia got off to a good start on the offensive end, using players like William Jackson II to orchestrate an offense that was insistent on moving the ball.The Bulldogs looked to have an advantage on the boards, highlighted early with some nice interior play from Nicolas Claxton, showing off his athleticism.Despite Georgia outrebounding Missouri 24 to 18, it was a defensive battle in the first half.Missouri was able to limit Georgia to 31 percent shooting in the first 20 minutes, and found a way to make some big shots down the stretch to cut into Georgia’s lead.The second half was a different story for Georgia on the offensive side of the ball.Missouri’s momentum on the defensive end increased ten-fold in the second half, as the Tigers got quick points in transition off of Georgia turnovers.Scoring points off turnovers was huge for Missouri in the second half, allowing them to jump out to a margin as large as 16 points.While Georgia has some lone bright spots such as Turtle Jackson scoring 10 points and Tyree Crump scoring 10 of his own, the turnovers and inability to protect the ball spelt defeat for Georgia, and they were never able to close the margin.


 


Missouri had four scorers in double figures highlighted by Jontay Porter, who dominated on the interior matched up with Yante Maten, scoring 15 points and grabbing 10 rebounds.On the other hand, Maten wasn’t up to his typical performance offensively, mustering nine points and two rebounds.Missouri’s Kassius Robertson was very efficient from the guard position, scoring 15 points with five rebounds as well.Missouri run in second half that resulted in the 68-56 victory was due to an ability to take advantage of turnovers, scoring 16 points in those instances.That, along with winning the turnover battle in the second half and edging out Georgia 38 to 36 for the game allowed Missouri to cruise to the easy victory.",Michael Hebert | Staff Writer,sports,https://www.redandblack.com/sports/mens_basketball/georgia-men-s-basketball-falls-to-missouri---on/article_0a50cf9e-f689-11e7-bdf7-4794a0b323ea.html

11-Jan-18,"Column: Buckle up, Georgia-Alabama is college football’s new premier rivalry","Monday night’s College Football Playoff National Championship Game was an encounter that will live in college football lore forever.With a 41-yard touchdown pass from Alabama quarterback Tua Tagovailoa to wide receiver DeVonta Smith, the Crimson Tide fired the final shot in a classic national title game to complete a 26-23 comeback win and down the Georgia Bulldogs.But if the nature of the game and the trajectories of the respective programs are any indicator, this battle very well could be the first of many.


 


Kirby Smart and Georgia shot first with a dominant first half, shutting the Tide out in a first half for the first time since 2007.Nick Saban then cooked up his own adjustments, particularly in benching quarterback Jalen Hurts for a true freshman in Tagovailoa, who has never started a game. And Alabama finished the job, despite some shaky placekicking, and now reign once again atop college football.Aside from Tagovailoa’s heroic 166-yard, three-touchdown passing effort after halftime, Saban also pulled another trick out of his sleeve in the form of a 6-foot-2, 227-pound monster of a running back in true freshman Najee Harris, who sparked the Tide offense with 64 yards on just six carries and gashed the Georgia defense with his size and physicality.Georgia’s true freshman quarterback Jake Fromm had an up-and-down game, but proved what he was capable of all season long in going 12-2 as Georgia’s starter and winning the SEC Freshman of the Year award.But ultimately, Tagovailoa outshined Fromm, two quarterbacks certain to be compared for the remainder of their collegiate careers, as the game’s outstanding first-year passer.With these types of players as young staples in the offensive backfield, it opens the door for each team’s offense to try and live up to the elite level that both head coaches demand out of their defenses.However, the offensive potential and defensive excellence of both teams will be sustained on the recruiting trail, where both programs have dominated.Georgia’s 2018 class is currently ranked No. 1 in the nation according to the 247Sports Composite Team Rankings, while Alabama’s is ranked No. 5 after spending years inhabiting one of the top spots in those rankings.While the talent of both teams appears set up to be as good as it gets in college football, the aspect that takes a rivalry from good to great is the emotions that fuel it.The connection between Saban and Smart will always be there, as the former longtime Saban understudy has appeared to build Georgia in the same mold in which Saban built Alabama with physicality up front, a dangerous running game and impeccable defense.These are also two schools in neighboring states that could be set up to clash for the SEC championship in Atlanta, the home of Monday night’s title game, for several years to come. If early predictions are accurate, it appears that both teams are favorites to win their respective divisions and meet again in the 2018 SEC title game.But the at the heart of this budding rivalry is the exact script that ended Monday night’s encounter.The Bulldogs blew a double-digit fourth-quarter lead before losing in walkoff fashion in overtime and were forced to watch the Tide celebrate the fifth national title of the Saban era in their home state.The ultimate heartbreak.Alabama’s final shot to end the first battle of the Saban versus Smart version of the Georgia-Alabama rivalry is what sets the stage for more drama down the road.Georgia will retreat back to the drawing board, work to replace key seniors such as Nick Chubb, Sony Michel, Lorenzo Carter and Dominick Sanders, among others, and try to fight its way through a vulnerable SEC East field.But if Georgia is to get to the pinnacle, there will always be Alabama waiting for them.Whether it be in the SEC title game or an unusual circumstance such as an All-SEC national championship game, the Tide and the Bulldogs are meant to stand toe-to-toe. And the showdowns could repeatedly take place on the same Mercedes-Benz Stadium field in which the first one did.The smoke has slowly begun to clear from Monday night. Alabama won the battle.But who will win the war?",Collin Huguley | Assistant Sports Editor,sports,https://www.redandblack.com/sports/football/column-buckle-up-georgia-alabama-is-college-football-s-new/article_5026356a-f646-11e7-ada7-d7d1b8d3b436.html

“When [Robinson] plays the way she did tonight, she’s hard to stop,” head coach Joni Taylor said. “The only person who can really stop Caliya is herself, and that’s a conversation that we’re always trying to have with her, because she’s capable of so much.”The scoring opened in the first quarter for Georgia with two straight jumpers from Engram. The Georgia defense got off to a strong start, holding Arkansas to just seven points in the opening frame and enabling the Bulldogs to pull out to a 15-7 lead going into the second quarter.The Georgia defense continued to show its strength in the second quarter, holding Arkansas to just six points in the first five minutes of the quarter.Georgia’s offense went cold late in the second quarter, going zero for its last seven field goals of the first half for a total of over four scoreless minutes. The lack of offense at the end of the half allowed Arkansas to pull within six points of Georgia at 31-25.In the opening minute of the second half, Georgia ended its scoring drought with a layup from Engram for the team’s first points in nearly five minutes. Despite Robinson’s eight points in just the third quarter, Arkansas pulled within 50-49 thanks to three Georgia turnovers in the third quarter.At a crucial moment early in the fourth quarter, with Georgia up 59-58, Engram made a layup to put the Bulldogs up by three after Arkansas’s Devin Cosper missed a 3-pointer that would have given Razorbacks their first lead of the game.“They were missing shots and we were making shots, so I think a teeny-weeny part of us got lucky, because they were missing a lot of wide open shots, especially threes,” Engram said. “But we also knew, defensively, we had to turn it around, and then offensively, get the ball inside more.”Throughout the rest of the quarter, Georgia bent but did not break. Arkansas pulled within one point multiple times, but Georgia never surrendered the lead, winning 78-65 and adding a third conference win.


 


“I think we bore down on the defensive side of the floor and we got a stop when we needed to,” Taylor said. “That just speaks to the maturity of our upperclassmen, and the resiliency for them to understand the momentum shift it would cause if [Arkansas] did take the lead.”",Janey Murray | Staff Writer,sports,https://www.redandblack.com/sports/womens_basketball/georgia-women-s-basketball-beats-arkansas-behind-strong-performances-from/article_32e2c22e-f73c-11e7-be4d-539ddc0e5f3f.html
11-Jan-18,"Against Arkansas, Georgia found success defending long-range shooters","The Georgia women’s basketball team focused on Arkansas’s strengths to defeat the Razorbacks 78-65 on Thursday at Stegeman Coliseum in Athens.Prior to squaring up against Georgia, Arkansas ranked second in the SEC in most 3-point field goals made with an average of 7.9 per game and third in the SEC for fewest turnovers with 12.4 per game.On the other hand, Georgia hasn’t found the same success with its long-range shooting. The Bulldogs ranked eighth, six places below the Razorbacks, in the SEC for 3-point field goals made with an average of only 5.4 heading into Thursday's game.


 


But Arkansas, known to be heavy with the 3-point shots and light on the turnovers, struggled to find rhythm against the Bulldogs who concentrated their defensive efforts on Arkansas’s outside shooters.“That was a big point of emphasis or us is to not let them get going from the outside,” senior Mackenzie Engram said. “We knew who the shooters were and who we could and couldn’t hop off of.”Georgia held Arkansas to one 3-point field goal in the first half, but the Razorbacks fought back with a 3-point basket by junior Bailey Zimmerman within the first three minutes of the third period. Before facing the Bulldogs, Zimmerman averaged 2.4 points per game. Zimmerman earned two more in the fourth period, causing Georgia head coach Joni Taylor to call a timeout.“[Our defensive strategy] was to play shooters as shooters, play non-shooters as non-shooters knowing that some of their non-shooters are capable of shooting it and making it,” Taylor said. “We just made an adjustment there.”And with that, Georgia held Arkansas to two free throws for the remainder of the game.The Razorbacks finished the game with half the average 3-point shots made and five more turnovers than average per game. This marked Arkansas’s second lowest total 3-pointers made this season.“We made a run, they made a run, basketball is a game of runs,” Engram said. “We just needed to keep the lead and that’s what we did. We hung our hat on the defensive end.”

11-Jan-18,Malury Bates and Bianca Blanaru step in because of the absence of Stephanie Paul,"The Georgia women’s basketball team entered Thursday’s game against Arkansas without Stephanie Paul due to injury. With her loss, it meant reserve forwards Bianca Blanaru and Malury Bates had to provide minutes for the second group.The duo combined to play for 14 minutes, but they provided consistence defensive help for Georgia’s 78-65 win over Arkansas.“I thought they both were prepared, and they were ready when their number was called,” head coach Joni Taylor said.


 


Taylor was impressed with the toughness Blanaru showed, and she pointed to a play where she took a charge, but was called for a blocking foul after further review.Blanaru and Bates both put up an impressive defensive performance. They were making it hard for Arkansas to attack the paint, and both of them used their bodies to interfere with the Razorbacks shots.Mackenzie Engram and Caliya Robinson were not surprised by what they saw from the backup forwards. Robinson said their effort in practice made playing in the game simple.“I think Malury [Bates] just has to get her lungs up under her, and I think Bianca [Blanaru] does great when she’s in,” Engram said. “So just keeping their confidence high [is important].”Blanaru and Bates only managed to score two points, but Taylor was not concerned about the output on the offensive end. She insisted they were not the number one option on offense, and they did a good job of taking up space for the offensive plays to develop.“Unless they’re catching [the ball] at the rim, we're not looking to give them the ball,” Taylor said. “I’m totally happy with what they did, and I think they are too.”",Yash Bhika | Staff Writer,sports,https://www.redandblack.com/sports/womens_basketball/malury-bates-and-bianca-blanaru-step-in-because-of-the/article_8114a15e-f748-11e7-95f4-4378b86f9936.html

13-Jan-18,Offense around Yante Maten fails in Georgia’s home loss to South Carolina,"In Saturday’s loss to South Carolina, Yante Maten led the Georgia Bulldogs with 25 points but it was not enough to lead a struggling offense to victory.Outside of Maten, the Bulldogs had just two players score more than three points and the entire team shot just 35.3 percent from the field as they were smothered by an aggressive Gamecock defense.“[South Carolina] just played up,” Maten said. “That’s how South Carolina’s defense is. They try to play you up so you have to get off of your spot or a certain pass isn’t there that usually is. It’s just a disruptive type of defense.”


 


According to South Carolina head coach Frank Martin, the Gamecocks did not want to double Maten too often because of his ability to find the open man when doubled.Instead, the Gamecocks tried to force Georgia’s supporting cast to create for themselves instead of strictly playing through the team’s best player.“What we didn’t want Georgia to do was play off of the catch,” Martin said. “We wanted them to have to play off of the dribble…For the most part, that’s what we [made them do]. We made their guards have to score off of the dribble.”The guards for Georgia struggled mightily on the day.While Juwan Parker had a solid day with 11 points on 3-of-6 shooting, the other players were not effective. Junior William Jackson II had a dismal game with nine points and shot just 3-for-15 from the field. Sophomore Jordan Harris also struggled in going 1-for-5 from the floor.Georgia’s offense was disjointed all game long and the Bulldogs were forced to create a lot of their own shots as opposed to utilizing ball movement. The team finished with just eight assists total and it was proven that outside of Maten, the Bulldogs struggle to create their own offense.“[The Gamecocks] are very physical,” Georgia head coach Mark Fox said. “They’re a hard team to pass and catch against so you end up trying to dribble the ball a lot…This is a game where your guards have to make plays off of the bounce and we didn’t make enough of those.”Despite having a player that is a leading contender for the SEC Player of the Year award, the Bulldog offense has been weak recently as a complete unit.


 


Georgia has put up 56 and 57 points in each of its last two games and if the Bulldogs are to turn things around after losing both of those games, the team’s offense is going to have to find some balance to accommodate Maten.“I think everybody has to get consistent, myself included,” junior forward Derek Ogbeide said. “[We] just really [need to] get things going and thriving offensively.”",Collin Huguley | Assistant Sports Editor,sports,https://www.redandblack.com/sports/mens_basketball/offense-around-yante-maten-fails-in-georgia-s-home-loss/article_d0c557b4-f8ad-11e7-a181-23e19b8f0182.html
13-Jan-18,Georgia men's tennis won eight matches total in first day of 2018 MLK/Georgia Tech Invitational,"The No. 4 Georgia’s men’s tennis team began the 2018 MLK/Georgia Tech Invitational, which kicked off Saturday at the Ken Byers Complex on Georgia Tech’s campus, with five singles and three doubles wins.In singles, Paul Oosterbaan, who was injured last season, returned to the courts to take a dominant 6-1, 6-1 win over No. 122 Timothy Wang of Columbia.“It was obviously great to see Paul come out with a win after not playing for the majority of last season,” head coach Manuel Diaz said.


 


Along with Oosterbaan, Alex Phillips, Wayne Montgomery, Robert Loeb and Jan Zielinski won against their Columbia opponents, giving the Bulldogs an overall strong initial showing in singles.To go along with the five singles victories, the duo of Oosterbaan and Nathan Ponwith, along with the team of Montgomery and Walker Duncan, helped Georgia to take an aggressive start in doubles play.Emil Reinberg and Alex Diaz picked up the final doubles victory of 7-6 (4) in a close match against Columbia’s Austen Huang and Rian Pandora.“In doubles, we played ok and got three wins, but we have plenty of improvements to make,” Diaz said.",Jesssica Clayton | Contributor,sports,https://www.redandblack.com/sports/tennis/georgia-men-s-tennis-won-eight-matches-total-in-first/article_08a9c16a-f8cc-11e7-888b-87a1646e4265.html
14-Jan-18,Gabby Connally leads Georgia to overtime victory over No. 17 Texas A&M;,"Georgia (16-2, 4-1) got its first signature victory of the season, after knocking off No. 17 Texas A&M (14-5, 3-2) 92-82 in overtime in College Station, Texas, on Sunday afternoon.Georgia almost won the game in regulation after Gabby Connally hit a three-pointer with 1:45 seconds left to play, but Texas A&M’s Chennedy Carter, who had 31 points, hit a contested 3-pointer to tie the game 73-73 to send it to overtime.The Bulldogs had no problem putting the Aggies away in overtime. Mackenzie Engram, who finished with 23 points and seven rebounds, hit a crucial corner three to allow Georgia to cruise to the victory.


 


“Coach Taylor tells me to be more aggressive, and today I was able to do that,” Connally said. “I had some open looks and my teammates told me to just let it fly. We know it is never easy to com down here and get a win so I am so happy for this team.The Bulldogs relied on the brilliance of Connally, who had 37 points and four assists, to knockdown free throws, and hit timely shots. Georgia needed a performance from their backup point guard because Taja Cole only had four points and turned the ball over five times.“Gabby lives for these moments,” head coach Joni Taylor said. “We want the ball in Gabby’s hands. She can drive, she can score and she can make things happen. We put faith in her and she delivered today in front of so many friends and family who made the trip. I am happy for her and so proud of our team for fighting to get a big road win.”Both teams struggled at the beginning of the game, but Georgia’s Engram and Caliya Robinson, who finished with 18 points and 19 rebounds, began to find their groove on offense. With three minutes left in the first quarter, Engram hit a 3-pointer which sparked a 8-2 run. Georgia took a 19-9 lead into the second.The Aggies offense started to come into its own when Carter started to take over the game. She was creating chances for herself by dribbling past Georgia defenders. She scored seven points in a span of two minutes to pull Texas A&M within three.Georgia had six turnovers in the second quarter, however, Connally was able to calm the offense down by hitting jumpers, she had ten points in the first half. Georgia took a 38-31 lead into halftime.Georgia continued to shoot the ball well, and played good defense in the third quarter. Connally had five quick points, but was taken out because she got a third foul. Once she went out, Georgia got sloppy with the ball, which allowed Texas A&M to get back in the game.The Bulldogs went scoreless in the last three minutes of the third quarter, and Texas A&M took a 54-52 lead going into the fourth.


 


The Bulldogs continued to be careless with the ball, and gave it away four times in the first five minutes of the fourth quarter. Texas A&M took advantage of the sloppy play, and at one point held a five point lead. But Haley Clark hit three free throws, and Que Morrison got a layup within a minute of each other to tie the game.Georgia held three point lead with twenty seconds left to play, but Carter was able to bank a 3-pointer off the glass to tie the game.Connally and Engram continued to carry Georgia’s offense in overtime while Texas A&M started to settle for bad shots. At 1:54 mark, Connally drove to the basket and used the backboard for an easy finish. Connally iced the game away by knocking down free throws, and led Georgia to the win.",Yash Bhika | Staff Writer,sports,https://www.redandblack.com/sports/mens_basketball/gabby-connally-leads-georgia-to-overtime-victory-over-no-texas/article_52d31edc-f97e-11e7-99fd-f38f167153b2.html

Dickson and junior Sydney Snead also had strong performances on floor for the GymDogs, each posting a 9.925. The 9.925 score marked a career-high on floor for Snead.“We had been working on landings, because that’s where we had gotten quite a few deductions in the meet on Monday,” head coach Courtney Kupets Carter said. “Our mentality was, we have five kids up, five kids need to hit.

21-Jan-18,Georgia women's basketball improves to 17-2 with win over Auburn,"The No. 24 Georgia women’s basketball team defeated the stingy Auburn Tigers 60-48 on Sunday  at Stegeman Coliseum.The Bulldogs (17-2, 5-1) had trouble establishing any type on rhythm on offense in the first half because the Tigers (10-8, 1-5) were applying a diamond zone defense. It wasn’t until Georgia’s Haley Clark drove to the basket at the 6:52 mark in the third quarter, which awoke the Bulldogs on offense.Mackenzie Engram shot 9-of-16 from the field for 22 points and had eight rebounds. The majority of her points came in the second half. Another player, who had a big impact for Georgia was Taja Cole. She went 2-for-5 from the field for 10 points, and she finished with two steals.


 


Georgia head coach Joni Taylor described Cole’s performance on the defensive end as the catalyst for the teams win.“We kind of got stuck in the corner sometimes,” Cole said.  “You really want to keep the ball in the middle, and I think we made the adjustment in the third quarter.”The opening six minutes of the first quarter, Auburn was frustrating Georgia by playing a diamond zone defense. The Bulldogs continually turned the ball over, and they only managed to score when playing in transition. Gabby Connally entered the game at the the 3:59 mark in the first quarter, and she struggled to command the offense. She was constantly being trapped by Auburn defenders, and whenever she made a pass it was being picked off. Georgia and Auburn were tied 9-9 going into the second quarter.Taylor was not worried about Connally’s performance in the first quarter.“Once [the freshmen] get out there and get their feet wet they get an understanding of what got them in trouble,” Taylor said. “They’re smart, they make adjustments and that’s what happened in the third quarter.”The second quarter was just as sloppy as the first quarter. Georgia and Auburn kept turning the ball over on offense, and points from both sides only came from in the paint or from free throws. Cole was hit with an unsportsmanlike call at the 5:53 mark which gifted the Tigers two points.Throughout the first half, Auburn continued to trap Georgia players on the perimeter. That defensive intensity lasted the entire half, and it was highlighted with both teams turning the ball over 29 times. The Tigers defense held Georgia to shooting 28.2 percent from the field in the first half. Auburn took a 25-22 lead heading into the locker room.


 


“Most of the turnovers were unforced,” Taylor said. ""It was a mistake on our parts. We were just throwing it over our head or dribbling it to the corner. We were doing silly things.”Georgia made more of an effort to drive to the basket to breakdown the Auburn press in the third quarter. Clark drove from the bassline for a layup. She had six points in the quarter alone. Her drive to the basket ignited the crowd, which led Georgia to a 9-2 run.“It gave us a lot of momentum,” Clark said.  “Hearing [the crowd] cheer us on, and hearing them get loud for us gave us so much momentum, and it kind of gives us a fire in our but.” Clark also mentioned that at halftime, Taylor preached to the team about being more aggressive on offense.With under a minute left to play in the third quarter, Cole drove past three Auburn defenders for a layup. Georgia took a 42-35 lead going into the fourth quarter.Georgia continued to ride the momentum of the crowd for the rest of the fourth quarter. However, Auburn still managed to force Georgia into committing turnovers. But, Engram sealed the win by hitting a corner 3-pointer with under two minutes left in the game. Georgia defeated Auburn 60-48.",Yash Bhika | Staff Writer,sports,https://www.redandblack.com/sports/womens_basketball/georgia-women-s-basketball-improves-to---with-win/article_9a99883c-fef6-11e7-a65e-6367b9e3b575.html
31-Jan-18,Georgia track and field becoming one of the nation’s most complete teams,"Coming into 2018, the Georgia track and field team is looking to create a new culture surrounding the anatomy of the team’s success.Georgia’s track and field teams are off to their best start in arguably the program’s history. Three meets into the indoor season, the men’s team and the women’s team are both ranked second in the nation.Head coach Petros Kyprianou’s new approach to the assembly of his team has helped strengthen his team from last year. In the 2017 outdoor national championships, the women’s team fell short of a title by 1.8 points to finish second behind the University of Oregon. The women’s side also came in second to Oregon in last year’s indoor national championships.


 


Georgia only brought six girls to the outdoor championships. All were on the field events side of the competition. On the opposite end, Oregon won the women’s outdoor national championship by only participating in track events.Kyprianou’s formula for success comes from his dependence on his heavy-hitters on the field.“I never say we try to win with just field events, but you have to stay true to your niche,” Kyprianou said. “As good as we are with the running back position in football here, you can consider that our niche is with the jumps and the throws.”Kyprianou in recent years has depended on the success of his field teams to overshadow some of the weaknesses on the track.Fortunately for him, Kyprianou has one of the nation’s best field event teams.So far this indoor season, Georgia holds the best marks in the women’s long jump and triple jump, and the team is second in the high jump.On the men’s side, sophomore Darius Carbin and junior Keenon Laine hold top 10 spots in the nation for the high jump. In the shot put and weight throw, junior Denzel Comenentia has made throws that rank in the top 3 in the nation for both events.As always, the success of the field events on the men’s and women’s sides are proving to be the team’s biggest strength. But after coming up short twice in last year’s national championships, Kyprianou recruited or developed what could be the missing ingredients in the almost complete recipe.For the women’s team, true freshman Lynna Irby has been the rising star with the nation’s best times in the women’s 400-meter and 200-meter. Irby is changing the team’s culture and identity to strengthen the team on both sides of competition.


 


“It’s tough to create a new culture when your culture is already in the field events,” Kyprianou said. “But I just don’t have the patience to wait 10 years until I win a national title.”The process of creating an all-around team came through a major recruitment pick up this offseason with Irby. But for the men’s side, the progression to adding more pieces to a national championship team have been developed over the years.For now, senior Cejhae Greene holds the fifth fastest time in the nation in the men’s 60-meter. Junior Kendal Williams helps to add support with his top 14 time in the 60-meter as well.Three differences on the track side of the team have finally made Georgia a threat on the field and track. Their performances and rankings have proved so far that Kyprianou’s team is very capable of competing and possibly winning national titles.With one more meet left before the SEC indoor championships, Georgia hopes to add more national qualifying ammunition to its run at a title in March.“I would love to hope this is our year,” Kyprianou said. “I’m tired of second place.”",Quentin Vanhoozer | Contributor,sports,https://www.redandblack.com/sports/track/georgia-track-and-field-becoming-one-of-the-nation-s/article_18977c14-068e-11e8-8e58-6fb44fff67b3.html

3-Feb-18,Review: Justin Timberlake returns with confusing mix of genres,"In anticipation of Justin Timberlake’s upcoming Super Bowl LII performance, his latest album, “Man of the Woods,” was released on Feb. 2.As his first album in five years, Timberlake has faced criticism for the disparity in sound. Though the sound ranges wildly throughout “Man of the Woods,” Timberlake does produce a handful of enjoyable tunes with more twangy, soulful bits to faster, hip-hop inspired beats. The album isn’t connected like it should be, but it does contain songs that would’ve been best as stand-alone tracks.“Filthy,” the first single of “Man of the Woods,” is the most similar-sounding to Timberlake’s older music. The track has an nice techno-pop emphasis and showcases the Timberlake’s classic falsetto. He uses lines from Snoop Dogg’s “Gin and Juice” with the line “Your friends, my friends and they ain’t leaving till six in the morning (six in the morning).” The clever interpolation and techno-pop sound make “Filthy” one of the best, if not the best, songs on the album.


 


The third track, “Sauce,” is sonically confusing. With guitar riffs that could’ve come out of a Southern rock song and Timberlake’s signature vocals, the pairing doesn’t exactly add up, especially since it follows “Filthy.”The following song is “Man of the Woods,” the title track. Though the overall sound is still baffling, it doesn’t feel as out of place as “Sauce.” Though the title might suggest some country influence, in an Instagram video, Timberlake mentioned that his son’s name, Silas, means “of the woods” and that he named the album after him.“Stop telling me I’m making a country album,” Timberlake laughs in the video. I feel like @djkhaled right now!!! NEW SONG ALERT! Birthday vibes! Thanks everybody for the bday love!!! And the cut @nellichristine. #ManoftheWoods #MOTWA post shared by Justin Timberlake (@justintimberlake) on Jan 31, 2018 at 1:02pm PSTIn “Say Something,” like in “Morning Light,” Timberlake features another award-winning artist, Chris Stapleton. The two pair up to croon about feeling the need to “say something” and getting “caught up in the rhythm of it.” The song sounds heavily influenced by country, though it does have some pop and electro sounds.“Young Man,” the final track of the album, features Timberlake’s wife, Jessica Biel, and their son, Silas, in the introduction. Thematically, the song is comparable to tunes like Will Smith’s “Just The Two Of Us” and “Beautiful Boy” by John Lennon. Likewise, Timberlake’s song is an ode to his young song, to whom he gives advice throughout the track.Despite the pop icon Timberlake used to be, “Man of the Woods” is a jumble of various sounds that don’t mesh like they should. The songs together in an album is a bit jarring and perhaps the result of the past dry spell Timberlake has experienced since 2013.

3-Feb-18,Georgia GymDogs score season high on bars against Missouri,"The Georgia gymnastics team scored a season-high 49.325 on the uneven bars during Saturday’s meet against Missouri.Starting the season with only five competitors on the event, it looked like bars might be the source of weakness for the GymDogs.On Jan. 19, the GymDogs added Jordyn Pedersen to the lineup to create a complete lineup. Proving she belongs, her score on the event on Saturday was the third-highest on the team with a 9.85. Competing as the anchor for Georgia, the score was a season and career high for Pedersen.


 


No one was more excited about Pedersoe’s performance than her roommate and teammate Rachel Dickson. The duo has a pre-performance tradition of high-fiving, but today, Dickson said she added reminding Pedersen that “she deserved it” right before she stepped onto the mat.“She worked so hard in the gym every single day and she went out there and showed it today,” Dickson said. “As you could see, we were all so excited for her. I couldn’t give her a bigger hug after that.”Dickson herself put up the tied highest-score as she and freshman Marissa Oakley scored a 9.9 on the event. Demonstrating the attention to detail that the team worked on during practices leading up to the meet, both gymnasts competed quality handstands and finished with a stuck landing.Oakley, whose score was a season and career-high on the event, said she especially focused on her landings this week, as it has been a problem that has plagued her throughout the season thus far.“We’ve been working so hard and we all know we are capable of doing that so to be able to get that in the meet when it counts was really awesome for us,” Oakley said.In preparation of each meet, the GymDogs compete in an inter-squad meet the day before competition, and head coach Courtney Kupets Carter sets score goals for each event. For today’s meet, the goal for bars was a 49.2, and the GymDogs exceeded that goal by over a tenth of a point.“Yesterday, we had an amazing practice,” Dickson said. “Everything she said, we hit, and I think that helped us today because we knew that we could achieve those scores.”Kupets Carter, who won a bronze medal on the uneven bars in the 2004 Olympics, has emphasized the importance setting goals and the process more than the results to her gymnasts since her arrival at Georgia.


 


Continuing that mindset into today, she said she is pleased with her team’s performance and their progression on the event, but she can see the room for improvement.Her goal for her team on bars today was to be aggressive. In fact, Kupets Carter told her team that she would rather see a few bobbles on the event because they were being aggressive than to see them told back.The aggressive mindset paid off as the GymDogs not only achieved their season-high on bars but also their overall season-best score with a 197.0.“They all tried really hard to make sure that they were doing their skill the way they knew they should and not just getting ahead of themselves,” Kupets Carter said. “That's the biggest thing right now. We have a long way to go in the season, but if they can focus within themselves now, it will really help them in the end.”",Brittany Stewart | Contributor,sports,https://www.redandblack.com/sports/gymnastics/georgia-gymdogs-score-season-high-on-bars-against-missouri/article_dd58c3a6-092b-11e8-b51b-abb26aaaa53c.html
5-Feb-18,Georgia basketball’s Pape Diatta contributes in first meaningful minutes back from injury,"Big performances from players on the bench have been few and far between for the Georgia men’s basketball team this season and have had varying impacts. They could result in a major reason why Georgia wins a game, such as when Tyree Crump scored 17 points to defeat No. 11 Saint Mary’s 83-81 in overtime on Nov. 26. Other times they may have no impact on the game at all, but still jump out as noteworthy. 


 


Take for example, Pape Diatta’s performance in the 72-57 loss at Mississippi State on Saturday. Diatta came seemingly out of nowhere to hit 4-of-4 3-pointers to finish with 12 points and was one of the few bright spots on offense for Georgia (13-9, 4-6). The junior logged 18 minutes, the first time he had seen more than 10 minutes on the floor since Nov. 24 in a loss to San Diego State. What has held Diatta back this season is not his performance in practice or games. Rather, it was an ankle sprain that he suffered last summer that kept him out of a majority of workouts. ""[Diatta] practiced with a big plastic brace up until the new year,” Fox said. “He spent the month of January trying to develop more strength in the ankle.”Fox indicated that, although Diatta had improved over that stretch, he still was very far behind due to missing team workouts, practices and having to sit out of games. On Saturday, Diatta got a chance to play and showed that his ability to shoot the ball could be an asset to Georgia. With a team that has struggled in certain games from the 3-point line, shooting around an average of 32 percent from deep, Georgia has an opportunity to explore options with players such as Diatta to help improve their woes in that area.


 


“Working him back in has been a challenge,” Fox said. “[But], he’s finally healthy. He’s starting to play and practice well.""",Michael Hebert | Staff Writer,sports,https://www.redandblack.com/sports/mens_basketball/georgia-basketball-s-pape-diatta-contributes-in-first-meaningful-minutes/article_cd307d50-0aa4-11e8-b479-77466b685541.html

7-Feb-18,Georgia men's basketball falls to 4-7 in SEC play with road loss to Vanderbilt,"For the Georgia men’s basketball team on Wednesday night, the Bulldogs found a way to make a run of their own to try to defeat Vanderbilt on the road. But it was already after Vanderbilt made one of its own in the first half.The Commodores got hot from the perimeter and continued that late in the second half to get on a run that Georgia (13-10, 4-7) couldn’t stop. Vanderbilt (9-15, 3-8) ran away with the game in an 81-66 victory over the Bulldogs.“I think that we’re not playing nearly as well as we were earlier in the year,” Georgia head coach Mark Fox said.


 


Vanderbilt guards Riley LaChance and Saben Lee each had 19 points while Peyton Willis had 13. The three combined for eight of Vanderbilt’s 11 3-pointers and the Commodores shot 11-for-24 from behind the 3-point line.Vanderbilt didn’t waste any time getting going early in the first half. It jumped out to a 9-0 lead thanks to five quick points from LaChance by way of a layup and 3-pointer.Georgia’s offensive struggles were evident once again as the Bulldogs didn’t break double digits until the 9:33 mark in the first half.Juwan Parker, who finished 13 points, and Yante Maten (20 points, six rebounds) were a few of the bright spots in the first half for what seemed like a lack of efficiency on offense for Georgia.The Bulldogs were able to cut it to eight and trailed 39-31 at the half.The Georgia offense found some success when it began to utilitze Maten in the interior. The senior was able to find success with post-moves and layups, and at the free throw line as he hit 4-for-5 on the night.Maten was a big reason why Georgia was able to cut it to a one-point game with Vanderbilt leading 48-47 around the 13-minute mark.“We played unselfishly, we threw the ball inside,” Fox said. “We had a couple stops in a row, but we just didn’t sustain that effort at all.”


 


However, Willis and LaChance got their chance to shine from the 3-point line. The two hit four 3-pointers down the stretch that proved to be too much for Georgia and the Commodores rode their hot hand en-route to the victory.",Michael Hebert | Staff Writer,sports,https://www.redandblack.com/sports/mens_basketball/georgia-men-s-basketball-falls-to---in-sec/article_f70df4f8-0c80-11e8-b2d4-5fd38ea103f7.html
8-Feb-18,Athens tornado siren test scheduled for Friday morning,"If you’re planning to sleep in on Friday, you should be aware that the weather is scheduled to be partly cloudy with no chance of tornadoes.However, Athens-Clarke County and the University of Georgia are conducting a test of the tornado warning outdoor siren system on Friday, Feb. 9.In the event that a tornado does come to Athens, the National Weather Service and the Georgia Emergency Management Agency want to ensure that the Athens community is prepared.


 


At approximately 9 a.m., the 12 sirens located throughout Athens and the UGA campus will sound off to alert individuals in the area of a potential weather threat. This siren test happens annually in coordination with Severe Weather Awareness Week.Since there will not be an actual tornado, it is not required to participate in the test.“Ideally, we’d love people to physically shelter but that’s not an available option in some circumstances,” said Steve Harris, the director of the UGA office of emergency preparedness. “We do hope that people will pause and reflect on what to do, ask questions like ‘Where would we go? What route would we take to get there?’”UGA will also send out a notification Friday morning as though there is a tornado in the area that has touched ground or has appeared on the National Weather Service’s radar. Students may receive a text, email, phone call or desktop notification depending on the preferences they have set with the UGA Alert Emergency Notification System.Several places on campus are also functional places to seek shelter in the event of a severe weather situation. The Ecology Building, Park Hall and the Science Learning Center are among the buildings equipped with a space to seek shelter in this event.Harris said if individuals hear the siren and want to participate, they should go to the bottom floor of their building to a room with no windows since that would be the safest place during a storm.“We want people to think about their plan of action now, during a test, instead of during a panicked situation,” Harris said.",Kaley Lefevre | City News Editor,athensnews,https://www.redandblack.com/athensnews/athens-tornado-siren-test-scheduled-for-friday-morning/article_c62fdc3a-0d06-11e8-9d37-27f341a43c47.html
8-Feb-18,The meaning of HOPE: Scholarship misses lower-income students,"For most University of Georgia students, securing the HOPE or Zell B. Miller scholarships in high school was never a question.According to University System of Georgia data for fall 2015, 98 percent of in-state, first-time freshmen attending UGA received one of these scholarships.Across the state, however, it’s a different story. 


 


Around 62 percent of in-state, first-time freshmen in the university system received either scholarship, with lower-income students having lower levels of eligibility.  According to the Georgia Budget and Policy Institute, both merit-based scholarships are “out of reach for students of modest means.” An analysis from GBPI showed that the scholarships are disproportionately granted to higher-income students.“As a result, low-income students are underrepresented among scholarship recipients in the university system,” a post from the institute said. This trend is noticeable when comparing the median income among Georgia colleges with the amount of students who are receiving these scholarships. At UGA where 98 percent of students have HOPE, the estimated median income is $129,800, according to a study done by the Equality of Opportunity Project based on students from the class of 2013.By contrast, 79 percent of Georgia State University students have HOPE, and the school has a median income of $60,300. At Albany State University, 39 percent of students have HOPE, and the median income is $30,800, according to the same study.With HOPE’s disproportional aid to middle- and upper middle-income families, another trend became apparent to UGA economists Chris Cornwell and David Mustard — the rise of “hopemobiles.”


 


HOPE-ful for a new carAccording to a 2007 study by Cornwell and Mustard, HOPE had a significant effect on the increase in car registrations in counties with increasing numbers of HOPE scholars, specifically in looking at 1994 and 1995, a couple years after HOPE was implemented.Based on their analysis, the economists found the HOPE scholarship money flows toward students who would have attended college without it and did not successfully increase economic diversity in colleges and universities. Since students who receive HOPE tend to have a higher family income, their college funds are re-allocated, a lot of the times in the form of a new car. Mustard said he was inspired to examine the issue after hearing a group of five economics students say they were “bribed” into attending UGA.“She said, ‘Well I was either going to go to Chapel Hill or UGA, but my dad said if you stay here, go to UGA and get HOPE, I’ll get you a brand new car,’  and so she [stayed].” Mustard said. “I went around and the next girl said she had been bribed too … Every single person had the same exact story.”Mustard said the HOPE scholarship was successful in advancing the academic profile of Georgia’s universities but did little to increase widespread access to higher education. “We basically found that the HOPE scholarship does not do a very good job of increasing access [to higher education],” Mustard said. “It really does a better job of increasing choice and keeping high achieving students in the state, but it does not really do a good job of giving students a chance to go to college who wouldn’t have otherwise gone.”

The genesis of HOPEThe idea for the scholarship did not originate in allowing parents financial leeway to buy their children cars. Its beginning can be traced back to the 1990 Georgia gubernatorial race. Candidate Zell Miller needed a way to distinguish himself in the race. Miller believed education was the answer to improving the state, so he paired education reforms with another popular want in Georgia — the lottery. “The best way to address Georgia’s economic stagnation and inequities, according to Miller, was to fund education by any means possible,” said Dr. Michael Lanford in a study analyzing the HOPE scholarship. In 1992, Gov. Miller was able to pass the HOPE scholarship along with the lottery referendum.According to Lanford’s study, HOPE was an incentive to do well in high school and go to college in the state, but it was also designed for social equity.It really does a better job of increasing choice and keeping high achieving students in the state, but it does not really do a good job of giving students a chance to go to college who wouldn’t have otherwise gone.

-David Mustard, UGA economist The scholarship had an income cap of $66,000 when it was first introduced, designed to be high enough to include both middle- and low-income families, said Lanford.HOPE was operating at a surplus in its first couple of years, so the income cap was raised to $100,000. By 1995, the income cap was removed altogether, which is around the same time Mustard and Cornwell found that car sales in wealthier Georgia counties were going up.Without the income cap to promote Miller’s social equity goal, HOPE was being emphasized more as a merit-based scholarship, according to Lanford’s study.Today, HOPE covers 90 percent of tuition after being scaled back in 2011. The Zell Miller scholarship was also created, another indicator of the merit-based emphasis.UGA commits

Without a statewide scholarship to fulfill the needs of lower-income students, UGA President Jere Morehead made increasing need-based aid a focus of his 2018 State of the University Address.During his 2017 address, he announced plans for the need-based Georgia Commitment Scholarship program.Recipients of the scholarship receive more than just financial support, said Tracy Coley, public relations coordinator for the Office of Vice President for Instruction.Coley said one of the goals of the program is to help direct students who may be unfamiliar with how to navigate the collegiate landscape to resources that help them succeed.“They receive more than just money,” Coley said. “They also receive academic support. This program funnels them in because when a student comes in, and they’re not used to having resources, especially at a large university, they might be afraid to ask questions.”The goal for the program is 400 scholarships. So far, around 80 of these scholarships were given out to students for this academic year, according to Bonnie Joerschke, the director of student financial aid.“It’s need-based, so it’s based on the FAFSA, and therefore, low income students are eligible,” Joerschke said. ”We look at the student’s eligibility through that, as well as the donor’s wishes.”

“I thought we had a good week of practice last week,” Diaz said. “The guys, from what I can tell, have a little bit more bounce in their step. The matches this weekend are going to be a lot of fun. We’re really looking forward to going to our national center in Lake Nona and playing in front of a national TV audience on Friday night against Georgia Tech.""Before the televised match, Georgia will face Florida Atlantic University on Thursday afternoon.Florida Atlantic’s head coach, Ricardo Gonzalez, graduated from Georgia in 2007. He was also a senior captain of the 2007 national championship team. This will be his first time head-coaching against his alma mater.On Friday, Georgia will go against Georgia Tech players for a rematch from earlier this season at the MLK Invitational in January. The first time did not count as a dual match, but Georgia came away with nine wins over Georgia Tech players at the tournament.Being a month into competition, Diaz expects more out of their second encounter with their in-state rivals.“I’m sure it will be quite different this time around,” Diaz said. “There was no team winner. Kids were playing for themselves. They tend to get a lot more emotional and come together. The level of intensity is going to be much higher on Friday than about a month and a half ago.”The match against Georgia Tech will be one of the six College MatchDay men’s matches that will be televised on the Tennis Channel.The College MatchDay Series will feature men’s and women’s matches among the top collegiate tennis programs across the country.


 


In an effort to grow the viewership of college tennis, the USTA is displaying some of the best talent in college tennis for a national audience.Six of the teams competing are currently ranked in the top 25 in the nation according to the ITA rankings.“This is a tremendous tribute to the USTA and the things that they’re trying to do with ITA College Matchday to gain new eyeballs and expose the great product that we have in college tennis,” Diaz said.The only time Georgia has been recently televised was for last year’s finals of the NCAA team championships.",Quentin VanHoozer | Contributor,sports,https://www.redandblack.com/sports/tennis/georgia-men-s-tennis-heads-to-florida-for-usta-college/article_22eb5d9a-0cea-11e8-b460-b3bf51e1bcae.html
8-Feb-18,SEC announces preseason predictions for upcoming baseball season,"On Thursday, the SEC recognized Georgia baseball’s Michael Curry as a preseason favorite to be named to the all-conference first team as the league’s best designated hitter.Curry is going into his third season with the team, coming off a sophomore campaign in which he started every game and led the team with 15 multi-RBI games. He was recognized as an All-SEC player at the conclusion of the 2017 season for his role as designated hitter. The Gainesville, Georgia native played 16 games as catcher for the Bulldogs last season in addition to the 41 games he played as designated hitter. His bat is what grabbed the headlines though, as he led the team with 10 home runs and went on a career-best 14-game hitting streak spanning March and April. 


 


Curry has appeared in all but three of the 114 possible games for the Bulldogs in his collegiate career, and has started in all but seven of them. He is the only Georgia player to earn preseason All-SEC honors.

9-Feb-18,Four Fat Cows: Ice cream shop opens Saturday,"College students and families in Athens will have a new place to stop for ice cream and coffee after the grand opening of Four Fat Cows on Saturday, Feb. 10 from 7 a.m. to 10 p.m.The shop, which is located at 723 Baxter St., serves homemade waffle cones, baked goods, coffee and a variety of ice cream flavors, some of which are made in the shop. The shop also has gluten- and dairy-free options.


 


“I’m still in disbelief that it happened, it’s crazy that it actually came to be.”- Victoria Wagner, UGA sophomore and store managerOwner Robyn Thompson said they decided to put the shop on Baxter Street so it can be a place not only for families, but also a place for college and high school students to come socialize and study.“We thought this was a happy medium to downtown, which is so college-centered, and is still accessible to families and also so close to the dorms and the high school,” Thompson said. “We wanted to pull it out of the chaos of downtown, and thought this would be a little more tranquil.”Thompson said another reason behind picking the location was the accessible parking for customers.

“I know it can be a hassle to pay for parking downtown and walk and all that,” Thompson said. “I wanted people to be able to come here without having to worry about that. I’m a mom, I know how much of a hassle it can be getting kids around downtown, and I know college kids don’t always want to pay to park just to go study.”


 


Athens is the second location for Four Fat Cows. The original location is in Alpharetta, Georgia.

Thompson said they decided to open a shop in Athens after a former employee and current University of Georgia sophomore Victoria Wagner said she thought Athens would be a great place for them to expand.“We have a girl who’s worked for us there for about two-and-a-half years and she’s going to school here now who was like, ‘I think Athens could really use one,’” Thompson said. “So she agreed to work, and that blossomed into this really big conversation and we decided if she would run it and be the manager then we could do it.”Wagner, a marketing major, said she had the idea after the idea of expansion was brought up during a staff meeting.“I just thought Athens would be the perfect location, with college kids, and obviously college kids love thing things like ice cream and a place to study,” Wagner said. “I’m still in disbelief that it happened, it’s crazy that it actually came to be.”Along with serving ice cream, Thompson said the name Four Fat Cows was inspired by her four children.One of her sons, Brenden Higbee, has helped his mom open the first and second locations of the shop as well as some of her other restaurant projects.

Higbee, a senior business major at Emory University, said after going to college, he realized how much he had enjoyed working with his mom on opening restaurants.“I think for both of us, we just kind of feed off of the chaos that comes with opening and working in restaurants. So long as there’s a problem, there’s something for us to fix,” Higbee said. “I’m sure two weeks from now, we’ll feel like everything is a little too quiet.”

Sometimes I feel like it is neglected, but I have always felt like if you don’t know where you have been, it is hard to find out where you are going.”- Vince Dooley, former UGA football coach“I love history and I think it is extremely important. Sometimes I feel like it is neglected, but I have always felt like if you don’t know where you have been, it is hard to find out where you are going,” Dooley said. The preservation efforts, announced Monday, include not only the preservation of the Revolutionary War battlefield of Kettle Creek, but also the newest loop trail addition to War Hill that was recently constructed. This trail will include benches and markers to engage trail-walkers.Preserving these battlefields is not just important to Dooley, but to the Civil War Trust’s initiative as a whole.“Battlefields don't get preserved everyday, particularly Revolutionary War battlefields,"" said Clint Schemmer, communications manager for the Civil War Trust. ""This is a very evocative battlefield ... An opportunity for the public to participate with music and free food and everyone welcome, those are unusual things.""


 


For the Trust, preserving battlefields means either acquiring a piece of property or putting the land under a conservation easement. This means that the land owner gives up rights to develop the property and put structures on it, Schemmer said.

The Trust’s initiatives to preserve battlefields are supported by local representatives.Hice plays an important role in the preservation of these battlefields as the representative supporting this initiative. Dooley has met with Hice and thanked him for his continuous support of battlefield preservation before and looks forward to thanking him for this continued effort on Monday.“If we didn't have the support from [local representatives], then there is no way to start saving these battlefields,” Dooley said.As an advocate for telling the stories of history, Dooley recently published a nonfiction book.This book, “The Legions Fighting Bulldog: The Civil War Correspondence of William Gaston Delony, Lieutenant Colonel of Cobb's Georgia Legion Cavalry, and Rosa Delony,” focuses on a Civil War soldier and his wife from Athens, and references letters between this couple from the University of Georgia archives to tell the story of this relationship.Additionally, at this event on Feb. 12, Camden Military Academy's Fife and Drum Corps will travel from South Carolina and to perform Revolutionary War-era music in colonial attire at this news conference.

Following this performance and the preservation announcement, a historian will lead a public tour at 3 p.m. traveling down a recently developed trail on War Hill. Food will also be available for attendees.“[Battlefields] are outdoor classrooms and they need to be interpreted,” Dooley said. “These are hallowed grounds where so many gave their lives fighting for a cause and it is extremely important to preserve these because otherwise they will just be eaten up by sprawl and that is how the Civil War Trust got started 30 years ago.”",Maggie Holland | Campus News Editor,athensnews,https://www.redandblack.com/athensnews/vince-dooley-rep-jody-hice-announce-american-battlefield-preservation/article_f1c83234-0ed2-11e8-871d-8b2af15193b7.html
12-Feb-18,'Big hearts be bold' fundraiser brings together Athens community,"The energy in the Classic Center theatre resounded through the crowd as 60 participants took to the stage on Saturday, Feb. 10, for the 11th annual “Big Hearts Be Bold” fundraiser, a special needs talent show hosted by Extra Special People.Founded in 1986, ESP is an organization that provides opportunities for individuals with disabilities by creating a place that they and their families can grow and create memories together. The organization has continued to grow every year since it started.“Big Hearts,” a show that first took place 11 years ago in a high school auditorium with less than 200 in attendance, slowly grew into one of the biggest events in Athens, selling out the 2,000 seats of the Classic Center theatre a week before the show.


 


Prior to the start of the show, a “Believe beyond limitations” chant erupted throughout the crowd.“ESP is my lifesaver. If we didn’t have it, I don’t know what we would do,” said Cheryl Jordan, mother of ESP member and “Big Hearts” participant Thomas Jordan. “He was one of the first participants 11 years ago. He just loves it.”

The participants, ages ranging from 6 to 40 years old, seem to have similar feelings towards the event.“My favorite part was all of it,” said Stephanie Connelly, a 35-year-old first-time participant who performed a Zumba dance routine.Talents ranging from flag twirling to breakdancing entertained the audience throughout the 3-hour show.More than 600 volunteers and sponsors helped run the show.“Working with ESP is so incredibly rewarding. Building these relationships with the participants here tonight is invaluable,” volunteer Courtney Lee said.


 


A few instances of participant stage fright were recovered as audience members chimed in with words of encouragement and applause.UGA football players Jake Fromm, Lorenzo Carter, Jordan McKinney, David Bellamy and Tyler Simmons joined the list of escorts for the pageant, along with former players Aaron and Josh Murray, who served as Masters of Ceremony.The money raised from the event will go toward programs that offer after school care, weekend outings and eight weeks of summer camp for more than 300 individuals involved in ESP.In addition, funds will benefit family support and counseling as well as community involvement to allow the public to engage with and support the ESP mission through special events and volunteer opportunities throughout the year.",Wellsley Kesel | Contributor,athensnews,https://www.redandblack.com/athensnews/big-hearts-be-bold-fundraiser-brings-together-athens-community/article_506c3d56-0fac-11e8-82fc-5ffed65f5a18.html
12-Feb-18,Review: Four Fat Cows is more than just great ice cream,"Four Fat Cows is Athens' newest stop for ice cream and much more. The store, located at 723 Baxter St., celebrated its grand opening on Saturday, Feb. 10. The Red & Black tried out Athens’ latest ice cream shop, and here are our thoughts:Four Fat Cows is much more than just your typical grab-and-go ice cream shop, because once you walk in, you’ll never want to leave, whether you are an ice cream fan or not.


 


Though college students do love ice cream, the one thing that they love more than ice cream is having an experience. Let’s face it, we don’t go to coffee shops and expensive restaurants just because we love the food — we go because we love the way the place makes us feel. It’s those “chill” vibes we get from those cute little coffee shops or the “home-sweet-home” feel in those southern comfort-food restaurants that keeps college students coming back for more.The ice cream shops in Athens have always just been a grab and go kind of place, where you get your ice cream, maybe find somewhere to sit inside or outside for a little, and then head on your way. It’s always been just about the ice cream — not the experience. But Four Fat Cows is here to change that.

Right when you walk in, you are immediately immersed into their culture, whether it’s through a genuine greeting from an employee, the upbeat and chill music, or just the lovely setup of the shop. You’ll notice an immediate shift in your mood, in that somehow the shop finds the perfect balance between the typical childlike candy store and the hipster coffee shops you find downtown. The environment is extremely inviting with its interior design and has a cute sitting space, which looks like a great place to hang out or study.No matter how dedicated you may think you are to a certain flavor, the amount of enticing flavors will have you in an indecisive frenzy. The shop does an excellent job of making sure there are enough of the classic favorites like cookie dough, brownie batter, vanilla bean and chocolate, but also includes some more striking flavors like red velvet swirl, green tea, almond joy, apple tart, rice pudding and coffee almond fudge. So even if you think that you are a stickler for the originals, Four Fat Cows may have you questioning your devotion.I knew I was going to be breaking my post-Christmas diet right when I saw their puffle cone option, which is essentially a freshly made waffle folded up into a cone shape. They make the puffle cone right as you put in your order, so that it will be nice and fresh when you devour it. As I let my teeth sink into the cone, I was pleasantly surprised to find how soft the puffle cone was while managing to hold three scoops of ice cream along with hot caramel sauce and Reese’s cups.

Initially, I was worried that the puffle cone might be one of those desserts that are so sweet it hurts to eat it. However, I was pleasantly surprised once again. The puffle cone itself had a more subtle sweetness to it rather than an overwhelmingly sharp sugary taste, which worked as the perfect complement to the ice cream.


 


In my cone was one scoop of red velvet swirl, one scoop of cookie dough, and one scoop of caramel turtle — probably the sweetest combination you can get. Even considering that, the sugar never felt like it was way too much.If you had to ask me which of the three was my favorite, that would be like asking me to choose a favorite child. Even so, I can’t help but giving a round of applause to the caramel turtle. This wasn’t just your average caramel turtle with a vanilla ice cream base and a few swirls of caramel and drops of turtle chocolates here and there. The whole ice cream base was a caramel flavor that was rich in flavor, but again not overloaded with sugar. And thankfully, there was no skimping out on chocolate pieces or caramel swirls whatsoever.

Even if you don’t consider yourself a huge ice cream fan, then there are plenty of other irresistible options that will lure you into Four Fat Cows. The shop also features a large variety of bakery items, from chicken, cheddar and bacon calzones to peanut butter and jelly cupcakes to gluten-free potato chip caramel cookies. There are also multiple creative coffee options along with other fancy coffee shop-like drinks, again making it an ideal place for students to sit down and study.While the ice cream and set-up are all impressive, that’s not what left such a lasting impression on me. It was the welcoming environment and culture of the shop that left me knowing I would be back again. The employees aren’t just worried about getting you in and out the door — they actually engage with you. The owner isn’t there just to make sure she gets her daily profit. She is there to get to know your name and make sure that you love this place just as much as she does.The fact of the matter is that if all you want is ice cream, then you can just drive to the nearest gas station. But if you want an experience, memories with friends or just somewhere that will cheer you up, then it seems that Four Fat Cows is the new place to be.",Lara Strydom | Contributor,culture,https://www.redandblack.com/culture/review-four-fat-cows-is-more-than-just-great-ice/article_9bfbe8da-0f9c-11e8-8681-7b9aec7c3fb7.html
12-Feb-18,7 traditional foods to help celebrate Mardi Gras,"Mardi Gras in Athens is drastically different from Mardi Gras in New Orleans, Louisiana. There most likely will not be a huge parade that fills West Broad Street, and there will probably be a disappointing lack of people tossing colorful beads and cups into a crowd of Athenians.However, Mardi Gras still exists as a culture-rich tradition and the last day of dietary freedom before Lent for the Catholic population.If you’ve never celebrated Mardi Gras before and want to this year, or you’re a Louisiana native thirsting for some of those traditional foods from back home, these seven foods will put a smile on your face the day before Ash Wednesday.


 


1. King CakeThis delicious and traditional cake is a staple for the Mardi Gras season. A round cake covered with glaze and purple, green and gold sugar (purple represents justice, green for faith and gold being representative of power), the king cake also typically hosts a baby Jesus figure inside the cake, and whoever receives the piece of cake with the figurine in it will have a stroke of good luck. However, in New Orleans, it’s customary for the lucky person to buy or make a king cake for the next gathering.Jamie Madsen, a sophomore from Woodstock whose mother is from Louisiana, shared some fond memories of Mardi Gras.“We do eat a lot of king cake,” she said. “My dog was chewing on something one day and he was chewing on one of the baby Jesus’ [from the king cake,]”Martinique Edwards, a fourth year who has a Bachelor’s degree as well as a masters in environmental health, also has roots in Louisiana.“My mom’s side of the family, they’re from New Orleans,” she said, “Every now and then, my family members ship over a king cake from New Orleans.”Though Mardi Gras is both a religious and a culture event, for Madsen’s family, it’s more a celebration of culture and family roots.“I think for my family, Mardi Gras is more cultural [than religious],” Madsen said.


 


Since Fat Tuesday is the day before Lent, Madsen had some advice for others.“Eat a lot of food and enjoy your last day of freedom before Lent,” she said.2. Crawfish ÉtoufféeThough significantly harder to find in Athens, crawfish étouffée is a very traditional dish in Cajun and Creole cuisine. It’s a thick, seasoned stew-type meal which is then served over white rice. The bell peppers, onion and crawfish give it its signature, warm flavor which the flour and butter allow it to reach an ideal consistency.Although Athens doesn’t offer much in terms of Creole food, New Orleans Online has a simple recipe for anyone craving some Louisiana comfort food.3. Dirty RiceDirty rice is another staple common to New Orleans, although some might be scared away due to one ingredient: chicken liver.Although the liver is typically seen as a staple ingredient, dirty rice can be made without it. The rice itself is cooked in chicken and beef stock, giving it an incredible flavor and making it dark in appearance, hence the name “dirty rice.”

4. Po’ BoyIf you’re looking for an easier New Orleans meal to make, the po’ boy might be your best bet. The traditional sandwich uses a baguette for the bread and usually contains either beef or various types of fried seafood, most commonly shrimp or oysters and is complemented by lettuce, tomato and usually mayonnaise or a flavorful alternative, remoulade sauce.For Edwards, the po’ boy is a staple and is best in Louisiana.“If we were down in New Orleans [this year], we’d probably be eating po’ boys and red beans and rice,” Edwards said.5. JambalayaWith both French and Spanish influence, jambalaya is a popular dish in Louisiana that combines rice with meat and the “holy trinity,” that is, bell peppers, onions and celery.While some might confuse jambalaya with another dish of rice and meat, gumbo, the two are significantly different.If you’re looking to have an adventure in the kitchen, The Darling Gourmet boasts the “BEST New Orleans Jambalaya, which calls for Andouille sausage, chicken, shrimp, spices and of course, vegetables.”

Madsen said that there’s usually a lot of good home cooking during the season of Mardi Gras.“My mom [normally] cooks rice, chicken and sausage,” she said.6. Crawfish BoilThough a crawfish boil is more of a social event and not necessarily a typical dish you would make at home for kicks, they could still be used for smaller events, say, a Mardi Gras party.In fact, Alton Brown has a delectable recipe that can yield 10-12 servings. If you’re not up to cooking a large meal and would rather go for a day trip, Big Easy Grille in Atlanta is hosting its 16th annual Mardi Gras Crawfish Boil on Saturday, Feb. 10, and will feature live music, lots of beads, beer specials and “general debauchery.”7. PancakesProbably one of the easiest items to make, pancakes are essential this time of year because Pancake Day is actually on Feb. 13, the same day as Mardi Gras.In order to make your pancakes more festive, all you need to do is add a few drops of food coloring in various bowls of batter so you can have green, purple and yellow pancakes. It’s as easy as that.",Madeline Laguaite | Staff Writer,culture,https://www.redandblack.com/culture/traditional-foods-to-help-celebrate-mardi-gras/article_8cfa166e-0f9b-11e8-a621-cbfc53e1684f.html
13-Feb-18,ACC Library hosts Black History Month exhibit,"In honor of Black History Month, the Athens-Clarke County Library will be hosting a month-long exhibit, “Georgia’s Great ... African Americans of Historic Distinction.”The exhibit is to chronicle several men and women as a way of adding to the narrative of the African American experience in a statewide, national and international context.The first African American jockey to win the Kentucky Derby, the first to be elected to the Georgia General Assembly since Reconstruction and the first to graduate from West Point will be among the many featured at the event.


 


“Though this exhibit, viewers will witness the boundless range of Georgia’s cultural and historical diversity,” the ACC library’s press release said. “Meanwhile, [viewers will] gain a greater understanding and appreciation of the rich multicultural inheritance that belongs to all Georgians, as well as a clearer understanding of the full spectrum of the American story.”The purpose of the exhibit, in part, is to preserve African American cultural heritage. By educating the community about the history of those involved with government, politics, business and activism, the individuals who constructed the exhibit hope to create an open dialogue.“Too often the story of these barrier-breaking achievers has been cast in the shadows and certainly not recorded in the history books or showcased in other media,” said Eleanor Kinlaw-Ross, the director of the Heritage Project and curator of the exhibit.This exhibit is the first installment of a series sponsored by the Heritage Project.Since 1985, this organization has produced different events and celebrations to “educate, enlighten and entertain audiences about the various facets of history and culture that have shaped the image and narrative of the African American experience and the the African Diaspora,” the press release said.The exhibit is set to be displayed throughout the entire month of February at the Athens-Clarke County Library, located off of Baxter Street.“The objective of the exhibit is to further the preservation of the African American cultural heritage, highlight those events and institutions that shaped the African American experience in Georgia,” Kinlaw-Ross said.",Kaley Lefevre | City News Editor,athensnews,https://www.redandblack.com/athensnews/acc-library-hosts-black-history-month-exhibit/article_4b0d9b1c-106e-11e8-93c2-533becf4e394.html
14-Feb-18,BREAKING: Houston Gaines announces 2018 campaign for District 117,"Houston Gaines has announced his candidacy for the Georgia House District 117 seat in 2018.In a post on his website, the UGA graduate and former Student Government Association president said he will run in 2018 and has named his leadership committee with representation from Clarke, Oconee, Barrow and Jackson counties.“This district wants and deserves conservative leadership at the state Capitol – and that’s not what it’s getting now,” Gaines said in his statement. ""I’m going to provide our district a conservative alternative to the out-of-touch representation we have today.""


 


District 117 includes parts of Athens and Clarke County, as well as parts of Oconee, Barrow and Jackson counties.Gaines, a Republican and recent University of Georgia graduate, lost the often-conservative district in a surprising upset to Democrat Deborah Gonzalez in a special election in November 2017, after former representative Regina Quick resigned her seat to become a judge.""I’m going to provide our district a conservative alternative to the out-of-touch representation we have today."" - Houston Gaines In his statement, Gaines addresses his loss last year and the ""narrow 450-margin"" between he and Gonzalez.""Special elections are – as evidenced by their name – unique,” he said in the statement. ""The dynamics in 2018 will be inherently different, as will our campaign. That’s why we are announcing today, in early February, almost nine months from Election Day.""


 


Gaines, backed by Atlanta GOP members, had a few political gaffes during the election last year. Mayor Nancy Denson, a Democrat, also received heavy backlash after supporting Gaines, her former campaign manager. As for the vote, a transportation SPLOST vote in Clarke County likely contributed to drawing more to the polls than usual.While promoting his campaign's stance, Gaines also took jabs at Gonzalez, calling her ""committed to the far-left ideologies that mirror the most radical wing of the Democrat Party"" and objecting to her ""inflammatory and divisive statements attacking law enforcement"" and her support for sanctuary cities.""Those aren’t the values of District 117, and those left-wing policies do not represent the heart of District 117,"" he said in the statement.Gaines raised nearly $200,000 during his special election run last year, and still has almost $100,000 in unspent funds, according to Flagpole Magazine.Members of his leadership committee include local area commissioners and school board representatives, Jackson County Sheriff Janis Magnum and leaders of the Jackson County GOP, Tammy Gilland, vice president of the Athens Regional Foundation and former UGA football coach and athletic director Vince Dooley and his wife Barbara.",Nate Harris | Lead Enterprise Reporter,athensnews,https://www.redandblack.com/athensnews/breaking-houston-gaines-announces-campaign-for-district/article_b5542da8-11a7-11e8-89db-5f4b82bc8362.html
15-Feb-18,SEC men's basketball power rankings: Georgia falls behind,"The Red & Black’s men’s basketball beat writers examine the current landscape of the SEC using results prior to Wednesday, Feb. 14.Tier One: Leaders in the clubhouseAuburn, Tennessee


 


Auburn is the cream of the crop in the SEC this year. The Tigers have the best record in the SEC and have gone 11-1 in their last 12 conference games. Led by Bryce Brown, Mustapha Heron and Jared Harper, Auburn has the makings of a prominent NCAA tournament team. Tennessee, on the other hand, is not too far behind. The Volunteers have arguably the most impressive non-conference win with a victory over No. 6 Purdue to go along with impressive SEC wins over Texas A&M and Kentucky. — Michael HebertTier Two: Lurking contendersFlorida, Missouri, Texas A&MThe Gators have had some ups and downs this season and recently went on a 1-3 stretch with losses to Georgia, South Carolina and Alabama. But Florida has still shown enough to be a contender in the SEC. Missouri is as hot as any team in the nation right now, having won five in a row and the Tigers still cling to the hopes of getting top recruit Michael Porter Jr. back at some point. Texas A&M started conference play 0-5 but has rebounded and cracked the top-25 in the latest Associated Press Poll. — Collin HuguleyTier Three: Talented but inconsistentAlabama, Arkansas, KentuckyAlabama has racked up great wins this season against Tennessee, Auburn, Florida and Oklahoma but also has some puzzling losses. Collin Sexton and the Crimson Tide are still in a solid position at 8-5 in SEC play. Led by the senior guard tandem of Daryl Macon and Jaylen Barford, Arkansas can hang with any team when its shots are falling. Kentucky lost three games in a row for the first time in the John Calipari era but still has enough blue-chip talent to remain dangerous in the SEC. — Collin HuguleyTier Four: Outside looking in


 


Mississippi State, LSU, GeorgiaMississippi State has wins over Missouri and Alabama and seems to be in decent position, but a weak non-conference schedule sets it back. LSU has beaten Texas A&M twice but inconsistency keeps them from moving up any further. Georgia is on a bit of a slide and is in danger of not only missing the NCAA tournament but also having a losing record going into the conference tournament. — Michael HebertTier Five: Bottom feedersSouth Carolina, Ole Miss, VanderbiltSince a Jan. 24 road win against Florida, South Carolina has gone into free fall with six consecutive losses. The Gamecocks looked like a potential team to make a second-half run after wins over the Gators and Kentucky but the wheels have fallen off. Ole Miss has also lost six straight and head coach Andy Kennedy announced that he would not return as head coach next season. Vanderbilt has occupied the last-place slot in the SEC standings for most of the season thus far. — Collin Huguley",Staff Reports,sports,https://www.redandblack.com/sports/mens_basketball/sec-men-s-basketball-power-rankings-georgia-falls-behind/article_5d1869da-11e6-11e8-a86e-63963f8def8c.html
16-Feb-18,Poll: 90 percent of voters support work-for-welfare,"A government accountability group says Congress should look into work requirements for able-bodied people on food stamps.In a paper released Thursday, the nonprofit Foundation for Government Accountability says Washington needs to put serious consideration into requiring parents receiving food stamps to either work, train or volunteer on a part-time basis. Currently, 52 percent of able-bodied parents who receive food stamps don’t work. That’s according to the Department of Agriculture.The public agrees. In a January poll conducted for FGA, 90 percent of voters polled think the able-bodied should have some sort of work requirement.


 


“We’re encouraged to see the public so supportive of these requirements,” said Jonathan Ingram, FGA vice president of research. “Republicans, Democrats, Independents across all demographics support able-bodied adults from welfare to work.”The poll showed 83 percent of voters supported a work requirement for food stamps.Illinois’ food stamp enrollment would fall by 317,800 people if the state was to place a work requirement on able-bodied parents to receive food stamps, the report said. It would see an estimated decline of 272,500 if the state excluded parents of infants in that requirement, still saving taxpayers more than $459 million annually.Via the Illinois Department of Human Services, Gov. Bruce Rauner’s office acquired a waiver for non-working adults to receive food stamps, saying there were places in Illinois without enough jobs to support the work requirement. According to DHS, 174,000 Illinoisans will remain eligible for the benefit for 2018 that otherwise wouldn’t have.",By Cole Lauterbach | Watchdog.org,news,https://www.redandblack.com/news/national/poll-percent-of-voters-support-work-for-welfare/article_49cf5684-f499-593b-9068-99d30c1fcda1.html
16-Feb-18,GymDogs fall to No. 5 Florida for fourth loss of the season,"The No. 14 Georgia gymnastics team fell to No. 5 Florida in Friday’s meet at Stegeman Coliseum by a score of 196.525-196.125. The Gymdogs fall to a 3-4 overall record and 3-3 in the Southeastern Conference with the loss. In the meet’s first rotation, the Bulldogs headed to the vault, while the Gators competed bars. Junior Sydney Snead highlighted the event for the Bulldogs, scoring a season-high 9.9 on the event. Meanwhile on bars, Florida’s Alex McMurty, who is No. 5 on the event nationally, tied a season-high 9.975.


 


It was a difficult night on the bars for the GymDogs. Back-to-back falls by freshmen Marissa Oakley and Emily Schild coupled with shaky dismounts made for a lackluster performance on the event. The 48.475 score marked the lowest score on any event for the team since the first meet against Alabama on Jan. 12. Schild competed in her first meet for the Bulldogs, as she has been building back from an injury. Succumbing to nerves and making errors, Schild shorted her dismount and both hands hit the mat.“It was just a freshman mistake,” head coach Courtney Kupets Carter said. “The pressure and the energy that gets to you. I don’t think she’ll be doing that again, and we will just have to take those hits now and work on the consistency later.”Senior Natalie Vaculik scored the team’s highest mark on the event with a 9.850. She said that there was pressure because the team knew that Florida would be a big meet, and they faltered to the pressure.“We’ve been doing really well in practice, so we have to figure out the way to translate that over into the meet,” Vaculik said. “We have had good meets on bars, and its consistently been one of our better events, so we need to figure out what went wrong and how to handle that pressure.” After the bars rotation, the GymDogs met in the huddle and Kupets Carter reminded her team that the meet was not over and wouldn’t be over until sophomore Sabrina Vega finished her floor routine. A solid performance on the beam brought the team back heading into the final rotation.Saving their best event for last, the Bulldogs emerged on the event with a newfound energy and seeming confidence and displayed the scores that Bulldog fans are used to seeing.On the floor exercise, Snead had a perfect performance, earning her first career 10.0. Stuck landings and explosive power to earn the first perfect score her team has seen this season.  


 


Prior to starting her routine, she stood on the sidelines cheering next to her teammates, feeling her energy and the floor team’s confidence building with each passing routine. “I think Jasmine started it off,” Snead said. “She went out there and hit an incredible floor routine, and it built from there. The floor team went out there aggressive and it was just fun.”",Brittany Stewart | Contributor,sports,https://www.redandblack.com/sports/gymnastics/gymdogs-fall-to-no-florida-for-fourth-loss-of-the/article_7cda9c44-1389-11e8-88c3-af38bd701a82.html
17-Feb-18,"Missed free throws, close shots plague MU in loss at LSU","They call them free throws for a reason, and Missouri’s men’s basketball team has often thrived shooting the shots from the line that sits 15 feet away from the hoop in this 2017-18 season.It did not Saturday.Against LSU, a team that won its previous three conference games at the Pete Maravich Center in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, Missouri shot 7 of 17 from the charity stripe. The black-and-gold Tigers fell 64-63, ending their five-game win streak.


 


“Tough loss,” Cuonzo Martin said in a postgame interview on the Tiger Radio Network. “This loss was tough. We didn’t play good basketball.”Missouri (18-9, 8-6 SEC), a team that shot 75 percent from the foul line leading into Saturday’s matinee showdown, had a chance to win the game against LSU (15-11, 6-8) down the stretch.With five seconds remaining and Missouri playing defense down a point, freshman forward Jontay Porter, who finished with nine points, tipped an inbounds pass. Senior guard Kassius Robertson recovered the ball and attempted a floater. The ball clanked around the rim, bounced off, and junior guard Cullen VanLeer attempted a putback.It was off.“We’re normally a good free-throw shooting team,” Martin said, “and (with all of the misses Saturday) we paid for it.”There were 19 lead changes and 13 ties in a game that came down to the wire. Senior guard Jordan Barnett, who finished with a team-high 18 points, buried five 3-point buckets in the second half to keep Missouri in it.On the other side, LSU guard Tremont Waters — a terrific talent at 5-foot-11 — willed his team at every opportunity. The freshman scored a game-high 21 points, including a pivotal go-ahead floater over Porter and off of the glass with 19 seconds remaining in the game.The shot proved to be the difference.


 


After the game, Martin said he was upset with his team’s opening 10 minutes. Late in the first half, inside the team huddle, LSU coach Will Wade was upset, too.“You can’t leave No. 3,” he yelled, referencing Missouri senior guard Kassius Robertson. “You can’t leave him. He’s killing us.”Indeed, Robertson was.The player who leads all graduate transfers in high-major college basketball in scoring (16.6 points per game) torched the purple-and-gold Tigers from deep after going scoreless in the first 10 minutes.With 4 minutes, 21 seconds remaining in the first stanza, Robertson, who finished with 14 points, drilled back-to-back 3-pointers. The first came on the left wing after a nice dish from VanLeer. The second came on the right wing.The jumpers gave Missouri a 30-26 lead, but the play of Waters brought LSU back. By the end of the first half, LSU led 36-33.Missouri shot 6 of 7 from 3-point range in the first half (86 percent) and 12 of 21 for the game. Ultimately, though — with the 41 percent free-throw shooting and 37 percent shooting from inside the arc (10 of 27) — it was not enough.Next up for Missouri is a matchup Tuesday at Mizzou Arena against Ole Miss. Martin is not worried about free-throw shooting or the many missed opportunities from in close going forward, nor is he worried his team will be ready to respond.

18-Feb-18,MU baseball can't complete sweep of Florida International,"Habitually leaving men on base eventually came back to haunt the Missouri baseball team on Sunday.The Tigers (2-1) stranded at least nine men on base for the third time in a three-game series, and fell to Florida International (1-2) by a score of 11-5 in Miami.Missouri won Friday night’s game 3-1 with two runs on two wild pitches in the top of the ninth and coasted to a win on Saturday by a score of 22-1. On Saturday, the Tigers left 10 men on base, but it hardly mattered when they brought twice as many around to score.


 


But Sunday’s loss to FIU featured an inconsistent Missouri offense that scored all five of its runs in the fifth inning. The Tigers put runners on base in five other innings, but failed to score them.After Zach Hanna’s three-run double broke a 2-2 tie, Missouri’s pitching collapsed in the bottom of the fifth, possibly due in part to the long layoff for senior starter Andy Toelken while his offense exploded in the top of the frame.The right-hander Toelken hit Jose Garcia with a pitch to start the fifth, then surrendered a two-run home run to Eddie Silva to make it 5-4. Toelken exited after following up the long ball by allowing a single to Kobe Lopez. Reliever Cody Siebenberger, a redshirt sophomore who transferred to Jefferson College, took over.Siebenberger hit Austin Shenton with a pitch, and both runners moved over on a sacrifice bunt. Christian Khawam’s two-run double gave the Panthers the lead, and they never gave it back.Missouri came up short in the sixth, seventh and eighth innings before FIU put the game out of reach in the bottom of the eighth. Freshman Konnor Ash inherited three runners on base from redshirt junior Cameron Dulle, then walked Shenton to force in a run.Then Diandre Amion tripled to right-center, clearing the bases, and came home on the play on a throwing error. In the span of two batters, FIU stretched its one-run lead into a thick 11-5 cushion, staving off any hopes of a Missouri comeback.For the Tigers, the struggles of their young bullpen were hardly unexpected. Newcomers Ash and Siebenberger, as well as the redshirt junior Dulle, combined to allow six earned runs in 3.2 innings. Even the senior Toelken allowed six hits and five runs, all earned, in four innings. Junior-college transfer Nile Ball was Missouri’s most effective pitcher, hurling 2.2 scoreless innings and striking out four batters.A lack of control exhibited by Missouri pitching may not have lost the Tigers the game, but it certainly didn’t help. Toelken plunked three batters, Ball hit two and Siebenbergerdrilled another. Missouri’s last three relievers — Dulle, Ash and senior Nolan Gromacki — each walked one batter. Toelken and Ball each threw a wild pitch.


 


Despite a loss in the finale, Missouri still heads out of Miami with a series win on the road. The Tigers will have two days off before a road tilt at 5 p.m. Wednesday against Miami (FL) in Coral Gables, Florida.Supervising editor is Jason Lowenthal: sports@columbiamissourian.com, 882-5730.",By Theo DeRosa,sports,https://www.redandblack.com/sports/national/mu-baseball-can-t-complete-sweep-of-florida-international/article_c2109ea7-1d64-57f3-bcfa-0e8473cc80c2.html

19-Feb-18,New York story blasts Mizzou basketball recruiting tactics,"Missouri made a big splash last spring with its basketball recruiting, but count the New York Post’s Phil Mushnick among those who are unimpressed.In fact he takes it a lot deeper in a recent lengthy column detailing some of the ills of the sports world, questioning Mizzou’s ethics.He writes, in part:


 


“This big college basketball scandal with Adidas payola money, the FBI sting that made big news and still does? But influence peddling — flat-out payola to land the best ‘student-athletes’ — occurs, unhidden, in plain sight.“In April, Missouri signed the nation’s No. 1 high school recruit, 6-foot-10 swingman Michael Porter Jr. ... Why Missouri? Funny you should ask.“The school hired his father as an assistant coach. And unless Porter Sr. is working for free, how can any logical human — or shrub — not conclude Missouri paid off Senior to deliver Junior?“Any college president with an active sense of fundamental right from wrong would have told Missouri coach Cuonzo Martin, ‘Oh, no you don’t. We don’t buy teenagers.’“You think this would pass muster in Missouri Law School’s ethics classes? ... And how does the NCAA allow this? I don’t know, but it always has.”","By Dan Caesar

19-Feb-18,UGA's Phi Kappa Tau reinstated after year-long suspension,"After a year of suspension, University of Georgia’s fraternity Phi Kappa Tau has been reinstated.Nick Parker, president of the Beta Xi chapter, confirmed that the suspension had been lifted as of Feb. 4.""We spent the past year, primarily as UGA students, but also reflecting and learning from our mistakes that brought us to the suspension of our chapter and charter,” said Parker in the official statement. “We have returned with almost 80 active members, strong alumni advisory boards and resumed recruitment.”


 


The chapter was suspended last year after a hazing incident involved the consumption of alcohol by underaged associate members in the fraternity’s house.According to the informal resolution agreement signed on Feb. 27, 2017, Phi Kappa Tau violated four University Conduct Regulations, including “providing, distributing, selling or facilitating the use or possession of alcoholic beverages except as permitted by law,” partaking in “conduct that threatens or endangers the health or safety of another person,” “participating in, condoning, encouraging, requiring or allowing opportunity for hazing,” and knowingly violating university conduct regulations.According to the agreement, on the date of the incident, the chapter “provided alcohol to new members who were under the legal drinking age,” during a required gathering.As a result of the suspension, the fraternity covered its Greek letters on the front of its house on West Broad Street. Since the suspension period is over, the cover has been removed.During the suspension period, fraternity members “present and participating in hazing activities” were instructed to have their status changed to “alumnus, voluntary withdrawal or expelled,” per instructions from the Phi Kappa Tau National Fraternity, the agreement said.Before re-registering this year, the national fraternity conducted an assessment of each individual who was hoping to be a member when the chapter was reinstated.Before hosting or sponsoring any events that include alcohol, all members are required to attend a risk management workshop focussed on alcohol, drugs and hazing.Parker’s statement said the chapter has since completed all requirements of the one-year suspension.


 


Though reinstated, the chapter will be on probation until Dec. 15, 2019, the agreement said. Any code of conduct violations between now and that date will “likely result in further suspension” or possible expulsion.",Ashley Soriano | Staff Writer and Nate Harris | Lead Enterprise Reporter,uganews,https://www.redandblack.com/uganews/uga-s-phi-kappa-tau-reinstated-after-year-long-suspension/article_deefd28c-15aa-11e8-999c-c358862c614f.html
19-Feb-18,LSU at home Tuesday looking for win over Vandy,"The LSU Tigers, coming off a last minute 64-63 win over Missouri on Saturday afternoon before a lively crowd at the Pete Maravich Assembly Center, looks to make it five home straight Baton Rouge wins when it hosts Vanderbilt Tuesday night at 8 p.m.The game is set for telecast on the SEC Network with Dave Neal and Daymeon Fishback on the call. Chris Blair and former head coach John Brady will have the call on the affiliates of the LSU Sports Radio Network (Eagle98.1 FM in Baton Rouge).Tickets for the game are available during the day Tuesday at the LSU Athletics Ticket Office and online at LSUTix.net. Tickets will be on sale at the upper concourse ticket windows at the Maravich Center beginning at 6:30 p.m. LSU students are admitted free of charge with valid student ID. The popular duo, Quick Change, will be the halftime entertainment.


 


LSU enters the last two weeks of the season at 15-11 and 6-8 in the Southeastern Conference, in a tie for ninth with Georgia and Ole Miss, while Vanderbilt is 11-16 and tied with South Carolina for 12th in the league.The Tigers are two games out of the four-way tie for third place and on the other extreme in the league, just two games out of 14th place. LSU needs just one win to guarantee a winning record for the regular season with 16 wins after winning just two games a year ago.The Commodores beat the Tigers, 77-71, in the first meeting at Memorial Gymnasium in Nashville back on Jan. 20. In the game, Vandy had a 16-point lead with 16:54 to go in the second half before LSU rallied to take the lead with 2:21 to play. But Vandy answered down the stretch and LSU could not stay with them in the end.Duop Reath led LSU with 31 points and 13 rebounds, while Skylar Mays was the only other Tiger in double figures with 13. Riley LaChance had 26 points and Jeff Roberson had 20 as Vandy shot over 50 percent. Bryce Drew is in his second year as head coach at Vanderbilt. He was born in Baton Rouge at the time his father, Homer, was an assistant coach for then LSU first-year coach Dale Brown in the mid-1970s.Coach Will Wade met with the media prior to practice on Monday and here are some of his comments:Opening Statement …“We are getting ready for Vandy. They were more aggressive than us in the first game. That really hurt us. They shot 30 free throws, we shot 21. They made 20, we made 13. We were 13-of-21, they were 20-of-30. They were much more aggressive than us getting in the paint. Obviously (Jeff) Roberson is a major issue for us. A versatile four man that can shoot, pass, score in the post. Roberson and (Riley) LaChance had 46 of their 77 against us the first time. They clubbed us pretty good. We are going to need to play quite a bit better to give a chance this next time here. Hopefully we will play more aggressive and drive the ball and get to the foul line a little bit better than we did the first time against them.”On what they did poorly against LaChance last time they played …


 


“We let him get to his right hand and drive us. We gave up an offensive rebound three. We lost him on a shake action three on a throwback where we over helped in on their five man rolling. We fouled him a couple times late on a ball-screen turndown. We fouled him and he hit two free throws. We did a poor job of having awareness on him. He is a very good player. It is not like we are the only team that they have scored 40 or 50 plus on. They did the same thing to Florida the other night, Roberson and LaChance. I didn’t think we put enough pressure on him. I didn’t think we were aggressive enough against him offensively or defensively. He is like Tre (Tremont Waters), when you let someone like him play at his own speed, they are going to be very effective, which he was the first game. Then Saben Lee came in and closed the game down for them. He did a great job driving us to the front of the rim.”On Daryl Edwards giving the team energy …“He just brings energy, toughness, and a winning mindset that we need. I think that is probably accurate. I don’t want to speak for all the guys, but I feel better when he is out there.”On if he recruited Edwards before LSU …“I recruited him when I was at Tennessee-Chattanooga. I have known him for a long time. I have known him since he was in high school in Charlotte. He went to high school, then prep school, then two years at junior college. He is an old cat. He has been around. I have known him for a long time.”On if Vanderbilt’s struggles on the road effects how they defend them …“No. They had Kentucky beat. They played about as well as anybody at Auburn. Auburn could never close them out or put them away. I don’t think them playing on the road or them playing here has any effect on how we are going to play them. They have played well on the road. They just haven’t gotten the results. Let’s hope it doesn’t start tomorrow.”On being successful on their home court …


TNCMS.AdManager.render({region: 'fixed-big-ad-bottom-asset', slot: 1, fold: ""below""});


“You should always own your home court, especially in league play. We haven’t done as good a job as we have needed to, but I think we have picked that up as of late. We are playing better at home. I think our guys are playing with a little bit more confidence at home. We changed up our routine. We changed some things up and I think that has contributed playing better and playing well.”On keeping the players focused after a big win …“We will see. I showed them the film yesterday. We made plenty of mistakes. It’s not like we were unbelievably attentive to every detail or played phenomenally. We still have a lot of things that we need to improve on if we are going to have a strong end of the season here. I think we will be ready to go. I wouldn’t see any reason why we wouldn’t be.”On the fans coming out and supporting the team …“I think they appreciate that the guys play hard. We are kind of duct tapped together a little bit right now. They are trying. They are trying really hard. Hopefully we can make our fans respect that.”On what he hopes to accomplish the rest of the season …“I wish we could be more consistent. That is what has hurt us. We wouldn’t need any of these conversations if we were a little more consistent. That doesn’t mean we are going to win every night. I would like to have a little consistency and jump off the roller coaster, and be straight line. That would be phenomenal. I think that would be good. That would help towards the other stuff too.”",Courtesy: LSU Athletics,sports,https://www.redandblack.com/sports/national/lsu-at-home-tuesday-looking-for-win-over-vandy/article_ec6c348b-f8ef-5500-bcac-43923fcdb016.html
19-Feb-18,Travis Scott breaks silence since becoming father,"Travis Scott has broken his silence since welcoming his first child with Kylie Jenner.The 20-year-old reality star and the 'Butterfly Effect' rapper - whose real name is Jacques Webster - welcomed their daughter Stormi Webster into the world on February 1, and now Travis has spoken for the first time about his newborn daughter.He simply told TMZ: 'She's beautiful.""


 


It comes after the pair seemingly marked their little girl's birth with matching tattoos.The dual inking reportedly took place when the couple went out on their first date night since becoming parents, and neither of them have yet told anyone what their new body art is of.A source told The Sun newspaper: ""It was actually the first time they've been out on a date night since Kylie had Stormi. They went to a tattoo artist and got secret matching tattoo tributes to their daughter. They haven't told people what they got. Kylie organised it as a surprise and Travis loved it.""The 'Keeping Up with the Kardashians' star and Travis, 25, already have matching butterfly tattoos, which they got last June.Previously, a source claimed the loved-up couple have become even closer since Stormi was born.They said: ""Her relationship with Travis has made huge strides since having baby Stormi, and they are back in a good place.""Travis has been staying overnight at Kylie's several times a week when he is not working or out of town and has also been giving Kylie her time to bond with the baby alone.""And it was also previously reported that Travis - who recently pleaded guilty to disorderly conduct over an incident at a concert in Arkansas last May - has become a changed man since becoming a father.


 


A friend of the musician said that he is ""laughing a lot, and much calmer than usual"".A source previously said: ""Kylie and Travis are a good team. Travis is able to do his own thing during the day as well, but he helps Kylie out at night. He has cut down on work and only has a few shows coming up.""",By Celebretainment,lifestyles,https://www.redandblack.com/lifestyles/entertainment/travis-scott-breaks-silence-since-becoming-father/article_56aeed6a-1df5-5e18-a39a-494e25a30293.html
19-Feb-18,Justin Theroux and Jennifer Aniston had separate properties,"Justin Theroux and Jennifer Aniston kept their properties separate when they married.The former couple announced last week they were splitting after over two years of marriage, and it seems dividing their assets will be a fairly straightforward matter.According to property records obtained by The Blast, Jennifer, 49, and 46-year-old Justin kept the deeds to their residences in their own names and as their ""sole and separate property.""


 


In the eyes of the law, property acquired as a couple becomes community property but as the 'Cake' actress already owned her 1965 Bel Air mansion - where she and Justin tied the knot - and her two-bedroom Hollywood Hills property, and the 'Leftovers' star had his New York apartment in Greenwich village before they wed, and the deeds were never altered, it won't be an issue.When it comes to finances, both stars had made most of their money before they got together, with Jennifer's hefty pay day from 'Friends' and Justin's work on 'Tropic Thunder' secured and not up for grabs during any potential settlement deals.It was previously revealed the pair had signed an ""ironclad"" prenuptial agreement before they tied the knot.A source said: ""Jennifer has an ironclad prenup with Justin. It would be very hard for Justin to contest it. The prenup talks before the marriage were long and intense""Jen's assets and 'Friends' fortune are protected.""In a joint statement, the former couple vowed to remain ""best friends"" who will continue to stay amicable, even though they are separating.They said: ""In an effort to reduce any further speculation, we have decided to announce our separation. This decision was mutual and lovingly made at the end of last year. We are two best friends who have decided to part ways as a couple, but look forward to continuing our cherished friendship.""Normally we would do this privately, but given that the gossip industry cannot resist an opportunity to speculate and invent, we wanted to convey the truth directly. Whatever else is printed about us that is not directly from us, is someone else's fictional narrative. Above all, we are determined to maintain the deep respect and love that we have for one another.""

20-Feb-18,Martin wants Mizzou to recapture unselfish play,"COLUMBIA, MO. • If it didn’t say MIZZOU splashed across the players’ black jerseys, Cuonzo Martin might not have recognized the team on the court Saturday at the Pete Maravich Assembly Center. At least not for the first 10 minutes or so.In a deeper, more balanced Southeastern Conference, Martin’s Tigers were probably bound to lose eventually, but he was troubled by his team’s play early in the 64-63 loss at Louisiana State, especially on the offensive end. The crisp ball movement wasn’t there. The selfless decision-making was absent. Neither team pulled away from the other, but Martin’s Tigers got away from the script that directed their five-game winning streak.Leading scorer and graduate senior Kassius Robertson, the team’s elder statesman and in-house expert on the pulse of the locker room, said Mizzou played “selfishly.”


 


With two days to reflect on the outcome, Martin didn’t disagree with that assessment“More than anything it’s moving the ball well offensively the first five, 10 minutes,” he said Monday, “sharing the basketball, making the right plays.”The Tigers (18-9, 8-6 SEC) have four regular-season games left to recapture the style that propelled them near the top of the conference standings. With last place Ole Miss (11-16, 4-10) visiting Mizzou Arena for Tuesday’s 8 p.m. tipoff, the Tigers are in a four-way jam for third place, still with a strong chance for a top-four finish and a double bye in the SEC tournament. Multiple projections have Martin’s team entrenched in the NCAA Tournament — ESPN.com and CBSSports.com both have Mizzou as a No. 7 seed in the bracket — but the Tigers can polish their credentials the next two weeks against a favorable schedule. Among the top eight teams in the SEC, the Tigers play the lightest schedule, facing four teams with a collective league record of 24-32.• MIZZOU TALK: Sound off about the 2017-18 season• EYE ON THE TIGERS: Dave Matter's Mizzou blogOle Miss visits Columbia on a seven-game losing streak and now without its longtime coach. Andy Kennedy announced last week he’d step down at season’s end but instead decided Sunday to leave the Rebels immediately. Assistant coach Tony Madlock will coach the Rebels at Mizzou Arena, marking the first time in 12 years Kennedy won’t be on the Ole Miss sideline.“A.K.’s a great guy,” Madlock said Monday. “He’s taught me so much and given me the opportunity to work under him. He told me to be myself and let my instincts take over. It’s a tough situation, but hey, it’s what we’ve been dealt and we’ll deal with it.”Martin doesn’t expect any curveballs from the Rebels under Madlock, a career assistant who’s spent the last four seasons in Oxford.


 


• PODCAST: Dave Matter in 'Eye On The Tigers' “They have the blueprint,” Martin said. “Tony’s been around Andy for a long time. He knows what he’s doing. He’s been in this game for quite a while. He’s battle tested. And he knows his team, so it’s not like they’re bringing in a coach who doesn’t know the personnel. He understands that.”As for his team, Martin’s Tigers have built their NCAA profile behind sturdy defense and efficient, unselfish offense. They got away from that blueprint Saturday. Mizzou didn’t record its first assist until more than 10 minutes had come off the clock and during a six-minute stretch missed nine of 11 shots. For the season the Tigers have averaged an assist on 57 percent of their field goals, which ranks No. 73 among all Division I teams and third in the SEC. In the first half Saturday, that average was down to just 33.3 percent.• SCHEDULE/RESULTS: 2017-18 Mizzou basketball• STANDINGS: SEC basketballIt didn’t help that freshman center Jeremiah Tilmon had his worst offensive game of the season. Tilmon had been sick heading into the game — Martin said he was dehydrated — but still managed to log 22 minutes on the court, when he wasn’t chugging water on the sideline. For just the third time all season he didn’t connect on a field goal attempt, finishing 0 for 6 with only a free throw and one rebound.“LSU won the game, but I give Jeremiah credit for getting out there and trying to play in that game,” Martin said. “He battled through it and came up short. He’ll be ready to go (Tuesday) night.”With four games left before postseason play tips off, Martin believes Saturday’s loss can reset the course the Tigers had mapped before Saturday’s setback.

21-Feb-18,Ashton Kutcher ends fight against baldness,"Ashton Kutcher took medication in a bid to prevent going bald.The 40-year-old actor - who has two children, Wyatt, three, and Dimitri, 14 months, with wife Mila Kunis - started worrying about losing his hair when he was just 25 years old, but quit the treatment five years ago and has now accepted his receding hairline.He admitted: ""I've gone off of anything to retain my hair. I started getting very concerned when I was 25, and that's when I went on the Avodart. And I think like, five years ago I stopped and I did really good for a year, and now it's thinning out.""


 


And the former 'That 70s Show' star insisted he is ""comfortable"" with losing his locks now he is a married father.Speaking to pal Dax Shepard on his new podcast 'Armchair Expert', he added: ""I've actually become comfortable with it. I'm just good with it. I've got kids now.""And Dax - who has Lincoln, four, and Delta, three, with wife Kristen Bell - admitted he had also sought treatment to preserve his locks.He said: ""I had heard that there was this doctor that would give you hair as thick as Brad Pitt's, and I was going to this guy and I was doing it for two years and I was like, 'What am I doing?' I think we both went to this doctor.""Meanwhile, Ashton - who was previously married to Demi Moore - admitted he has never been a big drug user but did experiment with various illicit substances when he was in high school.He said: ""When I was in high school and college, I smoked weed some and did mushrooms and tried acid and did some various things that were expansive for me at the time.""So, I did a ton of that fun stuff when I was younger. And then when I went to college, I was like, 'I'm done.' I think that I smoked weed like one time when I was in college, and then after I dropped out and moved to Los Angeles.""And so I didn't do drugs. I had entered into a pretty long run of sobriety from drugs, and I didn't really drink that much. If we went out during the weekends, I would drink, but I always kind of had a school night rule.

21-Feb-18,Tigers go belly up at home against lowly Ole Miss,"COLUMBIA, MO. • A road loss against an occasionally potent Louisiana State team is one thing.A home loss to last-place Ole Miss and its lame duck interim coach is another.In Missouri’s first chance to cleanse its palate from Saturday’s one-point defeat at LSU, Cuonzo Martin’s team put a damper on its postseason profile with Tuesday’s 90-87 overtime loss to the Rebels at Mizzou Arena.


 


Rarely looking like the team that ran off a five-game winning streak earlier this month, the Tigers threw the ball out of bounds. They missed free throws. They left shooters alone on the perimeter. In the paint, they played something only slightly reminiscent of defense.The Tigers were especially foul on the foul line, where they missed five free throws in overtime and 11 for the night. With a chance to clinch a .500 record in conference play, Mizzou (18-10, 8-7 Southeastern Conference) expended so much energy to rally from a 13-point deficit, by the time Ole Miss forced the extra session, Cuonzo Martin’s team could only collapse further. Mizzou turned the ball over 21 times overall and missed all eight of its field goal attempts in overtime.In both regulation and overtime, the Tigers treated the home crowd to one of their signature meltdowns, first blowing a five-point lead with 1:46 left in the second half.“We couldn’t close out the game,” senior guard Jordan Barnett said. “Turnovers down the stretch. Same old, same old.”“It’s inexcusable,” junior forward Kevin Puryear said. “A lack of focus, lack of toughness. It’s embarrassing actually to have 21 turnovers on your home floor.”• BOX SCORE: Ole Miss 90, Mizzou 87 (OT)• MIZZOU TALK: Fans sound off about Tigers' poor effortPuryear’s steal with 13 seconds left gave the Tigers life when it seemed the Rebels (12-16, 5-10) had all but secured their first SEC road win. Jordan Geist raced the length of the floor and attacked the rim but couldn’t connect or draw a foul. Instead, Markel Crawford grabbed the rebound, got fouled and sank two foul shots to extend the Rebel lead to three with five seconds left.


 


Martin later said he would have preferred Geist collect himself in the lane for a layup or a pass back to the perimeter.“One thing we talk about if you get it in there like that, jump stop,” Martin said. “If you have a clean layup, take the layup. If not jump stop and the action is behind you. Again, he’s going fast like there was an opportunity to score and probably just didn’t do the jump stop.”After Crawford’s free throws with five seconds left, Martin called for a play that springs Kassius Robertson open from a Jordan Barnett screen, but Geist kept the ball and had to settle for a contested 3 that fell short at the final buzzer. It wasn’t the first time Geist held the ball on a deciding possession in a loss this season, similar to past missed chances against Florida and Arkansas. The junior finished with 15 points, seven rebounds and four assists but also had a game-high six turnovers.Geist “had to take that shot,” Puryear said of the final attempt. “I’m not mad at him for it. He’s my teammate. That shot really didn’t determine the game at that point. We did things that could have contributed to the win. We just didn’t make winning plays down the stretch. To blame Geist would be a disservice to us all because we all did things that were uncharacteristic and we could have done things much better.”Especially from the foul line, where the normally straight-shooting Tigers shot 20 of 31 — just three days after shooting just 7 of 17 at LSU. MU’s ball-handling was no better as six different players turned it over at least twice. Martin called the turnover binge “mind-blowing.”“You see 21 turnovers and you look back and say, ‘How does that happen?’” he said. “It’s not as if (Ole Miss) was pressing or running and jumping all night.”• SEC STANDINGS: Mizzou in four-way tie for 5th placeTuesday’s game was Ole Miss’ first without longtime coach Andy Kennedy on the Rebels’ sideline. Kennedy, the dean of SEC coaches when the season began, announced earlier this month his 12th season at the school would be his last. On Sunday, he decided to leave the program immediately, putting assistant coach Tony Madlock in charge for the rest of the season.

Perhaps it was a coincidence, but the coaching change seemed to ignite some effort from the Rebels (11-17, 5-10) rarely seen during the seven-game losing streak they carried to Columbia.“Coach all week gave us the confidence to play loose and free,” Ole Miss guard Breein Tyree said, “and to just prove we’re not going to the bottom of the SEC.”Ole Miss scorched the nets early, making 6 of 13 3-pointers in the opening half and feasted on Mizzou turnovers. The Rebels turned nine first-half giveaways into 13 points and outscored MU in transition 8-0. By game’s end, Tyree finished with a game-high 25 points while Terence Davis added 19.Martin tried to warn his team the Rebels were more dangerous than their record indicated.“Whatever happened with the coaching staff that didn’t work out, they didn’t lack talent,” Martin said.Geist provided the rare highlight for the Tigers in the first half’s final minute, tossing a shot off the glass behind his back in traffic while getting fouled, good for a three-point play that got the Tigers within five. But Mizzou fell asleep on Ole Miss’ final possession, letting Dominik Olejniczak get inside for an easy basket in the paint for a 42-35 halftime lead.Ole Miss made four of its first five shots to open the second half and regained its double-digit lead as the Tigers continued to find ways to turn the ball over. Getting a rare chance for a transition basket, Barnett threw a pass two rows deep into the crowd. Geist twice lost the ball deep in the backcourt.Nine minutes into the half, Jontay Porter’s cross-court pass to Robertson for a 3-pointer got the Tigers within 58-53, later followed by a deep Robertson 3. But the Rebels always had an answer. Deandre Burnett settled the crowd with a 3 off the glass on the next possession, but Barnett erupted the arena again with a contested 3, slicing the Rebel lead to two heading into the 8-minute timeout.

Gradually, the Tigers started making the plays that put Ole Miss in front early. Jeremiah Tilmon chased down a loose ball into the stands. Geist followed a missed 3-pointer with a catch and rumble into traffic, earning two free throws.The Tigers finally captured the lead with 4:54 left on Geist’s 3-pointer then built a six-point lead on 3s from Barnett and Porter.With a minute to go and Mizzou up one, Robertson gave the ball away, but Barnett blocked Crawford’s layup.With a chance to take the lead, Tyree missed a jumper with 30 seconds left, and Geist went sprawling to corral the rebound. Fouled on the play, Geist gave the Tigers an 83-80 lead but couldn’t sink both foul shots with 12 seconds left, leaving the door open for Tyree’s game-tying floater at the end of regulation.“They hit us in the mouth,” Puyear said, “and we waited too long to hit them back.”With three regular-season games left, including the next two on the road, there could be help on the way. Tuesday’s game was Missouri’s last before Michael Porter Jr.’s much anticipated check-up with his spinal surgeon Thursday in Dallas. If things go well during Porter’s appointment, the freshman forward could be cleared for full-contact practices, though it’s uncertain if he’d be available to play immediately. The Tigers’ next game is Saturday at Kentucky. Porter’s only action in the regular season came in the opening minutes of MU’s Nov. 10 season opener against Iowa State. He underwent lower back surgery on Nov. 21, an injury Mizzou initially said would sideline him for three to four months and likely for the season.Whether it’s Saturday at Kentucky, next Tuesday at Vanderbilt or the March 3 home finale against Arkansas, the Tigers still need wins to secure their place in the NCAA Tournament. Another loss or two might require a win or two in next month’s SEC tournament in St. Louis. Tuesday’s loss dropped the Tigers into a four-way tie for fifth place in the conference.“We’ve endured some adversity already in SEC play, losing three in a row,” Puryear said. “We’re more than capable of streaking games together and playing at a high level. But we’ve got to get it together.”","By Dave Matter

21-Feb-18,MU baseball looks Sharp in win over No. 24 Miami,"In his first start on the mound as a Missouri Tiger, Brian Sharp lived up to his last name.The junior from Liberty, who typically does double duty at the plate and from the hill, pitched five effective innings and kept No. 24 Miami (FL) off the scoreboard as the Tigers (3-1) beat the Hurricanes (2-2) by a 9-0 final score Wednesday night.Sharp played in 100 games as a batter in his first two seasons at Missouri. In those two years, he made 28 relief appearances, pitching to an ERA of 4.29. He struck out 30 batters and walked 20 in 35.2 innings.


 


But on Wednesday night, at Alex Rodríguez Park at Mark Light Field, the Coral Gables, Florida, home of the No. 24 Hurricanes, Sharp didn’t walk a single batter. He threw 76 pitches, and 52 were strikes. Sharp struck out eight hitters and pitched out of considerable trouble twice to keep Miami scoreless.In the third, Miami redshirt senior designated hitter Michael Pérez lined a ball to center field with one out. It was a base hit, but Missouri sophomore center fielder Kameron Misner laid out to try to snag it. The ball hopped over Misner and rolled near the center-field wall. Pérez dug for third and made it to the bag.Sharp kept him there. He struck out freshman second baseman Willy Escala and got freshman shortstop Freddy Zamora to fly a ball out to center field to end the inning.After Sharp kept Miami off the board in the third, his offense backed him in the fourth.The Tigers’ first two runs came with one out in the inning when, with the bases loaded, freshman second baseman Mark Vierling lined a ball off the foot of Miami starter Michael Mediavilla. The left-hander picked it up and threw high to the plate. The throw glanced off the glove of the Hurricanes’ catcher and two runners came home.Senior catcher Brett Bond followed Vierling with a liner for an RBI-single, and senior third baseman Alex Samples dropped down a sacrifice bunt to score the fourth run of the inning. The fifth tally came in when sophomore shortstop Chris Cornelius ripped a single to score Bond.In the bottom of the inning, Sharp skated again. He put runners on the corners by allowing singles to Michael Burns, who led off the inning, and to Romy González with one out. Sharp rebounded to strike out a pair to end the inning and keep Miami off the board again.Sophomore left-hander T.J. Sikkema came into the game in relief of Sharp in the sixth. Sikkema, Missouri’s bullpen ace, struck out five in three innings of work while allowing just one hit.


 


Missouri padded the lead with four runs in the eighth. Three of the runs came on back-to-back-to-back bases-loaded walks to Cornelius, Samples and senior first baseman Matt Berler.Redshirt junior Cameron Dulle pitched a scoreless ninth to seal the game.For Missouri, Kameron Misner continued his hot streak with a 2-for-3 night featuring an RBI-double, two walks and one run scored. Misner has reached base in 17 of 22 plate appearances in 2018.Missouri has a day off before it begins the second half of its eight-game jaunt in the Sunshine State. The Tigers will take on Northeastern University in a four-game series, which opens at 5:30 p.m. Friday in Fort Myers.

21-Feb-18,"From angry to humbled last fall on the gridiron, LSU CB Kary Vincent motivated on the track","For so many, LSU’s loss to Troy last September was just that — one singular loss.It was one mark in the ""L"" column — a stunning loss, yes, but a result that still counted the same as any other defeat: One.For Kary Vincent, it was different. He lost two things: the game and his starting spot.


 


“At first I was confused,” said Vincent, a freshman defensive back from Port Arthur, Texas. “I would be lying to you if I said I wasn’t angry. I was very angry. But I’m really thankful for it. I understand it and appreciate the coaches for what they did. It made me a better football player.”

Vincent’s first season at LSU peaked early. He started three of his first four games, made all of his nine tackles last season before October and snatched a one-handed interception in Game 2. He was riding high, an 18-year-old starring as the primary nickel cornerback for, of all places, a Southeastern Conference program recognized as annually having the nation’s top DBs.His pick against UT-Chattanooga even crossed off a career goal five quarters into said career — landing on ""SportsCenter"" as a top play. So, what happened? How is it that he 1) never started again, 2) did not make another tackle, let alone an interception, and 3) completely missed games against Alabama and the bowl against Notre Dame?The reason — “complacency,” he says — isn’t as important as the motivation it has given him in a completely different sport. A Texas high school sprinting champion, Vincent has joined the LSU track team, juggling both sports like so many before him.The list includes Eddie Kennison, Xavier Carter, Trindon Holliday and Bennie Brazell, the latter in his eighth year as an LSU track assistant.On an unseasonably warm Tuesday afternoon, Brazell welcomed Vincent to track practice with a smile and joke ahead of the player’s interview with a reporter.


 


“Talk good about me!” a laughing Brazell told Vincent.This is a big week in the world of indoor track-and-field. Conference championships unfold this weekend.Vincent will participate in the 60-meter dash preliminaries at the SEC championships in College Station, Texas, on Saturday (3:20 p.m., SEC Network+), with a chance to advance to Sunday’s finals (5:11 p.m., SEC Network). He’s also hoping to post a good enough time to squeeze into the top 16 nationally. Those sprinters compete in the NCAA championships March 9-10, the final indoor meet before the outdoor season starts a week later.He’s got time to make up. Vincent’s best time this year — in his only race — is 6.74 seconds. That ranks 65th nationally, about a tenth of a second behind the current qualifying time (6.63). An outdoor runner who starred in high school at the 100- and 200-meter events, Vincent is new to running a 60-meter dash and new to performing any event on a hard indoor track.He has only practiced with the track team for about a month.“To run that with (that little) of the work he did, we can’t get our best sprinters to do that,” Brazell said. “He’s really special. His future is really bright.”LSU CBs coach Corey Raymond: Tigers moving WR Mannie Netherly to cornerbackOrgerons' new $900,000 home in Baton Rouge: Five bedrooms, lakeside, golf course view

The real focus, Shaver said, is preparing the 5-foot-10, 185-pounder for the outdoor season. Vincent will alternate between the sports once spring football practice begins March 11, something he has planned since high school. After all, he was not only ranked as high a the No. 2 cornerback in the 2017 signing class — he was the top-ranked prep 200-meter sprinter.Already, his schedule in February is loaded. He starts his weekday with a football weightlifting session (7:30-9 a.m.) before three hours of classes and a short lunch. He arrives to the track at 1 p.m. for treatment, sprints through an hour-long track practice before crossing back over Nicholson Drive to the football operations facility for meetings and a walkthrough from 4 p.m.-5:45 p.m.Brazell went through this himself — a “difficult task,” he says. Former LSU cornerback Donte Jackson is living proof. In 2016, Jackson’s two-sport spring ended in March because of academic missteps.

“It’s really hard to find that person who wants to do both. It’s not easy,” Shaver said. “But I’ll be honest: Every year we’ve ever won an NCAA championship in track on the men’s side, we couldn’t have won it without the football players.”Maybe Vincent is the next in that line of dual-sport champions, but he’s not the only two-sport guy on this year’s track team. Fellow football freshman Mannie Netherly, a receiver last year who is moving to cornerback, will compete in the outdoor season.Track is up Vincent's alley. Speed is in his genes. His father, Kary Vincent Sr., played receiver for Texas A&M and was drafted in the sixth round by the Saints. The younger Vincent claims to have never lost a race since his junior season in high school. It’s a reason LSU coaches began the season with him as their starting nickel cornerback last year.This season, the starting corner spot opposite Greedy Williams and the nickel position are up for grabs among Vincent, incoming signee Kelvin Joseph, sophomore Jontre Kirklin, Netherly and potentially Kristian Fulton.

Nickel is a position of importance this season. Defensive coordinator Dave Aranda expects to play more of the 2-4-5 package in 2018, he said in an interview earlier this month. That means finding a solid and consistent nickel, something he couldn’t last season.Vincent speaks like a player who knows he’s got an edge there.“Coach O is expecting me to fill a big cornerback position, but once it comes to the nickel, I’ll always fill in,” Vincent said. “I’m looking to pick up where I ended up last year. I’ll be back in those blitzing packages, covering those guys in the slot.”He held that job last season for a month before Jackson replaced him at nickel. It is something Brazell has not allowed him to forget.“If you were really good enough, if you were that good, you would have kept playing,” Brazell tells his sprinter.“I’m one of those coaches that’s straight up with him,” Brazell said. “I stay on him. I’m not going to BS him.”Neither does Corey Raymond, Vincent said. The LSU cornerbacks coach delivered him a message after trimming his playing time during the Troy game: “Get back on your game. You came in here hot and died down a little because you thought you just had it made.”

The lack of reps sparked the player, Vincent said, and now it’s bleeding over across the street to the track.“I had big goals for myself last year on the football field. I had things I wanted to accomplish, that I could have accomplished had I kept my mindset right,” Vincent said, “but I’m carrying it over to the track. I plan to be a freshman All-American and lead this team to some titles.”LSU DC Dave Aranda says Tigers' signing class restocked a pivotal area: the defensive frontDeep pockets: Tiger Athletic Foundation gives $23 million to LSU athletics in 2016, documents show",BY ROSS DELLENGER | rdellenger@theadvocate.com,sports,https://www.redandblack.com/sports/national/from-angry-to-humbled-last-fall-on-the-gridiron-lsu/article_48f52bf4-edc4-5286-b749-48025033a5cf.html
22-Feb-18,Georgia Senate Bill 339 could expand free speech zones on state campuses,"Did You Know? Georgia Senate Bill 339 was approved by the Senate Higher Education Committee on Feb. 20.  UGA President Jere Morehead spoke against this bill on Feb. 13.  The bill will now be up for review by the Georgia Senate. University of Georgia students are used to passing preachers on milk crates condemning their sins or pro-life organizations showing graphic images of aborted fetuses.These speakers, while offensive to some, are typical in the Tate Student Center Plaza or in front of Memorial Hall, UGA’s designated free speech zones.


 


On Tuesday, Feb. 20, the Georgia Senate Higher Education Committee approved a bill which would expand these free speech zones to any public area on campus and make the campus a traditional public forum open to anyone who wants to speak, regardless of their affiliation with the university.If this bill passes through the Senate, the University System of Georgia Board of Regents would have to develop and adopt a free expression policy outlined in Georgia Senate Bill 339 which would nullify any previous policies that contradict the bill.Currently, the UGA Freedom of Expression Policy states individuals not affiliated with the university must make a reservation request to reserve a time at one of these free speech zones, and these areas are the only areas at which people not affiliated with the university can speak.

The university community, on the other hand, is not required to reserve a time for the free speech zones. As for other publicly accessible areas on campus, the university community can reserve areas through the associate dean of students before the planned activity, and they can engage in spontaneous speech under certain regulations, though non-affiliated individuals cannot do so on campus.UGA President Jere Morehead spoke in favor of UGA’s current policy and against adopting this bill in a speech to the Senate committee on Feb. 13.“I have major concerns for this overbroad application of the First Amendment that could detract for the learning environment on college campuses in Georgia,” Morehead said.Effects of the bill


 


UGA student Erin Cooke said she expects the legislation to be received positively at UGA.“Across the nation and in Georgia, we have seen students be denied their First Amendment rights, and this bill is a good first attempt at addressing that,” she said.

Cooke is president and campus coordinator for UGA’s chapter of Turning Point USA, which is a nonprofit organization which aims to promote freedom, free markets and limited government, according to the website.“It’s great to see the Georgia legislature take an interest on the issue of campus speech,” Cooke said.The bill would allow all individuals, regardless of if they are affiliated with the university, to partake in expressive activity anywhere on campus as long as their speech is protected under the First Amendment and does not infringe on others’ rights. The speech will still be subject to content-neutral regulations such as noise restrictions.“The largest benefit of the legislation is the ban on so-called ‘free speech zones,’” Cooke said. “This means no longer will students be subject to unconstitutionally small areas of campus to express themselves.”The bill would also apply to faculty, giving professors the right to speak freely on campus and in classrooms about “public controversies of the day,” the bill reads.

Morehead said the traditional classroom setting could be disrupted by a faculty member’s “extreme, partisan political-charged commentary in their classrooms.”It’s great to see the Georgia legislature take an interest on the issue of campus speech.-Erin Cooke, president of UGA Chapter of Turning PointDr. William Lee, a communication law professor, said the bill would allow faculty to go “beyond our traditional concepts of academic freedom.”It would also require the USG Board of Regents to create a special subcommittee that will issue a yearly report of the administrative handling of free-speech to the public and state legislators.After several other amendments were revised, including a controversial portion which would impose heavy consequences on those who disrupted a speaker on campus, the legislation will be reviewed by the Senate, though there is no set date to debate the bill yet.

The bill’s beginningThe bill is sponsored by several Republican state senators and was sparked by the many, mostly conservative, speakers who have been run off campuses by demonstrations and protests across the nation.Senate Bill 339 is a product inspired by a 2017 model bill released by the Goldwater Institute, a public policy research and litigation organization that aims to expand U.S. freedoms.Lee said Georgia colleges in general aren’t free-speech friendly.The Foundation for Individual Rights in Education, an organization with a mission to “defend and sustain individual rights at America’s colleges and universities,” ranks U.S. colleges a red, yellow or green light based on their reception of free speech.All ranked public Georgia universities have either a red or yellow light.“One of the benefits of this law is that it would eliminate some of these policies that are in place at some of these schools that are problematic … It’s going to be a big step forward at most of these schools,” Lee said.

“Right now, going into spring, I look at Lloyd Cushenberry and Cole (Smith) battling,” Cregg said during an interview Thursday on ESPN 104.5 FM’s Off The Bench. “A true freshman playing center in college at a major top 5 institution, it could happen, but it could take a lot of reps. I like to see those two guys compete.”Smith, a 6-4, 280-pound Mississippi native, signed with LSU as a the eighth-ranked center prospect in the 2018 class. Cushenberry served as an immediate backup last season as a reshirt freshman, seeing some spot duty at guard and center.The Tigers begin spring practice March 11 with plenty of holes to fill on Cregg’s unit. Starters center Will Clapp and tackles Toby Weathersby and KJ Malone are gone. LSU returns tackle Saahdiq Charles and guards Ed Ingram and Garrett Brumfield.Charles is temporarily sidelined while recovering from shoulder surgery he underwent last month, something the sophomore announced on social media in January. He played with a banged-up shoulder during his freshman season in 2017. His status for spring is unclear, but normally coaches rest players in spring who undergo January surgery. From angry to humbled last fall on the gridiron, LSU CB Kary Vincent motivated on the trackThat leaves junior college transfer Badara Traore and redshirt sophomore Jakori Savage competing at the tackle positions, Cregg said.“They’re battling it out,” he said. “Obviously, Saahdiq is getting better. He’s going to treatment two times a day and working hard at it and trying to get back on the field. He’s actually trying to do a lot of the footwork stuff we’re trying to teach. He’s eager to come back. Couldn’t be more pleased with how the group is working overall.”Cregg is searching for the best five players to start on his line, and his current depth chart is ""etched in sand,"" he said. Another junior college transfer, Damien Lewis, could potentially get into the competition at center, he said. 


 


""He’s never snapped a ball before, but you never know. It could be taught and trained,"" Cregg said.

23-Feb-18,OPINION: UGA needs better reports on suicides,"Editor's NoteThe Red & Black publishes opinions from a number of contributors and staff columnists. Their opinions do not reflect the opinions of the editorial staff. The editorial staff is in no way involved with the opinion pieces published with the exception of editorials. Editorials are written by the editorial board consisting of the opinion editor, managing editor and editor-in-chief. Editorials are clearly marked EDITORIAL at the beginning. This article is from staff writer Anila Yoganathan, a sophomore journalism major minoring in Latin American and Caribbean studies.American society needs to discuss the existence of suicide within the United States, specifically among college students. Suicide is the tenth leading cause of death in the United States, and second leading cause of death among people ages 15-34. While colleges do try to promote more mental health programs to reduce the risk of suicide, the first steps to helping others should be to acknowledge the deaths of students who committed suicide and address the system’s failure to help them.However, some colleges don’t know the exact numbers of how many suicides occur on their campuses each year or how many suicides occur off campus to their current student body. Some colleges don’t keep records either consistently or at all. Without these records, universities deny the existence of suicides happening on their campuses or to their students and cannot effectively help students who are at risk.


 


The University of Michigan collected data on student suicides. This data allows the university to find trends to help its students, proving that collecting records of student suicides is effective in helping students gain access to the resources they need and increasing awareness among departments.The Associated Press recorded lists of universities and how they kept records of suicides. The University of Georgia was shown to either not keep statistics consistently or at all.UGA’s 2016 report details numbers for crimes and safety concerns collected from the UGA PD and the Athens Clarke County PD, with spots to report both on and off-campus suicides from 2014 to 2016. The report does not specify whether the numbers taken from ACC PD were solely about students or employees of UGA, or whether they included off-campus incidents, though there is a place or them in the tables. Specifying from where each of these numbers came is necessary for transparency between UGA and the public.While UGA is not required to report suicide numbers under the Clery Act, there is a section for suicides that displays zeros, which is false, as indicated by the death of UGA Student Lei Wang on Feb. 9, 2016.Wang, a UGA graduate student, was found dead on College Station and reports indicated that his death was self-inflicted. Wang’s suicide, which could have been handled by one or both of UGA PD or Athens Clarke County PD, is also not recorded on the 2016 table which includes on- and off-campus incidents.UGA’s yearly crime statistics tables that span from 2009 to 2016 also report zero suicides in any of those years. That describes seven years and zero reports of suicides on the UGA campuses and specified areas. UGA is not only not keeping records of the suicides happening on its campuses or to its students, but is also claiming that there have been none. This completely disregards the nature of the deaths of students like Wang and many others who have committed suicide.UGA needs to collect and truthfully publish its suicide records, so it can find ways to help students who are risk. By not doing this, the university is continuing to perpetuate the ideology that suicide should remain an unspoken topic, which does not solve the problem.",Anila Yoganathan | Staff Writer,opinion,https://www.redandblack.com/opinion/opinion-uga-needs-better-reports-on-suicides/article_6163d7b8-174f-11e8-93d3-fb34b17358d7.html
23-Feb-18,"Nobody's talking, but all signs point to Porter Jr.'s return for Mizzou's stretch run","COLUMBIA, MO. • The possibility that Michael Porter Jr. returns to the floor for the Missouri basketball team this season reportedly took another positive step Thursday. The Missouri freshman was “fully cleared” for all basketball activities, CBSSports college basketball writer and radio personality Jon Rothstein first reported, citing an anonymous source.Missouri declined to provide an update on Porter’s status Thursday. Tigers coach Cuonzo Martin is scheduled to meet with reporters Friday to discuss the situation. Asked about the report, Missouri team spokesman Patrick Crawford texted, “Coach Martin has media availability tomorrow (Friday) at noon.”Porter was scheduled to visit his spinal surgeon in Dallas on Thursday for a follow-up on his November surgery. Last week, Martin said Thursday’s doctor’s visit would determine if Porter was physically cleared to resume practicing with the team.


 


“We will know more after that meeting,” Martin said last Friday.Porter and his father, Missouri assistant coach Michael Porter Sr., were unavailable for comment Thursday.Porter, the country’s top-ranked high school recruit in 2017, hasn’t played since the opening minutes of Mizzou’s first game on Nov. 10 against Iowa State. He underwent lower back surgery on Nov. 21, a procedure called a microdiscectomy of the L3-L4 spinal discs, performed by Dallas spinal surgeon Andrew Dossett. Mizzou initially said the surgery would sideline Porter for three to four months and likely for the season.When he last met with reporters on Feb. 9, the projected NBA lottery pick said his back never felt better and he wanted to return this season if his doctor gave him clearance.“I’m just a kid who wants to play basketball,” Porter said two weeks ago. “I’m not thinking about the risks. If I could play today I would play today. I’m not worried about re-injury. What I’m worried about is it good for our team if I come back. Because if it was tournament time and they said I’m ready to go, is that the best thing for our team? We’re doing really well right now and I think people are losing sight of that.”• MIZZOU TALK: Sound off about the 2017-18 season• EYE ON THE TIGERS: Dave Matter's Mizzou blogAs Martin alluded to last week, being cleared for basketball activity doesn’t necessarily mean Porter will immediately return for games. Mizzou (18-10, 8-7 SEC) plays at Kentucky on Saturday, then goes back on the road Tuesday at Vanderbilt before finishing regular-season play at home March 3 against Arkansas.


 


“It’s one thing to say he (Porter) has cleared,” Martin said last week. “That means everything looks good. Now you have to go do it on the floor. It’s our job to make sure he is successful in doing that. There is no point in playing the guy if he gives you five minutes a game. He’s not built to play five minutes a game. The guy is a ballplayer. So you have to put him in positions so he can be successful. That’s why you go through practice situations. To feel it out. Put him in a lot of different scenarios. It will be heightened to another level come game time, because there is a scouting report. They still remember the caliber guy he is.”• SCHEDULE/RESULTS: 2017-18 Mizzou basketball• STANDINGS: SEC basketballMizzou enters the weekend in a six-way tie for third place in the SEC after dropping back-to-back games to Louisiana State and Ole Miss.

23-Feb-18,Mizzou's Porter Jr. returns to practice; Martin unsure when — or if — he'll appear in a game,"UPDATED, 2 p.m.COLUMBIA, MO. • Missouri freshman Michael Porter Jr. will return to practice Friday for the first time since undergoing back surgery in November but Tigers coach Cuonzo Martin is unsure when, or if, Porter will appear in a game this season.""He will get implemented in practice today and then we’ll go one day at a time,"" Martin said Friday at Mizzou Arena. ""I don’t really have a timetable after that. It's just one day at a time.


 


""At the end of the day the most important thing, as I’ve said before, is his well-being and health and to make sure he’s good to go. It’s one thing to be OK to start a practice. Then you have to go through it. Again, I couldn’t tell you when he’ll step on the floor (in a game), if he’ll step on the floor.""















        

        
        Eye on the Tigers podcast: After Ole Miss debacle, how does Mizzou make NCAA tournament?


Episode 22: Just how bad was the Missouri men's basketball team's overtime loss to Ole Miss? 




The Tigers (18-10, 8-7 SEC) have three regular-season games to play, starting with Saturday's 7 p.m. tipoff at Kentucky (19-9, 8-7). Both teams are among six locked into a six-way tie for third place in the conference. Martin said he hadn't thought about whether Porter will dress out for Saturday's game at Rupp Arena.Porter, the 6-10, five-star prospect, hasn't played in a game since MU's Nov. 10 opener against Iowa State and lasted less than three minutes before heading to the bench. He underwent surgery 11 days later. On Thursday, Porter visited his spinal surgeon in Dallas and was cleared to resume practicing. Asked if Porter will be limited in any kind of drills, Martin said, ""We will see once we go through it. I’ll start more non-contact (drills) up and down and see how that goes. Then we’ll progress from there.""""The most important thing I decide, the doctors and trainers decide, what’s best at the end of the day,"" he added. ""The health is a factor. To make sure he can go through the grinding and bumping. You’re talking about three-plus months (without playing).""I think the great thing about it is he’s healthy enough to be out there now. The next part is going through it. After that I couldn’t tell you anything about it until we go through (practices) and I’ll say, ‘He’s good to go,’ whatever that is, if it happens.""Porter wasn't made available for interviews Friday, but veteran teammates Kevin Puryear and Jordan Barnett welcomed the freshman's addition to practice, though with their focus centered on Saturday's rematch with Kentucky. The Tigers beat the Wildcats for the first time in 11 tries earlier this month.


 


""To have him on the floor would be a huge asset to our team,"" Puryear said. ""Everybody in this room knows what he brings to the table.""""We haven’t had him pretty much all season,"" Barnett said. ""To get him back practicing would be really nice, but all we can focus on right now is this road trip coming up right now and ultimately trying to get a victory.""As far as who decides when - or if - Porter plays in a game, Martin described the decision-making process as a collaboration. ""If he’s healthy enough to practice and go through it, bang up and down, run the floor, block out, fall down, take a charge, all those things, then I’ll decide between the doctors, trainers, (strength coach) Nicodemus (Christopher), ‘OK, we’re good? Then we’re good,'"" Martin said. ""He’s a competitive player. If you say, ‘Play tomorrow,’ he’s playing tomorrow. That’s just his nature. That’s one of the gifts he has. But it’s bigger than just him (saying), ‘I want to play.’ he has to be healthy enough to play, in my opinion.""Asked if Porter could be in uniform for Saturday's game, Martin cracked a smile. ""Maybe I should say he’s playing and we’ll get (Kentucky) off balanced,"" he said. ""I haven’t thought that far into it. Maybe. If it makes him feel good. Yeah, that’s fine if that happens. It could happen. But I haven’t thought about it to that point. That’s why my assistant coaches helps me out so much.""The Tigers were practiced Friday afternoon in Columbia then were scheduled to fly to Kentucky at 4 p.m. When Porter was first sidelined in November, Martin didn't have to change the offense, though the shots and points became more evenly distributed among the team's top scoring threats, like graduate senior Kassius Robertson, who emerged as an All-SEC candidate and the team's leading scorer, plus veterans Barnett and Puryear and freshmen forwards Jontay Porter and Jeremiah Tilmon. 


TNCMS.AdManager.render({region: 'fixed-big-ad-bottom-asset', slot: 1, fold: ""below""});


Martin doesn't sound worried about the offense readjusting to Porter's possible return. ""The thing with Mike is he can score the ball,"" Martin said. ""He can go inside-outside, so it’s not like he’s a big man who can only get it in the post. He can bring the ball up the floor. He can come off a ball screen. He can set a ball screen. He can shoot a 3-point shot. He’s not a guy you have to have a lot of plays for. Because he can make plays.""With a rebuilt roster headlined by the Porter brothers, plus Robertson's addition and four-star freshmen Tilmon and Blake Harris, Mizzou was picked fifth in the SEC preseason poll despite three straight last-place finishes. Though once Porter went under the knife his teammates believed those outside expectations faded. And that didn't sit well within the locker room.""The outside noise pissed us off a little bit,"" Puryear said Friday. ""The fact that people thought our season was over with after he got hurt, I think that really upset us. It's really more to prove everybody wrong. We know what we have in that locker room.""""As soon as he went down,"" Barnett added, ""we really had something to prove.""""We’re not going to deny it,"" Puryear continued. ""It pissed us all off. Of course, Michael is who is he is. He’s great teammate, a great player. But even he would tell you we have talented group of guys as well.""That became obvious during the summer, Puryear said, when the mix of holders overs and newcomers reported to Columbia. The upgrade in talent was clear across the board, with one obvious outlier. ""We were just going at it every single day,"" Puryear said. ""I’d say the only  person who was dominating every single day in practice was Michael, because he’s so dominant the way he scores and how dynamic he is.""

Now, after some midseason trimmings, the roster is down to eight available scholarship players - nine if a certain 6-10 freshman rejoins the rotation. Whether or not that happens, the Tigers' resolve hasn't gone unnoticed by their first-year coach.""I think our guys stepped in and what they’ve done up to this point is really impressive,"" Martin said, ""just to be able to deal with the outside noise of ‘You can’t do this. You can’t be that’ and to excel the way we have. ... To lose games we think we should have won and the pain in the guys, that’s the growth of the program. I’m proud of those type of things. In order to be a champion you have to go through your day to day life and it has to be built to be a champion. You don’t become that when you get there. You became that along the way. Those guys are showing great signs of that.""","By Dave Matter

23-Feb-18,Georgia gymnastics falls to No. 2 LSU,"The Georgia gymnastics team fell to No. 2 LSU in Stegeman Coliseum on Friday night 197.575-196.725.The GymDogs began the first two rotations with lackluster performances on vault and bars. On vault, four of five gymnasts scored less than a 9.8. Freshman Marissa Oakley highlighted the first half of the meet for the Bulldogs, scoring a 9.9 on bars and tying her career-best score.Head coach Courtney Kupets Carter pulled her team to a team huddle and gave them an enthusiastic pep talk between rotations. Oakley said that Kupets Carter told her team to loosen up a little bit in the final events.


 


“I think we were all a little tight and just holding back a little bit,” Oakley said. “It’s important, especially on beam because you can’t be too tight. You have to be relaxed in order to know that you can hit every time because we know we can.”Appearing to take Kupets Carter’s words to heart, the Bulldogs emerged with the confidence Bulldog fans are used to seeing on beam. It was a night of high score for three GymDogs on beam. Senior Vivi Babalis tied a career-high score of 9.9, while Oakley and sophomore Sabrina Vega scored career-highs on the event.Oakley highlighted the event and competed a nearly flawless routine punctuated by a stuck dismount for a career-high score of 9.95. Kupets Carter has previously said that beam is her team’s strongest event and said she was pleased to see improvements on the event from the entire lineup. “It’s going to keep getting better,” Kupets Carter said. “You saw awesome glimpses of absolute amazing, and so I’m excited for those glimpses to become permanent in the lineup.”  Sophomore Sabrina Vega, the anchor for the GymDogs on the event, carried on the tradition of the GymDog moonwalk in front of an electric Georgia crowd. She scored a career-high 9.925 on the event to send the Bulldogs into the final event for the evening.Vega said she attributes the team’s success in the event to the work that her coaches have put in during the practices from August to December.“There’s a different mindset going into beam this year,” Vega said. “It’s all strictly numbers and building confidence. You can see it on beam, it’s coming together a little more every meet.”


 


Moving into the final event, the Bulldogs trailed the Tigers by a little less than one point. Showing confidence and powerful tumbling on the event, Babalis tied her career high score with a 9.9 on the event. Vega and Dickson also showed nearly-perfect routines with 9.95s on the event for the Bulldogs, drawing the electric Georgia crowd into their performances.“We’ve been focusing on the little things,” Vega said. “We are focusing on the little details. Every meet we are getting better and getting more confident, and you can see the pieces slowly coming together.”",Brittany Stewart | Contributor,sports,https://www.redandblack.com/sports/gymnastics/georgia-gymnastics-falls-to-no-lsu/article_da8572c2-1908-11e8-bc2d-ef85d549ec81.html
24-Feb-18,Mizzou pregame: Tigers braced for return to Rupp,"LEXINGTON, KY. • Missouri has cashed in its momentum for a two-game losing streak and next takes the floor at Rupp Arena to play the suddenly resurgent Kentucky Wildcats in a crucial game for SEC seedings.In other words, it’s jaw-setting time.Huh?


 


Mizzou’s defensive play slipped in Tuesday’s overtime loss to Ole Miss. On Friday, while all the focus was on a freshman who hasn’t played in 106 days, Tigers coach Cuonzo Martin was asked if his defense can possibly duplicate its performance from its win over these same Kentucky Wildcats three weeks ago.“When you defend your defense travels,” he said. “We didn’t defend as well at home last game, but your defense, that’s who you are.“You set your jaw to do battle. Whatever happens happens.”Mizzou’s jaw was all glass the last two times it visited Rupp Arena. But this is a new team under a new coach with tangible goals within sight. But first, a quick history lesson to put Saturday’s 7 p.m. tipoff in perspective:Missouri has visited Rupp Arena three times since joining the SEC. The first time here was an overtime thriller, a 90-83 loss in 2013. Phil Pressey did Phil Pressey thing with 27 points and 10 assists. Willie Cauely-Stein swatted seven shots. That was the John Calipari Kentucky team that didn’t make the NCAA Tournament. Mizzou’s other two Rupp experiences in the SEC years came against UK juggernauts.On Jan. 13, 2015, UK blitzed the Tigers 86-37. Kim Anderson’s Tigers made one 3-pointer … and missed 17. The top-ranked and unbeaten Wildcats made three times as many free throws (24) and Mizzou attempted (eight). Cauley-Stein, Aaron Harrison and Karl-Anthony Towns outscored MU’s entire team 41-37. It was Mizzou’s lowest scoring game since 1959.“They played a buzzsaw today,” Calipari later said.On Jan. 27, 2016, UK dominated again, 88-54. Like the game a year earlier, Kentucky pulled away early with a 20-2 run and never looked back. The Cats blocked 11 shots, shot 45 percent from 3 and feasted on 15 Mizzou turnovers. “We played as well as we can play,” Calipari said. “We did it the entire time. That’s what I said to (Anderson) after: ‘Don’t judge this game because that’s as good as we are.’”


 


With that frightening trip down memory lane out of the way, the Tigers (18-10, 8-7) return to Rupp Saturday night with a far more competitive team, albeit on a two-game losing streak, a coach with better success against the Cats and a secret weapon on the bench. Martin wouldn’t rule out any possibility Friday but he indicated freshman forward Michael Porter Jr. won’t play in Lexington. But until it’s certain the rookie is keeping that surgically repaired lower back glued to the bench Saturday, the Wildcats will be left wondering if the five-star forward will be part of MU’s rotation.Otherwise, here are keys to the game …WILL KNOX PLAY (WELL)?Two players linked to the FBI probe in Friday’s Yahoo Sports story will sit out Saturday while their schools look into their connections to the federal investigation: Texas’ Eric Davis Jr. and San Diego State’s Malik Pope. Kentucky freshman Kevin Knox was mentioned in the report, too.The 6-9 forward is UK’s leading scorer. A friend of Porter’s from the AAU and high school all-star game circuit, Knox took an official visit to Mizzou last spring and considered the Tigers before heading to Lexington. He was mostly a non-factor against MU three weeks ago in Columbia as Cullen VanLeer helped hold him to just five points on six shots. In MU’s 69-60 win, the Cats shot just 2 of 20 from 3-point range, their second-worst single-game shooting day of the season. “We were just really good at staying in front of the ball in our half-court defense,” MU’s Jordan Barnett said Friday. “They really struggled getting points other than (scoring) off second chances. Our halfcourt defense, our man-to-man principles were really good. Hopefully we can get back to that.”UK is the SEC's worst 3-point shooting team (29.5 percent), which makes Knox's range all the more valuable. The last meeting was an outlier for Knox, a potent perimeter scorer who has eight double-figure games in his last nine. On Friday, Calipari said he expected Knox to play against the Tigers Saturday. UK announced Saturday morning that it didn't find any eligibility issues or rules violations  involving current players. If that means Knox plays, Mizzou needs another strong defensive showing on the 3-point arc — far better than what the Tigers showed in the first half Tuesday against Ole Miss.

CRASH THE GLASSMissouri plays at Vanderbilt on Tuesday, but first, the Tigers play the league’s most impressive Vanderbilt.Some of Calipari’s best teams haven’t always been the most polished offensive teams but they created their own scoring chances by crashing the offensive boards. His nine UK teams have always ranked among Division I’s top 100 teams for offensive rebound rate and more often than not are among the nation’s elite, like this year. The Cats are No. 5 nationally in grabbing their own misses at 36.1 percent. It’s the fifth time in nine years that Calipari’s had a top-12 team in that category.And nobody hits the offensive glass on this UK team better than 6-9 freshman Jarred Vanderbilt. In the 11 games he’s played, he’s grabbed 24.6 percent of possible offensive rebounds when he’s on the floor per kenpom.com. That number is preposterous. He hasn’t played enough games to qualify for the national or conference stat leaders, but consider the Division I leader for offensive rebound rate is Michigan State’s Nick Ward at 19.2. Jeremiah Tilmon is MU’s best and sixth among qualifying SEC players at 12.8.Vanderbilt hasn’t played more than 24 minutes in a game — he grabbed 10 boards in 16 minutes at Mizzou — but he’ll play a critical role in UK’s stretch drive toward March.Martin has praised the freshman as much as any opposing player this season — and even compared him to the one of game’s greatest rebounders of all time.“He’s a work horse,” Martin said. “He’s a skilled guy, but when he rebounds the ball he reminds me a lot of Dennis Rodman at the level he rebounds that ball. For him to be 19 with that frame and that size and athleticism, that quickness, that fight, that desire, it’s really hard to keep a guy like that off the offensive glass. He had six offensive rebounds against Arkansas (on Tuesday). We’ll have our work cut out trying to keep him off the glass … because his approach is relentless.”The Wildcats lost the first matchup because they couldn’t shoot. But they still managed 20 offensive rebounds in the loss.

HOW MUCH RUPP ADVANTAGE?Four of Martin’s eight rotation players are making their Rupp debuts Saturday: freshmen Tilmon and Jontay Porter, sophomore Reed Nikko and junior Jordan Geist.Barnett played at Rupp as a freshman at Texas, going scoreless in five minutes.Kassius Robertson played at Rupp last year as a junior for Canisius, scoring 16 points in a 24-point loss.VanLeer and Kevin Puryear were on the court as Mizzou freshmen two years ago when the Tigers lost here and combined for 17 points.As for Martin, he’s 0-3 at Rupp as a head coach, all with Tennessee, by margins of eight, 10 and 25 points.With Rupp’s capacity of 23,500, this figures to be one of the biggest crowds most of these players will ever experience in college. UK is 14-2 at home, spoiled only by two-point losses to Florida and Tennessee. Advantage Wildcats? Usually that’s the case, but …

24-Feb-18,"Bill Haisten: Even if March Madness is special, the 2017-18 season is ruined","College basketball 2017-18 is so filthy that NCAA enforcement personnel, for the time being, have become spectators.Since September, when Oklahoma State’s Lamont Evans was among four assistant coaches charged in a bribery and corruption investigation conducted by federal authorities, it has become publicly known that the FBI is on the front line of policing college basketball.Ultimately, can there be new and effective legislation and enforcement practices? Stain remover should be applied to two aspects of college basketball.


 


Problem No. 1: College programs must be prohibited from even the most casual association with the agents who arrange for athletes to sign with certain programs.Schools don’t directly pay recruits, but cheating coaches have relationships with representatives of agencies and shoe companies who preside over the summer basketball culture, interact with players on a frequent basis, influence decisions and distribute the money.If the NCAA wants a cleaner product, this would do it: There has to be legislation dictating that if a program is proven to have a relationship with such an agent, the consequences are tough. For the head coach, a one-year expulsion from college basketball.Even if an assistant coach is the guilty party in regard to direct contact with an agent, the head coach would be punished. So would the assistant, of course.For a second offense, a three-year expulsion for the head coach, scholarship reductions and a postseason ban.For a third offense, a school’s basketball program would get what SMU football got in 1987 — a death penalty. No competition for an entire season.Problem No. 2: This has more to do with the appeal of college basketball than with morality, but for the benefit of the NBA and the people who love college basketball, the one-and-done model must be discontinued.Currently, the NBA considers a player to be draft-eligible if he is no younger than 19. Elite players graduate from high school, spend one season on a college roster and then bolt for the NBA within hours of the end of their team’s season.


 


Greats like Ralph Sampson, Patrick Ewing and Tim Duncan played four seasons of college basketball. Michael Jordan was a North Carolina Tar Heel for three seasons.More recently, by the time a casual fan becomes familiar with stars like Kevin Durant and Anthony Davis, their freshman season is finished and they’re headed to professional basketball.Last year, 16 one-and-done players were selected during the first round of the NBA draft, but league Commissioner Adam Silver acknowledges that the one-and-done concept doesn’t work. The huge majority of guys at that age are not ready to help an NBA team.The sensible play for Silver would be to allow players to enter the NBA draft out of high school. A few might be picked and might stick with an NBA team. Some would be assigned to the NBA’s G-League and some would look for basketball jobs overseas, but at least there wouldn’t be the “student-athlete” pretense during a run of only a few months with a college program.In college football, athletes are not eligible for the NFL draft until they are three years removed from high school. The same rule should apply to basketball athletes who sign college letters of intent.With three seasons of college experience, more drafted players would be capable of thriving in professional basketball. In most cases, the NBA would get more value on money spent on first-year players.At the college level, the more pressing crisis is blatant cheating. For the moment, Arizona coach Sean Miller is the most talked-about figure in the sport.ESPN reported on Friday that FBI wiretaps captured the voice of Miller discussing a $100,000 payment that would be applied to the recruiting of 7-foot-1 Deandre Ayton. A year ago, Ayton was rated the No. 1 high school prospect in the country.


TNCMS.AdManager.render({region: 'fixed-big-ad-bottom-asset', slot: 1, fold: ""below""});


A sobering ESPN College GameDay segment included a strong statement from analyst Jay Bilas: “This is a career-ending thing for Sean Miller. I can’t imagine him ever coaching in college again.”As a result of ongoing investigations, Yahoo! Sports reports that Kansas, Duke, North Carolina, Texas, Kentucky and Michigan State are among schools whose rosters include players who might have committed significant violations.When schools pushed head-coaching pay into the millions of dollars, the pressure to win was intensified.When schools accept sponsorship money from shoe companies, it results in sketchy relationships and opportunities for impropriety. The FBI has uncovered several examples of impropriety.Only two weeks before Selection Sunday, there is far more talk about college basketball’s lawbreakers than what could be one of the more unpredictable and entertaining NCAA Tournaments ever played.Big-time college basketball has big-time problems. Even if March Madness is special, the 2017-18 season is ruined.","By Bill Haisten

25-Feb-18,Scientist of the Week: Kelly Dyer's love of evolution started with noticing 'things that are weird',"Looking around Kelly Dyer’s office, there is no doubt about what she does. Large pictures of flies, DNA molecules and a Darwin bobble head can only mean one thing -- evolutionary genetics.“We’re interested in understanding biodiversity. We’re interested in understanding how there are so many species out there,” Dyer said. “The two main things we study are how organisms adapt to their environment and the process of how one species splits into two.”Dyer’s research focuses broadly on the relationship between genetics, evolution and ecology. Her lab has a variety of projects looking at how ecologically important traits evolved through selection in the processes of adaptation and speciation.


 


“My Ph.D. adviser said to me, ‘Luck comes to the prepared mind.' I think a lot of it is being open to what your seeing and to notice things that are weird.” - Kelly Dyer, Associate genetics professorThe model for these experiments are done on drosophila, a genus of fruit fly. Drosophila work well as a model system because they have a short generation time, they are easy to rear in the lab, and they can be collected outside the lab.The broad research emphasis of Dyer’s lab allows them to work on many projects at the same time.

She is currently working in a collaborative project investigating the adaptation of drosophila to be resistant to the toxins in fungi that would be poisonous to humans. The project looks at how and why these flies evolved to be tolerant to these toxins.Dyer’s work with evolutionary genetics has implications with conservation, disease resistance, and biological control methods.


 


Originally from California, Dyer received her undergraduate degree from University of California, Davis. She then went on to receive her doctorate in evolutionary genetics at the University of Rochester.She began her career at the University of Georgia in late 2007 after working at the University of Edinburgh in Scotland as a Royal Society USA Research Fellow.Since that time she has been been filling her lab with students at the graduate and undergraduate level and working on several projects. Dyer said along with the research, she really enjoys teaching.Currently, Dyer teaches introductory genetics and received the Richard B. Russell Award for Excellence in Undergraduate Teaching in 2017.She is also very involved with public outreach, as shown by her going into middle and high school classrooms to teach students about herpetology and other aspects of biology.Dyer says she thinks public outreach is important, because it humanizes scientists and helps relate research to everyday life.She encourages young students entering the world for science to be curious and to follow that curiosity.“My Ph.D. adviser said to me ‘luck comes to the prepared mind,’” Dyer said. “I think a lot of it is being open to what your seeing and to notice things that are weird.”

25-Feb-18,Mizzou no match for Kentucky; Porter Jr. watches from bench,"LEXINGTON, KY. • It wasn’t the never-in-doubt mismatch that quickly unfolded the last two times Mizzou visited Rupp Arena, but with their season trending the wrong direction and their sputtering NCAA Tournament profile needing a late jumpstart, the Tigers didn’t exactly inspire confidence with Saturday’s 87-66 loss, their most lopsided defeat of the season.Mizzou’s last two visits here in 2015 and 2016 were never competitive, losses by 49 and 34 points, respectively. By that standard, this one was more evenly matched, but the Tigers rarely played with the same grit and polish from their 69-60 win over the same Wildcats three weeks earlier in Columbia.“What we lacked more than anything else was a level of toughness,” Mizzou coach Cuonzo Martin said. “In that department, they won the battle. They set a tone and made tough shots.”


 


It helped that Kentucky freshman forwards P.J. Washington (12 points, five rebounds) and Jared Vanderbilt (11 points, 15 rebounds) clearly outplayed Mizzou’s frontcourt tandem of freshman bigs as both Jeremiah Tilmon and Jontay Porter fouled out and combined for just nine points.Kentucky freshman forward Kevin Knox, a non-factor in UK’s loss at Mizzou three weeks ago, led six Wildcats in double figures with 21 points. UK’s 62.5 percent from 3-point range marked a season high.“Right before your eyes,” Kentucky coach John Calipari said, “we’re becoming a better basketball team.”Mizzou is officially trending the other direction. With their third straight loss, the Tigers (18-11, 8-8 SEC) fell back into a tie with Alabama for seventh place in the conference, while Kentucky (20-9, 9-7) stayed in the third-place logjam with Arkansas, Florida and Mississippi State. Projected as a No. 7 seed in the latest NCAA Tournament projections, Mizzou didn’t spoil its tourney credentials with Saturday’s loss but can’t continue to spiral, starting with Tuesday’s game at Vanderbilt.An hour before tipoff Saturday, it looked like the Tigers might get some much-needed help off the bench. Freshman forward Michael Porter Jr., out since having back surgery in November, returned to practice on Friday and took part in pregame shooting on Saturday, wearing the team’s official anthracite game jersey and a T-shirt, perhaps a signal he would make his much-anticipated return.But when the Tigers came out of the locker room for the last time before tipoff, Porter was back in sweats and back on the bench. It’s uncertain when — or if — he’ll play his next game. After Tuesday’s game in Nashville, MU closes the regular season next Saturday against Arkansas.“He was part of one practice (on Friday),” Martin said. “We only went for about 45 minutes. We weren’t doing a lot of contact stuff. He was part of the shootaround today. He’ll practice tomorrow (Sunday) at the level we’re practicing at. It won’t be a lot. Really, we wanted to make sure he was healthy from the standpoint of being able to take contact, bumping, banging and jumping and going through extra things. Box score: Kentucky 87, Mizzou 66


 


• MIZZOU TALK: Sound off about the 2017-18 season• EYE ON THE TIGERS: Dave Matter's Mizzou blog“I don’t have a timeline,” he added. “The most important thing is he’s healthy and able to play in games. In his case he wants to play and I think that’s a good thing about it. We have to make sure he’s ready to go from my standpoint, the doctor, the trainer and watching him in practice. We need to try to put him in some live-game situations.”

Episode 22: Just how bad was the Missouri men's basketball team's overtime loss to Ole Miss? 




The Tigers could have used Porter’s scoring touch Saturday. Outside of Kassius Robertson (26 points) and, to some degree, Jordan Barnett (11), the rest of Martin’s rotation struggled to generate scoring. Tilmon lasted only 13 minutes before fouling out and matched his five points with five turnovers. Jontay Porter never looked comfortable against UK’s frontcourt and fouled out with four points on 1-of-8 shooting.After shooting just 2 of 20 from 3-point range in the first matchup Feb. 3, Kentucky quickly warmed up from deep, hitting four of its first five attempts to grab an early 16-8 lead. The Tigers snapped out of their typical early haze and answered with an 8-0 run on back-to-back Robertson 3-pointers.The pace picked up midway through the half, and while the Tigers continued to attack the Cats inside, even with Tilmon on the bench with two fouls, UK stayed hot on the perimeter, hitting two more 3s from Shai Gilgeous-Alexander and Quade Green. UK broke another tie with a 7-0 run, again connecting on jump shots, an 18-footer from Green followed by a 3-pointer from Wenyen Gabriel. Nine of UK’s first 10 field goals came on jumpers.

In the half’s final minutes,UK discovered its transition game. And that can be scary for any opponent.

26-Feb-18,Georgia track and field finish out the SEC indoor championship with three more titles,"The Georgia track and field team came powering through on the last day of the SEC indoor championship in College Station, Texas on Feb. 25th to secure three more titles for the Bulldogs.The fourth-ranked women's team scored a total of 84.5 points to place second overall behind Arkansas, 108, and in front of Kentucky, 74. The men placed 5th overall with 71 points behind Alabama, 91, Arkansas, 88, and Florida, 83.5.True freshman Lynna Irby took home a pair of school records and finished second in the world and fourth in school history with a time of 50.62 in the 400-meter. This earned her second place in the SEC indoor championships in the 400-meter. She won the 200-meter with a time of 22.66 to beat out the previous school record of 22.96 and take the title of the world’s fastest time this year.

Orji now will take the first conference crown in this event for the women since Debbie Ferguson won in 1995 with a time of 23.56. Orji’s first attempt at the triple jump was 45 feet, 10 ½ inches, but she managed to secure her win with a 46-6.25. This puts her in the No. 10 spot on the top-10 collegiate list.After winning the 60-meter hurdles on Saturday, true freshman Tara Davis took fifth in the finals and fifth in the long jump to end out Sunday.Sophomore Amber Tanner scored her second best personal record in the 800-meter and secured fourth place.Competing strongly on Saturday, junior Kate Hall continued that trend on Sunday with her second fastest time of her career, 7.27, to take seventh place in the 60-meter finals.Finally for the Lady Bulldogs, junior Hailey Branch took sixth inthe 5000-meter with a career best time of 16:42.24.“We had some really outstanding performances and I was excited about Lynna’s records to wrap up today,” said head coach Petros Kyprianou. “Overall, our teams followed the momentum started on Saturday.”For the men’s team, freshman Johannes Erm won his seventh heptathlon title with a personal best of 5,716 points. He placed third overall in the 60-meter hurdles with a time of 8.28. Senior Karl Saluri was first in the 60-meter hurdles and Erm was third after Saturday, but due to an injury could not compete on Sunday and Erm took advantage of this to compete strongly. Erm also won the 1000-meter with a time of 2:41.77.Senior Cejhae Greene matched his personal record time of 6.62 in the 60-meter finals with a runner-up honors. Along with him in the 60-meter finals, was junior Kendal Williams who placed fourth with a time of 6.64.


 


After competing solidly on Saturday, junior Denzel Comenentia continued to improve with each weight throw with a 64-2.50 to earn third place and rank third nationally.Junior Michael Nicholls placed fourth in the 60-meter hurdles with a time of 7.84. This was his first time competing in this SEC meet after transferring to UGA in January.In the men’s 5000-meter, junior Eric Westog placed seventh with a time of 14:27.97.“Now it’s time to focused, get healthy and prepare ourselves for the NCAA meet,” Kyprianou said.",Lindsay van Houten | Contributor,sports,https://www.redandblack.com/sports/track/georgia-track-and-field-finish-out-the-sec-indoor-championship/article_3f9f368e-1afd-11e8-a0e7-f783f7a3761d.html
26-Feb-18,The Weinstein Company set to declare bankruptcy,"The Weinstein Company is headed for bankruptcy.The world-famous film studio - which was co-founded by disgraced movie producer Harvey Weinstein - is set to file for bankruptcy after negotiations to sell its assets to an investor group collapsed.In a statement, the company said: ""The Weinstein Company has been engaged in an active sale process in the hopes of preserving assets and jobs.


 


""Today, those discussions concluded without a signed agreement.""While we recognize that this is an extremely unfortunate outcome for our employees, our creditors and any victims, the Board has no choice but to pursue the only viable option to maximize the company's remaining value: an orderly bankruptcy process.""The board had been trying to sell to a consortium headed by Maria Conteras-Sweet in a deal worth around $500 million that would have seen a new, largely-female board take control.However, negotiations collapsed earlier this month when the New York attorney general's office filed a civil rights lawsuit against the firm and its co-founders over the allegations of sexual misconduct, accusing them of ""repeatedly"" breaking the city's laws by ""failing to protect employees from pervasive sexual harassment, intimidation and discrimination.""Since the first allegations became public in October last year, more than 50 women have come forward to accuse the Hollywood producer of assault or harassment.Weinstein - who was sacked by the studio shortly after the accusations came to light - is currently under investigation by police in the US and the UK.However, no charges have yet been brought.The 65-year-old producer has previously admitted to having ""caused a lot of pain"", but he's also denied many of the accusations he's now facing.


 


The Weinstein Company was founded in 2005 by Harvey and his brother Bob Weinstein, who owns 23 percent of the firm.The brothers created the company after leaving Miramax, which they founded in 1979, and it has since become one of the largest mini-major film studios in the world.",By Celebretainment,lifestyles,https://www.redandblack.com/lifestyles/entertainment/the-weinstein-company-set-to-declare-bankruptcy/article_cda511dc-a245-535d-8e6b-5279dd361727.html
